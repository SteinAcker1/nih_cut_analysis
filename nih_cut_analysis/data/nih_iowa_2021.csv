"No NIH Category available","Project SummaryNeurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common monogenic developmental disorders affecting ~1 in3500 individuals worldwide. Some form of cognitive or neuropsychiatric dysfunction is present inapproximately 50-80% of individuals with NF1 and these are considered to be major causes of lifetimemorbidity. The neurofibromin protein (Nf1) directly inhibits Ras signaling but also affects several othersignaling cascades (possibly indirectly). The complexity of the signaling cascades implicated inneurofibromatosis 1 combined with the lack of drugs to target Nf1 directly highlights the pressing need fornew approaches to target NF1 phenotypes. Uncovering genetic modifiers of neurofibromatosis 1-relatedcellular dysfunction would provide potential new targets for treating this disorder.This project will focus on hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors in Drosophila loss of function Nf1 mutants. Thelarge effect size of these behavioral deficits will enable their use it as a readout to unravel both the in vivomolecular and circuit functions of the neurofibromin protein in a powerful genetic model organism. SpecificAims will investigate the circuit mechanisms underlying hyperactivity in NF1 deficiency dissect the molecularmechanisms of Nf1-regulated hyperactivity and discover the roles of novel genes underlying the developmentof NF1 phenotypes."," ","Mechanisms of Nf1 Pathophysiology Underlying Hyperactivity","Project NarrativeNeurofibromatosis type 1 is one of the most common developmental disorders which often affectsneuropsychiatric function in afflicted individuals. This project will examine how Nf1 mutations affect behaviorand neuronal circuit function in an animal model of neurofibromatosis type 1.

This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affectingtranslational science that required institutional solutions such as transforming regulatory processes for humansubjects research developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and otherhealth care data establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations and revitalizing thepipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers.Iowa is a rural state which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these ruralconsiderations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams todevelop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches thatovercome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practicenetworks of family physicians clinics school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learningplatforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move researchBeyond Our Borders we have created methods to capture real-time real-life data from the home and tocorrelate this environmentally specific comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging withother CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop theevidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Thoughdistance and rurality drive our approaches the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially betterways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients healthcare teams andacademicians.

Although patients with these tumors may have prolonged survival despite advanced stage further understanding of the molecular biologic basis of NETs holds the promise for improved diagnosis imaging and therapy. We hypothesize that analyzing the gene expression profiles of these tumors and their exomes will allow us to identify important genes that will facilitate clinical advances for patients with these tumors. This contribution will be significant because it will allow us to determine the tumor site of origin in patients presenting with liver metastases and unknown primaries which will lead to more directed surgical exploration and resection; and knowledge of cell surface receptors or other genes significantly over-expressed in NETs relative to normal tissues will facilitate the development of new targets for detection imaging and medical management. Novel targets for therapy will also be suggested by the identification of frequently mutated or deleted genes in these tumors or the germline of patients with familial NETs.","Biological;Cell Surface Receptors;Characteristics;Clinical;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic Imaging;Distant Metastasis;Excision;Family;Future;Gastrointestinal Neoplasms;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic;Genomic approach;Germ-Line Mutation;Goals;Hormonal;Human;Image;Incidence;Knowledge;Ligands;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Modality;Molecular;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pancreas;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Play;Primary Neoplasm;Proteins;RNA;Recording of previous events;Research;Role;Site;Small Intestines;Somatic Mutation;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Survival Rate;Susceptibility Gene;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Work;base;effective therapy;exome;exome sequencing;gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor;improved;innovation;insight;new therapeutic target;novel;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;protein expression;receptor;research clinical testing;targeted treatment;transcriptome;treatment site;treatment strategy;tumor","Project 3: A Genomic Approach to Improved Diagnosis and Treatment of Neuroendocrine Tumors","Understanding the gene expression and mutational profiles of NETs represents an ideal opportunity for developing new diagnostic imaging and therapeutic modalities for these tumors.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Precision Medicine; Rare Diseases","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are indolent malignancies that are increasing in incidence display profound resistance to conventional therapies and are a growing clinical challenge. Mechanisms underlying NET development are only partly understood and diagnostic / prognostic biomarkers of the disease are lacking. While progress in managing pancreatic NETs (PNETs) over the past several decades has been slow new targeted therapies such as mTOR inhibitors have emerged as we've learned more about molecular mechanisms of PNET pathogenesis. Mounting evidence suggests that greater benefits (improved efficacy and reduced resistance) will be obtained by targeting multiple steps of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Better understanding of PI3K/Akt/mTOR regulation and identification of PNET biomarkers that risk stratify patients into subgroups of those who will (or will not) respond to particular therapies will improve patient treatment. This project was developed with those goals in mind. Aim 1 builds upon our discovery that RABL6A (a novel oncoprotein) is essential for PNET cell survival and proliferation Akt/mTOR activity and control of other clinically relevant PNET pathways such as Rb1. Aim 2 which is based on pilot studies that identified several chromosomal alterations capable of discriminating pancreatic from ileal NETs (including RABL6A amplification on chr 9q) seeks to define new DNA and protein biomarkers that distinguish four different types of NETs (pancreatic ileal bronchial and cervical). The integration of findings from Aims 1 and 2 will establish novel relationships between the status of drug-targetable PNET pathways (RABL6A-Akt/mTOR RABL6A-Rb1) with genetic alterations that discriminate NET type and prognosis thus advancing clinical management of this disease. Aim 1. Define clinically relevant therapeutic targets that control PNET proliferation and survival. Aim 2. Identify genetic and proteomic biomarkers that discriminate NET type and prognosis. This research will identify molecular alterations that are common or unique to various types of NETs as well as primary versus metastatic tumors. Pilot studies have already identified RABL6A and other specific genetic alterations as strong candidate PNET biomarkers and proposed pre-clinical studies will determine the efficacy of unique drug combinations that target RABL6A effector pathways for reducing PNET burden. The most immediate clinical outcome of this translational project will be the development of fast and inexpensive genetic (FISH-based) and proteomic (IHC-based) tests for differentiating various types of NETs in patients. This should markedly improve NET diagnosis classification prognosis and treatment.","Automobile Driving;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;Cervical;Chemoresistance;Chromosome abnormality;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Management;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Management;Drug Combinations;Drug Targeting;Excision;FRAP1 gene;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Freezing;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Genetic;Goals;Human;Image;Immunohistochemistry;Incidence;Indolent;Islet Cell Tumor;Link;Location;Longevity;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Microarray Analysis;Mind;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal tissue morphology;Oncogenic;Oncoproteins;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pancreas;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology Study;Pilot Projects;Primary Neoplasm;Prognosis;Prognostic Marker;Proteins;Proteomics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Retinoblastoma Protein;SDZ RAD;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Specimen;Study models;Subgroup;Testing;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Training;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Biology;Tumor Burden;Tumor Markers;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;clinically relevant;cohort;conventional therapy;diagnostic biomarker;effective therapy;genetic signature;genetic testing;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mouse model;neoplastic cell;neuroendocrine differentiation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel diagnostics;novel drug combination;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;patient stratification;pre-clinical;preclinical study;primary outcome;prognostic assays;protein biomarkers;risk stratification;targeted treatment;therapeutic biomarker;therapeutic target;tumor","Project 2: Molecular Mechanisms and Biomarkers of Neuroendocrine Tumors","The molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) is poorly understood and NET biomarkers are lacking.

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) constitute an unrecognized health threat to children and adults. The incidence and prevalence of NETs is rising in the United States; yet there is very little research on NETs and no effective treatment for patients with metastatic disease over half of whom die within five years of diagnosis according to latest SEER data. These tumors do not respond to conventional chemotherapy or external beam radiation making development of new diagnostic and therapeutic options imperative. We hypothesize that theranostics use of a single compound as both a therapeutic and a diagnostic agent will meet this critical need for children and adults with NETs. The translational component of this proposal will identify new theranostic targets design and synthesize new targeting agents and test their efficacy in vivo. Lead compounds that meet strict criteria as high affinity PET tracers and molecularly targeted therapeutic agents in pre-clinical models of bronchial small bowel or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors will be brought forward to  first in human PET imaging trials through an Exploratory IND mechanisms. Specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesize unique high-affinity stable ligands for use in GPCR targeted theranostics. Expression data from Project 3 has identified three GPCR (OXTR VPAC1 MC1R) as new targets in NETs. Theranostic radiopharmaceuticals will be designed and synthesized using NMR and 3-D modeling to guide chemical modifications that enhance affinity specificity and stability of candidate ligands. Peptide libraries incorporating D- and unnatural amino acids cyclization strategies and lysine substitutions for DOTA conjugation will be synthesized; binding affinity specificity and stability will be determined in vitro. 2. Characterize in vivo specificity stability pharmacokinetics and cytotoxicity of new GPCR targeted theranostic compounds in mouse models of neuroendocrine tumors. We will conduct theranostic pre- clinical in vitro and in vivo testing of lead GPCR targeted ligands in mouse models of NETs with the goal of having at least two analogs ready to test as PET tracers in humans by year 5. 3. Examine safety and efficacy of new GPCR targeted PET tracers in humans using exploratory IND. Agents that pass rigorous pre-clinical testing will then be synthesized under GMP conditions. An exploratory IND will be obtained to examine the ability of lead candidates to localize to neuroendocrine tumors in first in human trials. Successful tracers that meet the strict theranostic criteria and demonstrate safety specificity and reproducibility as a PET tracer in patients with NETs will be further developed through a full IND.

"Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Radiation Oncology","The Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor SPORE Clinical Research Core (CRC) has as its primary goal to enable each project to bring the fruit of its scientific research to a clinical end point that will benefit patients both proximally and in the future. The Clinical Research Core is the direct translational link between research projects and clinical research emanating from these projects. This Core is directed by Thomas M. O'Dorisio MD with Daniel Vaena MD and Terry Braun PhD as co-directors; these directors are all members of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Core are to: 1) Continue to consent and enroll patients into the Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry and to  further develop the Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Database 2) Coordinate and perform SPORE clinical trials protocols. The CRC will provide a critical link  between clinical research and the projects cores and developmental research projects; 3) Review validity of and coordinate incorporation of new genetic pathologic and imaging tests developed by Projects into new clinical trials. Aim 1. The CRC obtains consent from newly diagnosed and referred patients with NETs abstracts and enters clinical and epidemiologic data into the Neuroendocrine Tumor Database (REDCap) and systematically manages and treats patients through death. Tumor tissue and peripheral blood serum cells DNA and RNA are prospectively collected stored and tracked in LabMatrix"" by the Biospecimens Core for linkage to the database. This provides integrated and centralized access to SPORE investigators for NET research projects. The Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Clinic and Registry were established by Dr. O'Dorisio in 2000 and over 1300 subjects (and family members) with NETs have been consented to this Registry. Aim 1 goals are to continue to recruit new patients to participate in the Registry and to continually maintain update and upgrade the databases that support the Registry. Patient data from each visit is entered regularly. Aim 2. Iowa SPORE investigators have been active in design and conduct of both investigator-initiated and NCI cooperative group trials for patients with NETs. These trials have encompassed imaging and dosimetry trials therapeutic trials of new targeted biologicals and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT); and the only Phase I trial of PRRT for children and adolescents. Key functions of the CRC in Aim 2 are to coordinate the development of clinical trials assist in patient accrual manage IRB consents and amendments for protocols report adverse events to appropriate agencies and provide comprehensive quality control (e.g. monitor for protocol deviations & clinical trial data performance). Aim 3. As suggested by reviewers the CRC will facilitate incorporation of recent scientific SPORE advances into SPORE clinical trials. Projects 1 2 3 and 4 are poised to develop new imaging agents genetic tests and immunohistochemistry panels. The CRC will guide and assist investigators in obtaining FDA approval for new agents and tests. CRC will then aide in incorporation of FDA approved advances into clinical practice.","90Y;Adolescent;Adverse event;Amendment;Biological;Biological Specimen database;Cells;Cessation of life;Child;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical trial protocol document;Collection;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Consent;DNA;Data;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Distant Metastasis;Doctor of Philosophy;Enrollment;FDA approved;Family;Family member;Fruit;Future;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Markers;Goals;Heart;Human;Image;Immunohistochemistry;Industry;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;Iowa;Isotope Therapy;Laboratories;Link;Long-Term Care;Longterm Follow-up;Malignant Neoplasms;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Molecular Target;Monitor;Neuroendocrine Tumors;New Agents;Newly Diagnosed;PET/CT scan;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Receptor;Peptides;Performance;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Preparation;Prognostic Marker;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;Quality of life;RNA;Radiation therapy;Radionuclide therapy;Records;Regional Disease;Registries;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Scientist;Serum;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Specimen;Symptoms;System;Testing;Therapeutic Trials;Time;Tissue Microarray;Translational Research;Tumor Tissue;United States;Update;Visit;clinical database;clinical development;clinical practice;data de-identification;design;diagnostic biomarker;disorder prevention;dosimetry;epidemiologic data;genetic testing;imaging agent;member;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular pathology;neuroendocrine differentiation;novel diagnostics;patient population;peripheral blood;phase I trial;programs;prospective;rare cancer;recruit;theranostics;therapeutic target;treatment response;tumor registry","Core C - Clinical Research","Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have few opportunities to participate in clinical trials due to the scarcity of NCI sponsored investigator-initiated or cooperative group trials for these rare malignancies.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Health Disparities; Minority Health","The Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) SPORE Biospecimens Core provides a coordinated centralized and dedicated core for the procurement processing and annotation of biospecimens from patients in our Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry and also from SEER Residual Tissue Repositories. The primary goal of the Biospecimens Core is to procure a variety of biologic specimens on patients with neuroendocrine tumors. These specimens will include fresh or rapidly frozen specimens from patients who have signed the Iowa NET Registry consent as well as de-identified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens obtained through the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) residual tissue repository (RTR). All specimens will be tracked and stored under conditions that optimize their utility for molecular studies assuring the Iowa NET SPORE investigators have access to a large number of a wide variety of NET tumor normal and germline specimens. All biospecimens will be collected tracked and distributed to SPORE researchers following the established protocols of the Iowa Tumor Procurement Core (TPC) in the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center (HCCC) and the Iowa SEER. All specimens are collected and processed under tight quality control tracked and distributed to SPORE researchers or banked for future SPORE research projects. The Core tracks the acquisition distribution and results obtained on these specimens allowing integration with clinical and other data collected in research projects. The Core benefits from the expertise in the HCCC but does not duplicate its services. The Core supports each of the full and developmental projects. There has been extensive utilization of these biospecimens with resulting clinical and phenotypic data already in our Iowa NET Database. We will continue to accrue new patient samples as well as repository FFPE specimens and will continually work with investigators to utilize this increasingly valuable resource for these orphan tumors. Specific Aims of the Biospecimens Core are: 1) Collect process bank and distribute excess surgical specimens and/or blood/buccal swabs from patients and family members who have signed consent to participate in the Iowa NET Registry; 2) Acquire process and distribute de-identified neuroendocrine tumor FFPE specimens obtained through the Iowa Virtual Tumor Repository and SEER Residual Tissue Repository; 3) Provide accurate diagnosis and grade on all tumor specimens according to North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS) guidelines; 4) Work with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to maintain data obtained from Iowa NET Registry biospecimens and SEER Repository biospecimens to further collaborative research leading to improved long term outcomes for patients with NETs.","American;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Specimen Banks;Biometry;Biopsy;Blood;Blood specimen;California;Classification Scheme;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Complex;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Consent;Cryopreservation;DNA;Data;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Family member;Formalin;Freezing;Future;Gene Expression;Genotype;Goals;Guidelines;Hawaii;Health;Human;Institution;Iowa;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orphan;Paraffin;Paraffin Embedding;Pathologic;Pathologist;Pathology Report;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phenotype;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;RNA;Registries;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Residual state;Resources;SEER Program;Sampling;Secure;Services;Site;Societies;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Specimen;Staging;Swab;Tissue Banks;Tissue Embedding;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translating;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Work;accurate diagnosis;exome sequencing;improved;patient registry;phenotypic data;preservation;rare cancer;repository;tumor;tumor registry;virtual","Core B - Biospecimens","Well-characterized pathologically and clinically annotated tumor tissues from patients with neuroendocrine tumors are a critical and valuable resource for translating the basic molecular and biological understanding of neuroendocrine tumors into improved treatments for these patients.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rare tumors present several challenges including lack of evidence based treatment recommendations unwillingness of insurance companies to support unproven therapies and keen competition for translational research support that may benefit only a small proportion of all cancer patients. Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) targeted in this proposal are rare tumors that face all of these challenges. NETs arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system occur in both adults and children and are increasing in both incidence and prevalence in the United States. The University of Iowa is one of only a handful of academic or private institutions in the US where patients with NETs are diagnosed treated and regularly followed in a comprehensive manner. A multi-disciplinary NET clinic an IRB approved registry and database and a growing translational research program are housed at the University of Iowa. We have collaborated with pharmaceutical and biotech companies patient support groups and other research institutions whose expertise complements our clinical and translational expertise to build a neuroendocrine tumor Center of Excellence. Iowa is poised to house the first SPORE in neuroendocrine tumors where academic industry and philanthropic organizations will partner with NCI to increase the length and quality of life for these unique patients. Our Overall Specific Aims are: 1. Support innovative translational research in Neuroendocrine Tumors. 2. Provide support to translational investigators through interactive cores. 3. Enlist and encourage new translational researchers in neuroendocrine tumors through developmental projects and career development. 4. Promote early and accurate diagnosis through outreach to physicians and advocacy groups.","90Y;Adult;Advocacy;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Biotechnology;Bone Marrow;Cancer Patient;Child;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Communication;Complement;Data Analyses;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic Procedure;Diffuse;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;Evidence based treatment;Face;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genomic approach;Human;Image;Incidence;Industry;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;Insurance;Investments;Iowa;Islet Cell Tumor;Kidney;Length;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Mutate;Neuroendocrine Therapy;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Physicians;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prevalence;Privatization;Prognostic Marker;Quality Control;Quality of life;Radiation Dose Unit;Radioisotopes;Recommendation;Registries;Research;Research Support;Resistance;Small Intestines;Source;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Structure;Support Groups;Toxic effect;Tracer;Translating;Translational Research;Tumor Bank;Tumor Tissue;United States;Universities;accurate diagnosis;career development;chemotherapeutic agent;data quality;exome;imaging agent;improved;innovation;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular marker;multidisciplinary;new therapeutic target;novel diagnostics;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;outreach;patient population;public health relevance;rare cancer;targeted radiotherapeutic;theranostics;therapeutic target;translational research program;translational scientist;tumor","Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Human Cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuroendocrine tumors are slow growing well-differentiated yet relentlessly progressing malignancies that demonstrate near complete resistance to chemotherapeutic agents.

"Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Stroke","AbstractHaving a stroke is a frightening experience for both the patient and their loved ones. A major source of anxietyis not knowing what stroke-related deficits will persist  will my loved one ever be able to talk again? Thelikelihood for recovery is estimated by the treating neurologist or rehabilitation specialist based on theirpersonal experience. There are no tools available that can use information about the location of the strokequery it against the outcomes from hundreds or thousands of other individuals and generate a personalizedquantitative prediction of stroke-related deficits and prognosis for long-term recovery. Here we propose todevelop such a tool. At the University of Iowa we have one of the most comprehensive lesion registries in theworld of some 3500 patients with focal acquired brain lesions neuroimaging and extensive data on outcomes.We propose to capitalize on this unique resource by developing a tool to predict cognitive outcomes fromstroke based on lesion location. First we propose to map brain regions most associated with specific cognitivedeficits across over 1000 patients including symptoms such as difficulty speaking or problems with attention.Next in a prospectively collected cohort with acute ischemic stroke we will attempt to predict cognitiveoutcomes by querying lesion location against the aforementioned symptom maps. We hypothesize that lesionlocation will be a significant predictor of chronic cognitive outcomes. Second we have recently developed aninnovative strategy that links lesion-associated deficits to specific brain networks. It combines traditional lesionmapping with human connectome data from healthy adults to infer what networks are disrupted by focal brainlesions. We will evaluate whether this lesion network mapping approach can be used to compliment thetraditional lesion mapping approach to predict additional variance in cognitive outcomes. Finally we will useadvanced statistical modeling to evaluate how predictive information from lesion location can be optimallyintegrated with demographic information and baseline screening cognitive performance to maximizepredictions of chronic cognitive outcomes in a longitudinal cohort. By addressing these objectives we will laythe foundation for developing a clinical tool that can be applied to a clinically-acquired MRI scan to aid indetermining the prognosis of cognitive outcomes a key factor that will help in the early managementrehabilitation and life planning for patients with stroke.","Acute;Address;Adult;Age;Anxiety;Attention;Brain;Brain region;Chronic;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Data;Databases;Decision Making;Diagnosis;Education;Factor Analysis;Focal Brain Injuries;Foundations;Gender;Handedness;Human;Impaired cognition;Individual;International;Iowa;Ischemic Stroke;Language;Lesion;Life;Link;Location;Longitudinal cohort;MRI Scans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Manuals;Maps;Masks;Medical;Memory;Methods;Neurologist;Neuropsychological Tests;Neurosciences Research;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patients;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Prognosis;Provider;Recovery;Registries;Rehabilitation therapy;Resources;Risk;Scanning;Site;Source;Specialist;Statistical Models;Stroke;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Symptoms;Testing;Translating;Universities;Work;base;clinical care;cognitive performance;cognitive testing;cohort;common symptom;connectome;connectome data;demographics;design;disability;disabling symptom;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;loved ones;multiple data sources;neuroimaging;outcome prediction;performance tests;personalized predictions;post stroke;prospective;public health relevance;screening;stroke outcome;stroke patient;tool;vascular risk factor","Predicting Cognitive Outcomes from Stroke Based on Lesion Location","Public Health RelevanceWe propose to map specific domains of cognitive impairment that occur following focal brain injury such asdeficits in language memory and attention to specific brain regions.

The goal of this application is todetermine how pro-inflammatory signaling via NF-kB instructs HSC fate in the vertebrate embryo and how thisprocess is regulated by Progranulin a (Pgrna) with the ultimate goal of replicating HSC generation in vitro forclinical utility. My working hypothesis is that early pro-inflammatory inputs converge to activate NF-kB which inturn activates key signaling events in the specification of HSC fate. These pro-inflammatory signals need to bedownregulated soon after HSC specification; my preliminary results suggest that Pgrna functions in this manner.To test these hypotheses this proposal consists of 2 aims: (1) Characterize the role of NF-kB in HSCspecification; and (2) identify the role of Pgrna in HSC emergence. This study will be conducted in zebrafishwhich are an ideal system for direct visualization of HSCs and have served as a model organism to study humandisease. To achieve this applications goals novel transgenic and mutant lines will be generated and qPCRFACS-sorting RNA-seq and confocal microscopy techniques will be utilized. Dr. Espin Palazon is a postdoctoral fellow in David Travers laboratory at UCSD whose ultimate careergoal is to lead an independent research group focused on stem cells at a major research institution. Her short-term goals are (1) to determine the spatiotemporal requirements of NF-kB within hemogenic endothelium andthe downstream genes regulated to specify HSCs; and (2) to elucidate how Pgrna governs HSC emergence.She was recruited to join Dr. Travers group because of her strong background in immunology and the zebrafishanimal model. The project outlined in this proposal will allow Dr. Espin Palazon to transition from a mentoredscientific position to an independent research career helping her gain expertise in FACS sorting RNA-seqgenome editing techniques and HSC biology all of which are fundamental to establish her independent lab. Dr.Espin Palazon will meet and present her work to experts in development immunology and hematology inaddition to presenting her data to a formal mentorship committee comprised of senior experts that will aid hertransition to an independent researcher. UCSD offers numerous courses that Dr. Espin Palazon will attend aswell as seminars on career development and laboratory management. The vibrant collaborative scientificatmosphere at UCSD is an ideal environment for Dr. Espin Palazon to develop during the mentored phase ofher award and will be instrumental in forming the foundation for the future success of these studies.

"Anxiety Disorders; Back Pain; Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Complementary and Integrative Health; Health Services; Mental Health; Pain Research; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)","ABSTRACTThe prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among U.S. adults is estimated at 20% with 50-80% of peoplereporting a significant episode at some point in their life and 23% of LBP patients reporting pain of highintensity with disability. The greatest burden placed on society occurs when LBP becomes chronic (cLBP).Inadequately managed chronic pain results in greater loss of productivity; increased expenditures forhospitalization surgery and medications; and costly out-of-pocket patient expenses. Given their high rates ofmusculoskeletal disease cLBP-related disability is rampant within our nation's Veteran population. Thecombination of cLBP and high medication use negatively impacts Veterans' work productivity and quality of lifeand generates substantial risk for long-term disability and opioid addiction. There is arguably no moreimportant population than Veterans for performing research to evaluate effective non-pharmacologicaltreatments that are safe pain relieving cost-effective and contain promise to restore function and quality oflife. One such option is chiropractic care. Several key factors support the need to deepen the study ofchiropractic care within the Veteran population: 1) biological models offer strong support for plausibility; 2)sufficient strength of evidence in systematic reviews has garnered a recommendation by American College ofPhysicians for spinal manipulation and/or chiropractic care targeting cLBP and 3) since beginning in 2004 theVeterans Health Administration (VA) has successfully integrated 115 doctors of chiropractic into ambulatorycare settings. These advances in chiropractic care integration have occurred despite substantial knowledgegaps particularly within VA. Specifically studies examining the delivery of chiropractic interventions have beenhighly variable and there is no optimal dosing in terms of treatment duration or number of visits. Thus theproposed study of Veterans age 18 and older with a diagnosis of cLBP is highly significant. Demonstrationproject investigators will work closely with the NIH-DOD-VA Collaboratory to accomplish the following projectAims: 1) Plan and develop the pragmatic research infrastructure needed to deliver a rigorous multi-siterandomized controlled trial within the VA addressing 15 milestones in four categories of activities; 2) Evaluatethe comparative effectiveness of a low dose (1-5 visits) of standard chiropractic care against a higher dose (8-12 visits) in Veterans with cLBP; 3) Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of chiropractic chronic painmanagement (CCPM) compared to usual care following the initial treatment described in Aim 1; 4) Evaluatethe impact of CCPM on health services outcomes compared to usual care; 5) Evaluate patient and clinicianperceptions of non-specific treatment factors effectiveness of study interventions and impact of the varyingdoses of standard chiropractic care and the CCPM on clinical outcomes across 3 VA facilities using a mixedmethod process evaluation approach.","Address;Adult;Age;Alcohol consumption;Ambulatory Care;American College of Physicians;Anxiety;Biological Models;Caring;Categories;Chronic;Client satisfaction;Clinical;Diagnosis;Doctor of Chiropractic;Dose;Drug Prescriptions;Effectiveness;Evaluation;Expenditure;Health;Health Services;Hospitalization;Infrastructure;Injections;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Knowledge;Life;Low Back Pain;Low Prevalence;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Methods;Modification;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Operative Surgical Procedures;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Outcome;Pain;Pain intensity;Pain interference;Participant;Patients;Pattern;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physical therapy;Policies;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Preparation;Process;Productivity;Provider;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Risk;Schedule;Services;Site;Societies;Spinal Manipulation;System;Treatment Factor;Uncertainty;United States National Institutes of Health;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;Visit;Woman;Work;chiropracty;chronic pain;chronic pain management;collaboratory;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;cost;cost effective;design;disability;effectiveness study;evidence base;functional outcomes;functional restoration;health service use;military veteran;multimodality;outcome prediction;pain outcome;pain patient;pain relief;primary endpoint;primary outcome;productivity loss;randomized trial;secondary outcome;systematic review;treatment arm;treatment as usual;treatment duration;treatment group","Chiropractic Care for Veterans: A Pragmatic Randomized Trial Addressing Dose Effects for cLBP","PROJECT NARRATIVEThere is a pressing need to address the devastating impact of cLBP in Veteran populations. Prior researchindicates that chiropractic care increasingly integrated into the VHA system may have a positive impact.However chiropractic care has not been studied in the Veterans. In addition considerable uncertainty existsregarding optimal patterns of chiropractic use. The short-term pain and functional outcomes associated withvarying numbers of initial visits and the long-term effectiveness of chiropractic care within the context of real-world delivery at VHAs in terms of clinical impact is unknown. In addition we know very little regardingoutcomes resulting from the broader range of evidence-based chiropractic care strategies most commonlypracticed in real world settings. Thus the proposed demonstration project - an appropriately powered multisiteRCT specifically designed to rigorously address both of these issues - is highly significant and has the potentialto directly impact chiropractic utilization policy within the VHA and beyond regardless of outcome.","NCCIH","10472339","8/24/2021","RFA-AT-17-001","3UH3AT009761-05S1","3","UH3","AT","009761","05","S1","MURRAY, PETER DANIEL","9/20/2017","8/31/2023","ZAT1-VS(05)"," ","1947045","LONG, CYNTHIA R","GOERTZ, CHRISTINE MARIE","01","NONE","075845834","NJ24BM8CYWZ3","075845834","NJ24BM8CYWZ3","US","41.529376","-90.574829","1648601","PALMER COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC","DAVENPORT","IA","SCHOOLS OF CHIROPRACTIC","528035214","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","8/31/2022"," ","213","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","92108"," ","NCCIH","63631","28477"," ","92108",
"Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Diabetes; Hypertension; Kidney Disease; Nutrition","Project Summary / AbstractHypertension in patients with Metabolic Syndrome incurs a large financial societal and health cost in theUnited States. Despite several lines of evidence that hypertension in the Metabolic Syndrome has a distinctcause from idiopathic (essential) hypertension this cause is not known and patients are treated empirically.Contributions from many labs over the last 30 years have supported the hypothesis that enhanced insulinsignaling in the kidney plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The Applicant's preliminary dataconfirms the hypothesis that insulin action in the kidney contributes to hypertension in a mouse model ofMetabolic Syndrome and suggests that proximal tubular sodium transport may be increased expanding bloodvolume and increasing blood pressure. The Applicant has (1) characterized: a mouse model to study theintersection of the kidney blood pressure and Metabolic Syndrome and (2) generated a novel inducible tubuleinsulin receptor knockout mouse to study the contribution of insulin receptor signaling to sodium transport andblood pressure. In addition to the Applicant's contributions the mentoring and scientific environment make himan ideal candidate to develop independence in renal physiology research addressing this important question.Here the Applicant proposes three aims to study the contribution of insulin receptor signaling in the MetabolicSyndrome to acute pressure natriuresis (Aim 1) to regulators of proximal tubule sodium transporter activity inresponse to acute and chronic hypertension (Aim 2) and to patterns within the proximal tubule epithelial celltranscriptome generated by insulin receptor signaling the Metabolic Syndrome or both (Aim 3). Successfulcompletion of these aims will begin to bridge the gap in knowledge between the role of insulin in whole animalphysiology and transporter activity and regulation in individual cells. In addition through this trainingmechanism the Applicant will learn the skills to successfully conduct independent research in basic sciencenephrology.","Acute;Address;Affect;American;Animals;Apical;Area;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Blood;Blood Pressure;Blood Volume;Cells;Chronic;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Disease;Dose;Environment;Epithelial Cells;Essential Hypertension;Excretory function;Faculty;Feedback;Financial cost;Future;Genes;Glucose;Health;Health Care Costs;Hormones;Hyperinsulinism;Hypertension;Impairment;Individual;Infusion procedures;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;Insulin Resistance;Kidney;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Learning Skill;Measures;Medical;Mentors;Metabolic syndrome;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Mus;Natriuresis;Nephrology;Obesity;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Physicians;Physiology;Play;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Renal tubule structure;Research;Risk;Role;Scientist;Sodium;Surface;System;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Training;Tubular formation;United States;Wild Type Mouse;Work;Zucker Rats;career;insulin signaling;interest;kidney dysfunction;mouse model;novel;pressure;receptor expression;response;salt sensitive;sequencing platform;societal costs;tool;trafficking;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing","Contribution of Renal Tubule Insulin Receptor on Proximal Tubule Sodium Transport and Hypertension int he Metabolic Syndrome","Project NarrativeMillions of Americans have Metabolic Syndrome a disease closely related to diabetes which significantlyincreases the risk of developing high blood pressure.

"Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Microbiome","Project Summary/AbstractThe diverse group Bacteroidales is a predominant component of human intestinal microbiota linked to numerousdisease processes. Manipulation of Bacteroidales at the genus and species level holds therapeutic potential butrequires a more detailed understanding of the intestinal ecosystem. Bacteroides spp. genomes encodepolysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) allowing enzymatic breakdown membrane transport and utilization ofcomplex carbohydrates. Bacteroides spp. antagonize one another within the intestinal environment by deliveringtoxic effectors via contact-dependent type VI secretion systems (T6SS) resulting in altered capacities forcolonization and persistence. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that contact among Bacteroides spp.results in dynamic adaptive responses that alter cellular behavior and contribute to persistence in the intestinalenvironment. The proposed experiments will discover contact-dependent proteomic responses important forcompetition within Bacteroides communities using cutting-edge proteomics technology (Aim 1). Molecularmechanisms of two known contact-dependent responses altered polysaccharide utilization (Aim 2) and T6SS-mediated delivery of hcp-effector fusions (Aim 3) will be elucidated and translated to competitive growth andintestinal colonization in a gnotobiotic mouse model. A long-term research goal is to understand mechanismsunderlying interbacterial interactions among intestinal symbionts for the development of targeted therapeutics.The candidate for this career development award is an M.D./Ph.D. physician scientist with board certification inanatomic and clinical pathology.

"Burden of Illness; Clinical Research; Diabetes; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Pediatric; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYAcute pancreatitis (AP) is increasingly recognized in children with an incidence approachingthat of adults. Most children with pancreatitis have a single mild acute episode that resolveswithout complications. However a subset of children with AP develops recurrent episodes(defined as acute recurrent pancreatitis or ARP) and some progress to chronic pancreatitis(CP). Pediatric ARP and CP significantly impact quality of life and carry high healthcare costs.Few studies have been performed to characterize the natural history pediatric ARP and CP toidentify its risk factors and to determine predictors of disease course. As INSPPIRE(INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) the first multicentermultidisciplinary collaboration in pediatric pancreatitis we determined that children with ARPharbor multiple genetic risk variants and rapidly transition to CP exocrine pancreaticinsufficiency (EPI) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The risk factors that predispose children toearly onset pancreatitis rapid progression to CP and premature loss of exocrine andendocrine function are not well-known. The objective of this application is to delineate thenatural history of pediatric CP through careful prospective analysis of INSPPIRE 2 cohort todefine the impact of genetic modifiers on disease course and to determine the mechanismsinvolved in pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (T3cDM). The overall hypothesis is that geneticfactors predispose children to early onset CP EPI and DM. Our specific aims are: 1)Characterize pediatric CP determine predictors of disease onset and progression; 2) Determinethe impact of genetic variants on disease onset and progression; 3) Identify mechanismsunderlying disturbed glucose regulation in pediatric ARP and CP. This project will provideinsight into the pathophysiology of pediatric pancreatitis investigate the impact of geneticvariants on disease course and explore the mechanisms of early islet cell dysfunction inpediatric ARP and CP.

"Cardiovascular; Duchenne/ Becker Muscular Dystrophy; Genetics; Heart Disease; Lung; Muscular Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","The translation of basic biomedical knowledge to the development of effective therapeutic approaches depends on validated animal models that accurately reflect human diseases and clinically relevant and valid outcome measures. While it is widely appreciated that dystrophinopathy (BDMD) patients suffer progressive loss of skeletal muscle function disease etiology is evolving to include significant cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death due largely to effective respiratory support therapy. While existing models have been and continue to be useful tools for mechanistic studies and initial discovery investigations inherent limitations necessitate the continued development of large animal models for translational research. Hence there is an unmet need to internally and externally validate novel models of BDMD that clearly and predictively recapitulate progressive dysfunction caused by dystrophinopathy as assessed by clinically relevant and validated measures. Our long-term goal is to achieve a detailed understanding of BDMD to enable development and testing of effective interventional strategies. To facilitate these translational studies we have recently initiated the characterization of a novel spontaneously occurring porcine BDMD model (exon 41 point mutation). The objective of this application is to perform internal and external validation studies focused on progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction in order to insert this spontaneously occurring model into the drug discovery pipeline. This objective is buttressed by strong biological and translational rationale demonstrating a genetic cause of the disease consistent with human disease. Further our previous work and preliminary data show resultant progressive skeletal muscle injury and dysfunction and progressive cardiomyopathy which are also consistent with human dystrophinopathy. In the internal validation phase of this proposal during R21 Aim 1 we will internally validate objective measures of locomotion and respiratory function during disease progression. In R21 Aim 2 we will also apply well-validated echocardiography and electrophysiology approaches for use in this model as the disease advances. Together with our clinical partner we will determine if our measures have been internally validated. Should that be the case we will proceed to external validation studies. In the R33 phase to demonstrate predictive validity we will treat affected pigs with pharmacological agents used widely by BDMD patients. Specifically to improve skeletal muscle function pigs will be treated with prednisone and to improve cardiac function pigs will be treated with Lisinopril as both have repeatedly been shown to improve skeletal and cardiac muscle function respectively. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it aims to internally and externally validate progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction in a novel miniature porcine muscular dystrophy model. This research is significant for drug discovery because it would enable for the first time testing of an array of treatment approaches (conventional and gene therapy) in a human-sized model that closely reflects human pathophysiological progression particularly in the cardiovascular system.","Affect;Age-Months;Animal Model;Animal Technicians;Animals;Arrhythmia;Becker Muscular Dystrophy;Biological;Birth;Blinded;Breeding;Canis familiaris;Cardiac;Cardiomyopathies;Cardiovascular system;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Research;Data;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Duchenne muscular dystrophy;Dystrophin;Echocardiography;Electrophysiology (science);Etiology;Exhibits;Exons;Family suidae;Female;Fishes;Functional disorder;Gait;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Hand;Health;Heart;Heart Arrest;Heart Diseases;Histologic;Human;Injury;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Lisinopril;Locomotion;Measures;Mediating;Mission;Modeling;Mus;Muscle;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Myocardium;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patients;Personal Satisfaction;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phase;Phylogenetic Analysis;Physiological;Point Mutation;Positioning Attribute;Prednisone;Probability;Protein Deficiency;Proteins;Research;Respiratory Diaphragm;Respiratory physiology;Rodent;Sinus;Skeletal Muscle;Skeletal muscle injury;Stress;Testing;Time;Translational Research;Translations;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;Ventricular Fibrillation;Ventricular Tachycardia;Wheelchairs;Work;advanced disease;cardioprotection;clinical application;clinically relevant;conventional therapy;disability;drug discovery;dystrophinopathy;effective intervention;experience;gene therapy;heart function;human disease;improved;innovation;novel;porcine model;preclinical trial;respiratory;skeletal muscle wasting;standard of care;success;sudden cardiac death;therapeutically effective;tool;translational study;validation studies","Internal and External Validation of a Porcine Dystrophinopathy Model","The proposed research is relevant to human health because Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophies (BDMD) continue to cause progressive muscle wasting wheel chair confinement and eventually death. Though critical to the advancement of our current understanding of BDMD existing mouse and dog models have limitations that necessitate the continued search and/or development of novel models of dystrophinopathies. With a porcine dystrophinopathy model available drug discovery will be enhanced and preclinical trials more predictive of human outcomes as pigs are more closely related to humans than are dogs or mice and will improve efforts to streamline translational research. Thus the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIHs mission that pertains to reducing the burdens of human disability.","NINDS","10460764","9/6/2021","RFA-NS-16-013","4R33NS106112-03","4","R33","NS","106112","03","","ROOF, REBECCA ","9/1/2021","8/31/2023","Neurological Sciences and Disorders B Study Section[NSD-B]"," ","8734065","SELSBY, JOSHUA T","Not Applicable"," ","VETERINARY SCIENCES","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","US","42.022225","-93.639475","3974801","IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY","AMES","IA","EARTH SCIENCES/RESOURCES","500112025","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","8/31/2023"," ","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","382500"," ","NINDS","250000","132500"," ","382500",
"Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Nutrition; Obesity; Psoriasis","SummaryPsoriasis is the most prevalent and intractable immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease. It is clearthat dendritic cells (DCs) and keratinocytes in the skin tissues play a central role in the pathogenesis ofpsoriasis. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) in promoting psoriasis pathogenesis through simultaneously targeting both DCs and keratinocytes andin linking obesity-associated psoriasis development. E-FABP first cloned in psoriatic skin tissues (also knownas psoriasis associated FABP) has been identified as a critical regulator of both metabolic and inflammatorypathways. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that E-FABP is greatly upregulated in the skin tissue frompatients with psoriasis. Intriguingly deficiency of E-FABP confers protection from imiquimod (IMQ) or IL-23-induced psoriasis-like inflammation in mouse models. While obesity is associated with increased severity ofpsoriasis and poor responses to therapy the underlying mechanisms between obesity and psoriasis areunknown. While high fat diet (HFD) increases E-FABP expression in both DCs and keratinocytes and promotesobesity-associated chronic skin inflammation in wild type mice E-FABP deficiency protects mice against HFD-induced effects. All these data suggest that E-FABP may link obesity and psoriasis via regulating metabolismand function of DCs and keratinocytes. Thus we hypothesize that E-FABP as a new link underlying theobesity-psoriasis association promotes psoriasis pathogenesis through enhancing cellular metabolism andfunction of both DCs and keratinocytes. Therefore targeting E-FABP may represent a novel strategy forpsoriasis therapy. We design three specific aims (Figure A) to address our hypotheses. Specific Aim 1 willaddress how E-FABP regulates DC metabolism and function in psoriasis. We hypothesize that E-FABP linksFA metabolism and innate immune signaling in DCs and bridges innate and adaptive immune responses forpsoriasis pathogenesis. Specific Aim 2 will determine how E-FABP promotes keratinocyte aberrantmetabolism and differentiation in psoriasis. We will design experiments to test the hypothesis that E-FABPexpression in keratinocytes mediates innate signal-induced metabolic changes that are critical for abnormalkeratinocyte differentiation. Specific Aim 3 will examine whether E-FABP links the obesity/psoriasisassociation using our unique E-FABP global and conditional knock out mouse models and samples frompsoriasis patients. In summary this proposal will demonstrate a novel mechanism by which E-FABP promotespsoriasis pathogenesis and links obesity-associated psoriasis development. Thus targeting E-FABP may offera novel strategy for treatment of psoriasis and other inflammatory skin disorders.","Abnormal Keratinocyte;Address;Cell physiology;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chronic;Data;Dendritic Cells;Development;High Fat Diet;Human;Imiquimod;Immune;Immune signaling;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Knockout Mice;Link;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Molecular;Mus;Obesity;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Physiological;Play;Protein Deficiency;Psoriasis;Role;Sampling;Severities;Signal Transduction;Skin;Skin Tissue;Testing;Wild Type Mouse;adaptive immune response;chronic inflammatory skin;conditional knockout;design;diet-induced obesity;experimental study;fatty acid-binding proteins;immunoregulation;innate immune function;interleukin-23;keratinocyte;keratinocyte differentiation;link protein;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;oxidation;protein expression;response;sensor;skin disorder;treatment strategy","Immunomodulatory mechanisms of E-FABP in psoriasis pathogenesis","Project NarrativeData from this study are expected to establish E-FABP as a new player in psoriasis pathogenesis.

"Cancer; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Genetics; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTDespite therapeutic advances over 600000 people in the US will die from cancer in 2019. Preventing cancereliminates the risk of mortality and/or morbidity that may occur with the development of cancer. Thus cancerprevention represents the most effective way for addressing cancer challenges. Healthy diet is considered beessential to reduce cancer risk by maintaining and improving immunity but recent VITAL trials did not showbeneficial effects of these supplements. The negative results reflect the mechanistic knowledge gap of howdietary factors modulate health. The objectives of this renewal application are to determine cellular andmolecular mechanisms by which epithelial fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) promotes n-3 fatty acid-mediated tumor prevention by enhancing immune cell differentiation and anti-tumor activity. Data collected inthe last funding cycle have successfully established E-FABP as a new host-derived cancer prevention factor innon-obese subjects. During our studies we observed that different types of high fat diets (HFD 45% fat)including cocoa butter (rich in saturated fatty acids FAs) safflower oil (rich in 18:2 linoleic acid) fish oil (rich inn-3 FAs) all induced similar degree of obesity in mouse models. However tumor growth in these obese micewas dramatically different with the fastest growth in cocoa butter group and slowest in the fish oil group. Inanalyzing the immunophenotype of these obese mice we found an atypical population of CD8+  T cells thatwas specifically upregulated in the fish oil group. More interestingly fish oil diet-induced CD8+  Tdifferentiation and anti-tumor effects were blunted in mice lacking E-FABP suggesting a novel molecularmechanism mediated by E-FABP. Thus we hypothesized that host expression of E-FABP plays a critical rolein n-3 FA-induced immune cell differentiation and anti-tumor function. Three specific aims are proposed toaddress the central hypothesis in this renewal application. Specific Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms bywhich E-FABP promotes n-3 FA-induced immune cell differentiation. Experiments are designed to elucidatemolecular mechanisms by which consumption of dietary n-3 FAs regulate CD8+  T cell differentiation via E-FABP-dependent epigenetic reprogramming. Specific Aim 2 will delineate how E-FABP mediates n-3 FA-induced anti-tumor activity. Results of Aim 2 are expected to reveal that E-FABP promotes host anti-tumoractivity through targeting both immune cells and tumor-derived epithelial cells. Specific Aim 3 will evaluatewhether targeting E-FABP with optimized n-3 FA diets results in effective tumor prevention. In summarysuccessful completion of this proposal will offer E-FABP as a new cancer prevention target and havesignificant mechanistic and clinical implications for healthy diet-mediated cancer prevention.","Address;Animals;Basic Science;CD8B1 gene;Cell Differentiation process;Cell physiology;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Consumption;Custom;DNA;DNA methyltransferase inhibition;Data;Development;Diet;Dietary Factors;Dietary Fatty Acid;Epigenetic Process;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Fish Oils;Funding;Growth;Health;High Fat Diet;Human;Immune;Immunity;Immunologic Surveillance;Immunophenotyping;In Vitro;Interferons;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Life Style;Linoleic Acids;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Non obese;Obese Mice;Obesity;Oleic Acids;Olive oil preparation;Omega-3 Fatty Acids;Play;Population;Prevention;Production;Reactive Oxygen Species;Role;STAT3 gene;Safflower Oil;Saturated Fatty Acids;Signal Transduction;T cell differentiation;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Toxic effect;Tumor-Derived;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Vitamin D;Vitamins;World Health Organization;aldehyde dehydrogenase 1;antitumor effect;cancer prevention;cancer risk;cancer therapy;cocoa butter;conditional knockout;demethylation;design;dietary;dietary supplements;dosage;experimental study;fatty acid-binding proteins;good diet;improved;in vivo;insight;mortality risk;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;preclinical study;prevent;protein expression;response;sensor;tumor;tumor growth; T cells","E-FABP mediates n-3 fatty acid-induced tumor prevention through epigenetic control of immune cell differentiation and function","PROJECT NARRATIVEData from this study are expected to establish E-FABP as a novel molecular sensor mediating n-3 FA-inducedanti-tumor effects.

"Duchenne/ Becker Muscular Dystrophy; Muscular Dystrophy; Orphan Drug; Osteoporosis; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Women's Health","Abstract:Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a severe progressive muscular disease that affectsboth muscle and bone. To date effective therapies for DMD are limited. Studies have shownthat reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability resulted from secondary loss of neuronal nitricoxide synthase (nNOS) in the absence of dystrophin is a key contributor to disease progression.Restoring NO homeostasis via dietary nitrite and nitrate representing a novel therapeuticapproach due to its ability to be converted to NO in low oxygen and ischemic states that canbypass nNOS. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of inorganic nitrite and explore itsmechanism of action on both skeletal muscle and bone. Our preliminary data based on asevere dystrophic mouse model (dKO-dystrophin/utrophin double knock out) demonstrateddisrupted NO homeostasis in dystrophic muscle and more excitingly oral administration ofnitrite significantly improved the life span and a series of pathological changes in dystrophicmice both in skeletal muscle and bone tissues. The mechanisms underlying theseimprovements deserve further investigation to provide important preclinical and mechanisticinformation for identifying novel therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that inorganic nitriteadministration improves both muscle and bone pathologies in DMD by enhancing NO signalingpathways in dystrophic muscle and by modulating the expression and secretion of bone-regulating myokines. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1: To test thehypothesis that inorganic nitrite restores nitrate/nitrite pool in dystrophic mice and improvesmuscle/bone pathologies and preserves muscle function. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis thatnitrite affects skeletal muscle via myoglobin-mediated NO-cGMP signaling pathway. Aim 3: Totest the hypothesis that in addition to increased mechanical loading nitrite affects bonehomeostasis via modulating the expression and secretion of bone-regulating myokines fromdystrophic muscle. We anticipate that these findings will provide a novel safe and low-costtherapeutic approach benefiting both muscle and bone for the currently untreatable DMD.Completion of these aims will advance our knowledge of novel mechanisms for thepathogenesis of bone abnormalities in DMD through bone-regulating myokines as well; whichmay uncover new potential therapeutic targets. Importantly our findings may have profoundtranslational implications not only to DMD but also to other neuromuscular diseases that lacknormal NO signaling pathway function.","Affect;Anions;Arginine;Attenuated;Biological Availability;Blood;Bone Tissue;Bypass;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Clinical Trials;Cyclic GMP;Data;Dietary Nitrite;Disease;Disease Progression;Duchenne muscular dystrophy;Dystrophin;Genes;Guanosine Monophosphate;Hindlimb Suspension;Histologic;Homeostasis;Human;Hypoxia;Intervention;Investigation;Knock-out;Knowledge;Liver;Longevity;Measures;Mediating;Molecular;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Muscle Fibers;Muscle function;Muscular Dystrophies;Musculoskeletal;Mutation;Myocardium;Myoglobin;Myopathy;Neuromuscular Diseases;Nitrates;Nitric Oxide;Nitric Oxide Pathway;Nitric Oxide Signaling Pathway;Nitric Oxide Synthase;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I;Nitrites;Nitrogen Dioxide;Oral;Oral Administration;Organ Culture Techniques;Osteoporosis;Outcome;Oxygen;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Periodicity;Pharmacology;Physiological;Production;Recombinant Fibroblast Growth Factor;Role;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Skeletal Muscle;Skeletal bone;Source;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Tissues;Utrophin;base;bone;bone cell;bone loss;bone quality;comorbidity;cost;cost effective;cranium;curative treatments;dietary nitrate;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;efficacy study;efficacy testing;fibroblast growth factor 21;gain of function;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;mechanical load;mouse model;neuron loss;neutralizing antibody;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;phosphoric diester hydrolase;potential biomarker;pre-clinical;preservation;skeletal muscle differentiation;therapeutic target;therapeutically effective","Targeting Nitrate-Nitrite-NO pathway for Ameliorating Muscle and Bone Comorbidities in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy","Project NarrativeThe purpose of this project is to evaluate the efficacy and study the mechanisms of its actions oforal nitrite administration as a novel therapeutic approach to replenish NO in dystrophic muscleby targeting nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway which is significantly disturbed in DMD.

Given that an average of 35% of ever-married women in India haveexperienced IPV and its many public health sequelae it is critical to understand the attitudes held by boysgirls men and women that may contribute to IPV. The University of Iowa (Department of Community andBehavioral Health) is collaborating with the Saint Johns Medical College (Department of Community Health) inBangalore to generate evidence about IPV and develop male-focused strategies to reduce IPV in Indias peri-urban settings. The collaboration is addressing the urgent need to work with early adolescent boys their malerole models to reshape ideologies about gender roles and masculinity.Focusing on two peri-urban catchment areas in southeast Bangalore district the two-year mixed-methodproject will 1) assess attitudes and behaviors related to gender roles masculinity social capital and violenceagainst women among couples; 2) explore the attitudes of boys girls men and women related to gendernorms; and 3) build the institutional capacity of Saint John's Medical College to address violence againstwomen in their research and medical training. The University of Iowa and St. Johns Medical College will usethe findings from the two-year project to develop and test an intervention focused on transforming gendernorms and reducing violence against women by working with boys and male role models.For Specific Aim 1 we will use qualitative methods to cognitively validate a survey instrument using existingmeasures for gender roles masculinity social capital and violence against women including items from theDemographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Gender Equitable Men (GEM) scale. We will then randomlysample 528 couples (ages 18-49) and administer the new quantitative survey simultaneously and separately tomen and women. For Specific Aim 2 we will use qualitative methods to elucidate our findings from thequantitative survey with a focus on the relationship between gender norms and IPV. We will focus on men andwomen (ages 18-49) and boys and girls (ages 10-14) by conducting 60 in-depth interviews and 12 focusgroup discussions to explore gender norms and identify male role models.

"Digestive Diseases; Neurosciences","SummaryNormal motor activity in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract relies upon coordinated contractions of the smooth musclecells (SMCs) that line its walls. The ultimate contractile behavior of GI muscles depends upon the state of SMCexcitability when regulatory inputs (e.g. nerve reflexes hormones etc) are applied. This project has developedthe concept of the SIP syncytium an electrically coupled tissue consisting of SMCs interstitial cells of Cajal andPDGFRa+ cells that establishes the basal excitability of smooth muscles organizes contractile behavior intophasic contractions and transduces signals from a variety of motor neurons. GI motility in fact results from theintegrated output of the SIP syncytium. During the past funding period we discovered that PDGFRa+ cells are anovel class of regulatory cells and essential component of the SIP syncytium. These cells express receptorsand ion channels consistent with mediation of purinergic inhibitory regulation in the GI tract. Through isolationand purification of PDGFRa+ cells by FACS we performed deep sequencing to better understand the phenotypesof these cells. The expression data suggest that many additional pathways such as adrenergic and inhibitoryneuropeptides contribute to the regulatory functions of PDGFRa+ cells. The focus of the upcoming fundingperiod is to test the hypothesis that sympathetic nerve and enteric inhibitory neuropeptide signals are alsotransduced by PDGFRa+ cells making these cells a convergent central integrator of inhibitory regulation ofcolonic motility. We will first clarify the tissue level responses mediated by sympathetic neurotransmission andinhibitory neuropeptides that can be attributed to mechanisms expressed uniquely by PDGFRa+ cells.Preliminary data clearly show direct sympathetic innervation and inhibitory effects of PDGFRa+ cells powerfulenough to halt propulsive contractions in the colon. This is an exciting new concept of how stressful conditionsmight radically alter bowel habits through PDGFRa+ cells. Our findings suggest that any stimulus coupled toCa2+ transients in PDGFRa+ cells will activate small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels and initiatepowerful hyperpolarization and inhibitory influences on the SIP syncytium. We will use cutting edge Ca2+ imagingtechniques including cell-specific optogenetic sensors to better understand the cells and sequence of eventsthat occurs in peptidergic and sympathetic inhibitory responses mediated by PDGFRa+ cells. Finally in studiesof single cells we will utilize electrophysiological and imaging techniques to expand our knowledge of ionicconductances that might be used by PDGFRa+ cells to generate integrated inhibitory regulation. We will alsostudy the role of Ca2+ stores in the responses and how stores are maintained for long term and repetitiveinhibitory responses. Completion of the specific aims will provide novel information about an important cell typenever been considered a regulatory factor in GI motility. Knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms contributedby PDGFRa+ cells will provide new understanding about factors that generate normal colonic possibly discovernew methods for therapeutic management of motility disorders.OMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018) Page Continuation Format Page","Adrenergic Agents;Adverse effects;Behavior;Biology;Calcium-Activated Potassium Channel;Catecholamines;Cell Line;Cells;Colon;Confocal Microscopy;Constipation;Coupled;Data;Defect;Diarrhea;Electrophysiology (science);Enteral;Enteric Nervous System;Event;Fertilization;Functional disorder;Funding;Gap Junctions;Gastrointestinal Motility;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Giant Cells;Habits;Hormonal;Hormones;Human;Imaging Techniques;In Situ;Inflammation;Interstitial Cell of Cajal;Intestines;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Mediating;Mediation;Methods;Molecular Target;Motor;Motor Activity;Motor Neurons;Movement;Mus;Muscle;Myenteric Plexus;Nerve;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Neurotransmitters;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Outcome;Output;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phase;Phenotype;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha Receptor;Population;Progress Reports;Reagent;Reflex action;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Research;Role;Signal Transduction;Small Intestines;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stimulus;Stretching;Structure;Sympathetic Nervous System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Urinary tract;Varicosity;Work;body system;cell motility;cell type;confocal imaging;deep sequencing;effective therapy;gastrointestinal;genome-wide;insight;interstitial cell;macrophage;motility disorder;motor control;motor disorder;nerve supply;neurotransmission;novel;optogenetics;paracrine;receptor;relating to nervous system;reproductive tract;response;sensor;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;wasting","Inhibitory mechanisms of PDGFRa+ interstitial cells in gastrointestinal motility","Project NarrativeIntrinsic and extrinsic nerves organize appropriate movements of the GI tract.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Emergency Care; Health Services; Hematology; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Sepsis; Social Determinants of Health","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTPediatric sepsis affects over 50000 U.S. children each year resulting in long-term functional disability andhigher risk of mortality at a cost of nearly $2 billion. Early recognition and resuscitation of pediatric sepsis canreduce mortality and improve outcomes. However current adherence to early resuscitation guidelines remainslow among pediatric sepsis and septic shock patients. Adherence to pediatric sepsis care guidelines is worsethan in the adult sepsis population especially in low-volume facilities. Compared to adults pediatric sepsispatients may be at higher risk of disparate incidence and outcomes given sparser access to definitive pediatrichospital care. The central hypothesis of this study is that increased pediatric sepsis mortality can be partiallyattributed to geographic access and facility-level characteristics among patients with similar severities ofillness. This study will use multi-state all-payer administrative claims data and a national readiness survey ofemergency departments (EDs) to test the central hypothesis with the following aims: (1) identify facility-levelcharacteristics associated with effective pediatric sepsis care and (2) determine the role of access to care inpediatric sepsis outcomes. The proposed work will provide a foundation of evidence to inform the developmentof pediatric sepsis quality improvement programs and systems for pediatric populations with decreased accessto childrens hospitals. This research training project will equip Morgan Swanson (Principal Investigator) withthe research experience advanced critical thinking skills and technical knowledge to succeed as anindependent investigator. As a future physician-scientist this project will provide Ms. Swanson withfoundational skills to develop a research career focused on minimizing the burden of pediatric critical illnessthrough improving emergency health care access and delivery.","Accident and Emergency department;Acute;Adherence;Adult;Affect;Antibiotics;Blood;Bolus Infusion;Caring;Censuses;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Communities;Critical Illness;Critical Thinking;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Education;Emergency Care;Equipment;Equipment and Supplies;Fellowship;Foundational Skills;Foundations;Future;Geographic Factor;Geography;Goals;Guidelines;Health Services Accessibility;Health Services Research;Healthcare Systems;Hospital Departments;Hospital Mortality;Hospitals;Hour;IV Fluid;Improve Access;Incidence;Investigation;Knowledge;Link;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Medically Underserved Area;Morbidity - disease rate;Neighborhoods;New York;Outcome;Outcome Study;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pediatric Intensive Care Units;Physicians;Policies;Population;Principal Investigator;Protocols documentation;Readiness;Research;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resuscitation;Risk;Role;Scientist;Sepsis;Septic Shock;Severity of illness;Specialist;Stroke;Subgroup;Surveys;System;Testing;Time;Training;Trauma;Triage;Variant;Visit;Work;acute care;cancer diagnosis;care costs;care delivery;care outcomes;care systems;career;cohort;cost;disability risk;experience;functional disability;health care availability;high risk;high risk population;improved;improved outcome;mortality;mortality risk;pediatric emergency;pediatric patients;programs;public health intervention;septic patients;skills;social health determinants;training project;young adult","The Role of Neighborhood- and Facility-Level Factors in Pediatric Sepsis Mortality","PROJECT NARRATIVESepsis has a large morbidity and mortality burden among U.S. children and variation in recognition and initialsepsis care may represent an opportunity to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Rare Diseases","SUMMARYMutations that render the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) defective in functionlead to cystic fibrosis a devastating multisystem disease affecting tens of thousands of people worldwide.Drug discovery efforts by Vertex Inc. (Cambridge Mass. USA) have yielded clinically efficacious drugcombinations establishing CFTR as a therapeutically accessible target. Thus far all of the successfully testedtherapies include Ivacaftor which as a potentiator rather than an activator of CFTR relies at least to somedegree on the phosphorylation state of CFTR which is subject to dynamic hormonal regulation in vivo. Inaddition accumulating evidence suggests that Ivacaftor works through an ATP-independent mechanismmeaning that the canonical route by which stable CFTR openings are achieved namely ATP-drivendimerization of the intracellular binding domains is not exploited by Ivacaftor. By aiming to better understandboth phospho regulation and ATP binding in CFTR the two aims of this proposal are expected to supportfuture efforts to develop mechanism-based therapies that increase CFTR function. Two scientific aims in myproposal describe the means to achieve these goals. The first of these aims will use a powerful method wehave developed whereby the phosphorylation state of a specific site in the CFTR channel is controlled by abrief (<1 second) flash of light. This will allow me to observe the intrinsic phosphorylation rates of the channeland the functional consequence in real time in a cellular environment. Given that phosphoregulation of ionchannels is well-described in the lung and heart and often defective in cardiovascular disease this trainingand the anticipated ensuing discoveries will likely lead directly to additional opportunities on other ion channelproteins with ties to human health. The second aim will examine the interaction chemistry that is utilizedbetween nucleotide binding domains (NBD) and ATP their regulatory target. NBDs are ancient domains(billions of years old) that are found throughout biology thus advancing their mode of action will simultaneouslyimpact multiple areas. I will use structural biology and advanced spectroscopic methods to examine themechanism of how the soluble NBDs from the CFTR channel bind to their regulatory target ATP. The likelycommon output from these combined efforts will be the publication of multiple high value papers and theadvanced training in modern techniques for the study of ion channel proteins. Additionally CFTRs evolutionallows it to serve as a model for both phospho-regulation of ion channels (in common with many other clinicallyrelevant channels in the lung and heart) and for ATP-based activation of other ABC transporters which playimportant roles in lung physiology.

"Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Patient Safety","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe transition from acute to chronic pain has eluded researchers for years likely due to its complex nature andthe inherent individual variability. The ability to identify individuals at risk and those with reduced risk for thetransition to chronic pain using biomarkers will advance personalized acute pain treatment strategies reducereliance on opioid pharmacotherapy and help identify novel therapeutic targets thereby transforming themanagement of acute pain events. The Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program aims to identifybiomarkers and their collective biosignatures (a combination of several individual biomarkers) that predictsusceptibility or resilience to the development of chronic pain after an acute pain event through thedevelopment of a large consortium. The advantage of multisite observational studies is their ability tocomprehensively phenotype large population cohorts across multiple biopsychosocial domains in a relativelyshort time. This application describes a partnership between a strong group of pain scientists (Sluka FreyLaw) and the Clinical Trials Statistical and Data Management Center (Coffey Ecklund) at the University ofIowa. The proposed CCC applies thorough and well-organized principles to facilitate support and enhance thescientific rigor and effectiveness of key stakeholders for the identification of critical biomarkers for the acute tochronic pain transition using the following task-based specific aims: 1) Lead the development andimplementation of clinical protocols. 2) Provide oversight and management of collaborative activities across theconsortium to support the overall goals of A2CPS. And 3) Facilitate transparent and effective communicationbetween consortium members. The CCC will support study design bringing expertise in pain and adaptivedesigns to help identify biomarkers for study inclusion; promote efficiency and quality through development ofmilestones Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) individualized recruitment plans and staff trainingprotocols. The CCC will be responsible for regulatory procedures including: standardizing the electronic healthrecord; coordinating a central Institutional Review Board (cIRB); and convening a Data Safety and MonitoringBoard (DSMB). The CCC will track protocol quality control procedures and safety monitoring; perform centralmonitoring and on-site monitoring visits; and monitor progress towards A2CPS milestones particularly site-specific enrollment and retention targets a critical component in the success of the A2CPS initiative. Thesuccess of the A2CPS Program is dependent on effective management and coordination of activities acrossthe Consortium. We have assembled a team with expertise spanning pain science clinical trials in patientswith pain and other conditions and successful large multi-site trial coordination. The University of Iowa has ahighly collaborative environment with strong pain science researchers making us well prepared to successfullyperform the many needed roles of the A2CPS Clinical Coordination Center.","Acute;Acute Pain;Acute pain management;Animals;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Clinical Trials Network;Communication;Complex;Development;Effectiveness;Electronic Health Record;Electronic Mail;Enrollment;Event;Future;Goals;Human;Image;Individual;Institutional Review Boards;Iowa;Islets of Langerhans Transplantation;Laws;Lead;Leadership;Logistics;Monitor;Musculoskeletal Pain;Nature;Observational Study;Opioid;Pain;Pain management;Parkinson Disease;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Persons;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population;Positioning Attribute;Postoperative Pain;Predisposition;Procedures;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Sampling Studies;Science;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Scientist;Sensory;Site;Site Visit;Spinal Muscular Atrophy;Standardization;Techniques;Teleconferences;Testing;Time;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Update;Visit;base;biopsychosocial;biopsychosocial factor;biosignature;candidate marker;chronic pain;clinical implementation;cohort;collaborative environment;data management;design;experience;high throughput screening;individual variation;meetings;member;multi-site trial;new therapeutic target;opioid abuse;pain chronification;prevent;procedure safety;programs;progression marker;psychologic;recruit;resilience;success;symposium;synuclein;tool;translational clinical trial;treatment strategy;virtual","Clinical Coordinating Center for the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures Program","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program aims to identify biomarkers and their collectivebiosignatures (a combination of several individual biomarkers) that predict susceptibility or resilience to thedevelopment of chronic pain after an acute pain event through the development of a large consortium.

Adolescents especially girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV. Inwestern Kenya over 50% of adolescents had sexual intercourse before the age of 18; however youth betweenthe ages of 15-19 have low rates of condom use and HIV testing. Stigma negatively affects HIV preventionbehaviors including condom use and HIV testing. In Kenya complex interactions between social capitalreligiosity and gender norms shape societies discriminating attitudes towards youth perceived to be infectedwith HIV (i.e. HIV-related stigma) which in turn affects HIV prevention. Our parent award aims to study therelationship between social capital religiosity gender norms and HIV-related stigma among adolescents(ages 15-19) and its impact on HIV prevention in western Kenya.With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic the Kenyan government enacted mitigation strategies includinglockdowns. Although these policies are important to limit the spread of COVID-19 they have many unintendedconsequences among adolescents such as increased risk of HIV. Additionally people living with HIV haveincreased psychosocial burdens emanating from stress isolation and stigma due to COVID-19. Theseoutcomes are compounded by a lack of social relationships especially among youth. Therefore thissupplement will use a mixed-methods approach to assess the effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures onchanges in social relationships (i.e. social capital religiosity gender norms) stigma and HIV preventionamong youth in western Kenya by addressing the following specific aims: (1) Examine trends in social capitalreligiosity gender norms stigma and HIV preventive behaviors before and after the COVID-19 lockdownamong adolescents in western Kenya; and (2) Elucidate the drivers of change in social relationships theexperience of stigma and the changes in HIV preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown in westernKenya. In Aim 1 we will employ two surveys to explore social relationships stigma and HIV prevention among765 boys and girls ages 15-19 years. The two surveys will ask youth to recall their experiences andperceptions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Aim 2 we will conduct 18 focus groups discussionswith boys and girls ages 15-19 years healthcare providers parents teachers and religious leaders to exploretheir perceptions of how COVID-19 has changed the lives of young people especially youth living with HIV.This supplement will illuminate the unintended consequences of COVID-19 disease control efforts in relation toHIV preventive behaviors among adolescents in Kenya. Additionally this study will extend research capacity atTangaza University College and Gynocare Womens and Fistulas Hospital around studying the intersectionbetween COVID-19 disease control efforts stigma and HIV prevention in Kenya.","2019-nCoV;AIDS prevention;AIDS/HIV problem;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Address;Adolescent;Affect;Age;Attitude;Award;Behavior;Belief;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;Cause of Death;Coitus;Communities;Complex;Data;Discrimination;Disease;Epidemic;Exposure to;Face;Fistula;Focus Groups;Gender;Gender Role;Government;HIV;Health Personnel;Hospitals;Human immunodeficiency virus test;Kenya;Life;Marriage;Measures;Mental Health;Methods;Outcome;Parents;Perception;Persons;Policies;Pregnancy in Adolescence;Prevalence;Preventive;Public Health;Religion and Spirituality;Research;Research Priority;Resources;Risk;SARS-CoV-2 infection;Schools;Shapes;Social Behavior;Social Network;Societies;Stress;Structure;Surveys;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Unsafe Sex;Woman;Youth;base;boys;college;condom use rate;condoms;disorder control;experience;gender disparity;girls;high risk;negative affect;peer support;prevent;psychosocial;social;social capital;social relationships;social stigma;support network;teacher;trend","Building Capacity to Study the Intersection Between COVID-19 and HIV-Related Stigma among Adolescents in Western Kenya","Project NarrativeAdolescents especially girls are vulnerable to HIV in Kenya where stigma and discrimination present animportant challenge to HIV prevention.

Other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV are thought to gain entry to the brain via the olfactory bulb andquickly spread to interconnected regions such as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) which is a major source ofserotonin (5-HT) neurons in the brain that orchestrates neurological functions ranging from autonomic control toemotional and motivated behavior. Alcohol is also known to compromise the function of 5-HT neurons in thebrain and may render them more vulnerable to infection by SARS-CoV2 exacerbating the neuropsychiatricsequelae of this disease. The goal of the present application is to determine whether alcohol can increaseexpression of known entry factors for SARS-CoV2 in DRN 5-HT neurons and facilitate infection of these neurons.In Aim 1 we will determine whether chronic intermittent alcohol exposure upregulates expression of entry factorsACE2 and TMPRSS2 in 5-HT DRN neurons that project to the olfactory bulb using retrograde tracers. In Aim 2we will determine whether SARS-CoV2 can infect 5-HT DRN neurons via the olfactory bulb and whether chronicintermittent alcohol exacerbates infection and death of these neurons. Together these studies will revealwhether alcohol is a significant risk factor for SARS-CoV2 invasion of the CNS and whether the DRN 5-HTsystems is a target for this infection.","Air;Alcohol abuse;Alcohol consumption;Alcohol dependence;Alcohol withdrawal syndrome;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Anxiety;Automobile Driving;Bathing;Behavior;Chronic;Coupled;Data;Dependence;Dopamine;Dynorphins;Electrophysiology (science);Ethanol;Ethanol dependence;Exposure to;Frequencies;Goals;Heavy Drinking;Hyperactivity;Infusion procedures;Investigation;Left;Membrane;Messenger RNA;Microdialysis;Mus;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Opioid Antagonist;Opioid agonist;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pharmacology Study;Population;Proteins;Public Health;Receptor Signaling;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Rewards;Role;Serotonin;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Slice;Techniques;Testing;Tracer;Training;Up-Regulation;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol exposure;alcohol seeking behavior;alcohol use disorder;base;career;design;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;drinking;drinking behavior;experimental study;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;kappa opioid receptors;motivated behavior;neural circuit;neuroadaptation;optogenetics;public health relevance;response","The role of serotonin signaling in the nucleus accumbens in excessive alcohol drinking","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis project will elucidate the role of alcohol in neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV2.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Women's Health","AbstractThe Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center (HCCC) and the Iowa Cancer Consortium (ICC)have a highly collaborative relationship and actively engage communities to address canceroutcomes in Iowa. Nevertheless there continues to be a need to enhance efforts focused on thecommunities with the most significant cancer disparities. Data from the Iowa Cancer Registryindicate that cancer disparities in Iowa are greatest between the Black/African Americanpopulation and Whites and Iowa has the second highest cancer mortality among the Blackpopulation of all 50 states. As a long-standing successful state-wide coalition ICC hasextensive expertise in facilitation and relationship building. ICC also has connections withpartners across the state in Black/African American communities. ICC does not have theresources or expertise to help these partners identify community needs or implementinterventions to address the needs. The HCCC COE team can address these gaps by providingexpertise in data collection analysis and interpretation of community needs assessmentsincluding access to the Iowa Cancer Registry data. HCCC COE also has extensive experiencein community-engaged research to address community cancer needs. HCCC COE hassuccessfully identified appropriate evidence-based interventions to align with community needsadapted these interventions to fit the community and conducted process and outcomeevaluations in collaboration with community partners. The combined expertise and experienceof HCCC COE and ICC will be used to accomplish the following aims: 1) to strengthen therelationship between HCCC and ICC by testing a process to engage Black/African Americancommunities in Iowa in identifying cancer related community needs and 2) to address cancerrelated community needs in Black/African American communities in Iowa by matching evidence-based interventions with community-identified needs then adapting implementing andevaluating these interventions. The outcome of achieving these aims will be 1) a stronger moreproductive relationship between HCCC and ICC 2) improved connections between HCCC andthe Black/African American communities 3) a proven-effective process for engagingBlack/African American communities in Iowa 4) the implementation of evidence-basedinterventions to address significant cancer disparities in Iowa and 5) the sustained engagementwith the Black/African American community through ICC.","Address;African American;Attention;Collaborations;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Data;Data Collection;Disadvantaged;Evaluation;Evidence based intervention;Family;Foundations;Intervention;Iowa;Iowan;Malignant Neoplasms;Nature;Needs Assessment;Outcome;Population;Process;Relationship-Building;Resources;Structural Racism;Testing;cancer health disparity;community engaged research;community engagement;data registry;design;experience;improved;interest;mortality;neoplasm registry","Partnering to reach communities with Iowas largest cancer disparities","Project NarrativeThis project is designed to strengthen the relationship between the Iowa Cancer Consortiumand the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center by collaborating to engage the Black/AfricanAmerican community in Waterloo Iowa.

"Bioengineering; Regenerative Medicine","Project Summary/AbstractLarge animal models are critically needed to develop regenerative medicine therapeutics and maximize safe translationto the clinic as the FDA recommends data be provided on both small and large animal models for approval of suchtherapies. Using R24 funding (OD019813) we developed biocontainment facilities and protocols to raise an Artemis(DCLRE1C) mutant SCID pig model (ART) as well as an improved model also mutant in IL2RG (ART-IL2RG). The use of SCIDpig models in preclinical research necessitates the ability to safely ship healthy SCID pigs across the United States tointerested scientists who do not have the ability to raise such pigs themselves. The following two Aims address thisexisting deficit in the SCID pig research field:Aim 1. Create methods to safely transport SCID pigs within a HEPA filtered isolator transported in a HEPA filteredtrailer to researchers in the US and CanadaAim 2. Improve the biosecurity and health of SCID pigs by creating a shower-in facility and purchase dedicatedsterilization equipment.As there is no established method to ship SCID pigs while maintaining biocontainment work in Aim 1 will focus ondevelopment of a transportation system consisting of a customized trailer and internal isolators will make this criticalnext step possible. The transportable internal isolators are needed both to safely house the SCID pigs as well as short-distance transportation from facility biocontainment bubbles to the sterilized trailer for long-distance transport.Further this revised plan expands the type of clientele who can use the SCID pig as the isolators containing the SCID pigcan be maintained at an external site for short-term research studies. In Aim 2 we continue to develop effectiveprotocols for SCID pig rearing and have identified that isolators are a useful adjunct to the originally proposed andvalidated bubble procedures. Biosecurity of the SCID pigs will be dramatically improved by the addition of a shower-infacility and purchase of dedicated hydrogen peroxide vaporizer adequately sized for sterilizing these new spaces andequipment. We propose to use A&R funds to renovate unused space adjacent to the existing biocontainment bubbles toprovide this shower-in facility and raise the level of biosecurity for SCID pig housing to the industry standard. Thesterilization equipment consisting of a dedicated hydrogen peroxide vaporizer capable of handling the existing bubblesand the proposed new transportation approach in Aim 1 is critically needed as existing equipment is inadequate. Theproposed Supplemental Aims do not expand the scope of the existing parent grant and are directly responsive to the callfor A&R supplements.","Address;Age;Animal Model;Animals;Canada;Cells;Client;Clinic;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Custom;Data;Development;Disease;Equipment;Family suidae;Funding;Future;Generations;Goals;Health;Hematopoiesis;Housing;Human;Human Biology;Hydrogen Peroxide;IL2RG gene;Immune;Industry;Industry Standard;Institution;Knowledge;Location;Methods;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibody R24;Mus;Neonatal;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Procedures;Protocols documentation;Recording of previous events;Regenerative Medicine;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Scientist;Ships;Site;Sterility;Sterilization;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translations;Transportation;United States;Vaporizer;Work;Xenograft procedure;artemis;biocontainment facility;biosecurity;design;experience;high efficiency particulate air filter;human model;improved;interest;method development;mutant;novel;parent grant;porcine model;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;pregnant;research study;safety study;stem cell therapy;stem cells;translational model;transplant model","Developing second generation SCID pig models: filling the gaps to improve translation of therapeutics in regenerative medicine","Project NarrativeThe use of SCID pig models in preclinical regenerative medicine research necessitates the ability tosafely ship healthy SCID pigs across the United States for use by interested scientists.

"Biotechnology; Chronic Pain; Neurosciences; Opioids; Pain Research","ABSTRACTChronic pain is a major concern in public health with financial costs projected to surmount $600 billon in thenext year. Patients afflicted with chronic pain endure extreme emotional physical and social burdensresulting in severely diminished quality of life. Unfortunately drugs currently used for chronic painmanagement such as NSAIDs opioids neuronal stabilizers and antidepressants do not typically providesufficient relief to restore full quality of life and in many instances these treatments themselves limitpatients such as opioid treatment preventing a patient from legally driving. Recent preclinical studies haveidentified neuronal adenylyl cyclase type 1 (AC1) as a novel target for treating chronic pain. AC1 is highlyexpressed in neuronal tissues associated with pain processing and neuronal plasticity and studies usingAC1 knockout mice provide direct evidence linking AC1 to chronic inflammatory pain conditions.Furthermore AC1 inhibitors would lack the side effects associated with other agents (e.g. opioids) used totreat chronic inflammatory pain. The development of AC1 inhibitors represents a unique challenge asdemonstrated by a prior preclinical AC1 inhibitor NB001. NB001 has significant shortcomings includingmodest selectivity over other adenylyl cyclase isoforms likely due to its adenine-like structure. Compoundsof this type are called P-site inhibitors and act by binding to the active site of AC that is conserved among allisoforms. Additional concerns for adenine-containing molecules like NB001 include effects on other cellularprocesses such as DNA synthesis. We hypothesize that developing a small molecule inhibitor of AC1 willallow us to mimic the AC1 knockout phenotype and provide a new avenue for the treatment of chronicinflammatory pain. We designed our studies to target NOT the conserved P-site or forskolin-binding site butrather a novel approach targeting the unique protein-protein interaction of AC1 and calmodulin (CaM). AC1and AC8 are both activated by CaM however the CaM binding domains are unique in structure andlocation providing an unprecedented opportunity to achieve AC1 selectivity. Thus the goals of this proposalare to: 1) develop a novel AC1/CaM biochemical screening assay 2) implement this novel assay in a highthroughput screen to interrogate a library of 100000 compounds for inhibitors of the AC1/CaM protein-protein interaction and 3) validate and chemically optimize lead molecules using cellular assays focused onselectivity and potency to guide medicinal chemistry efforts. To date we have completed initial studies todevelop the novel screening assay established a subset of the necessary assays and cemented thecollaboration between the University of Iowa and Purdue University for the successful completion of ouraims. We anticipate the identification of selective AC1 inhibitors that ultimately be improved and applied inmodels of chronic inflammatory pain.","Active Sites;Adenine;Adenylate Cyclase;Antidepressive Agents;Arthritis;Automobile Driving;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Calcium;Calmodulin;Calmodulin 1;Catalogs;Cell membrane;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Assay;Chelating Agents;Chemicals;Chronic inflammatory pain;Chronic low back pain;Collaborations;Complex;DNA biosynthesis;Data;Development;Drug Industry;Economic Burden;Egtazic Acid;Emotional;Financial cost;Fluorescence Polarization;Forskolin;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits Gs;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genetic study;Goals;Health;Iowa;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Legal;Libraries;Link;Location;Modeling;Mus;Neurobiology;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;New Agents;Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Pain;Patients;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Protein Isoforms;Public Health;Quality of life;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Specificity;Stimulus;Structure;Therapeutic;Tissues;Universities;War;addiction;adenylyl cyclase 1;base;cancer pain;cheminformatics;chronic pain;chronic pain management;chronic painful condition;complement C2b;cost;cyanine dye 5;design;high throughput screening;improved;in vitro Model;in vivo;inflammatory pain;inhibitor/antagonist;knockout animal;lead optimization;new therapeutic target;non-opioid analgesic;novel;novel strategies;opioid epidemic;opioid use;pain processing;pre-clinical;preclinical study;prevent;protein protein interaction;scaffold;screening;side effect;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;social;synthetic peptide","Non-opioids for inflammatory pain: Adenylyl cyclase 1 as a novel target","Project NarrativeThis proposal focuses on the development of a high throughput screen and subsequentcharacterization and medicinal chemistry of newly discovered molecules that act as inhibitors ofthe adenylyl cyclase 1 and calmodulin protein-protein interaction that may provide a newavenue of treatment for chronic inflammatory pain.

"Biotechnology; Health Disparities; Infectious Diseases; Minority Health; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Women's Health","Project SummaryChlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) is the leading cause of non-congenital blindness and the most prevalent sexuallytransmitted bacterial infection in the world and thus has a major impact on global health. C.t. replicates in amembrane-bound vacuole termed the inclusion that is extensively modified early in infection through theincorporation of over 50 type III secreted effector proteins termed inclusion membrane proteins (Incs). Fromwithin the confines of the inclusion the bacterium must engage select host organelles to obtain key nutrientssuch as lipids and iron for bacterial replication and inclusion expansion. Despite the importance of nutrientacquisition to chlamydial infection a major gap in our knowledge exists regarding how C.t. acquires theseessential substrates from the host cell. Recent work from our group shows that the Inc protein CT229 binds andrecruits Rab GTPases and specific Rab effectors to the inclusion. Using cutting-edge genetics we showed thatthe absence of CT229 results in defects in intracellular replication and inclusion development. We hypothesizethat CT229-Rab interactions direct post-Golgi vesicles and recycling endosomes to the inclusion for theacquisition of essential substrates needed for proliferation and inclusion expansion. In Aim 1 we will determinehow CT229-Rab interactions promote lipid acquisition by hijacking host vesicular trafficking pathways and ironacquisition by promoting the recruitment of transferrin-positive vesicles to the inclusion. We will evaluate the lipidcomposition of the bacterial and inclusion membranes and evaluate the importance of lipid acquisition forincorporation into the inclusion and bacterial membranes. We will also answer a major long-standing question inthe field by determining whether transferrin indeed serves as a major source of iron for chlamydia andfurthermore mechanistically probe the mechanisms by which chlamydia may extract iron from this pathway. It isunlikely that CT229 alone controls vesicle hijacking from start to finish therefore in Aim 2 we will identify thecomplex of host and bacterial proteins that are formed at the inclusion during CT229-Rab interactions. Usingcellular genetic and molecular techniques we will evaluate the impact of Inc-Inc interactions on Rab-dependentvesicle transport to the inclusion.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Health Disparities; Minority Health; Neurosciences; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Substance Misuse","Relapse to heroin use remains a significant challenge in the treatment of heroin addiction yet ourunderstanding of those neural systems that enable individuals to inhibit heroin seeking and relapse remainspoor. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the neural circuits and the changes in those circuits thatunderlie the inhibition of heroin-seeking behavior using rat models of heroin seeking. Previous work withcocaine seeking has suggested that the infralimbic cortex is involved in the extinction and inhibition of cocaineseeking. Yet the role of this prefrontal region in opioid seeking has been unclear as studies have producedfindings indicating that the infralimbic promotes and inhibits opioid seeking. As increasing evidence suggeststhat different projections from prefrontal regions can mediate distinct functions we have hypothesized that theability of the infralimbic to either promote or inhibit heroin seeking is related to the specific projections from thisregion to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAshell) vs. the amygdala. In addition we have recently developedpreliminary data suggesting that the anterior portion of the insular cortex (rostral agranular insular cortexRAIC) inhibits heroin seeking. However other studies with other drugs of abuse indicate that the RAIC alsoappears to promote drug-seeking behavior. Thus it seems likely that as with the IL the key to understandingthe role of the RAIC in heroin seeking depends on targeting different projections. Indeed like the infralimbicthe RAIC projects to the amygdala a region that prior studies have found to be involved in promotingreinstatement to heroin seeking. However the RAIC also provides an input to the infralimbic itself thusproviding a mechanism for how the RAIC may influence and interact with the infralimbic during the extinctionand inhibition of heroin seeking. The proposed studies therefore will examine these circuits during heroinseeking and will include approaches that have not to our knowledge been used in studies of heroin seeking.In particular our studies will examine the neurophysiological correlates of heroin seeking in the RAIC and ILvia ensemble recordings in both regions simultaneously. The findings from this work will likely reveal neuronalsubpopulations in both regions related to the extinction and/or inhibition of heroin seeking. Moreover ourproposed work will use optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations of the specific projections from theinfralimbic to the NAshell and amygdala and from the RAIC to the infralimbic cortex and amygdala. Specificallythese manipulations will allow us to interrogate the role of each pathway in the encoding of the extinctionlearning and the reinstatement of heroin seeking. As a result this proposal will provide converging lines ofevidence regarding this circuitry and the inhibition of heroin seeking. The findings from the studies will furnishcritical new basic knowledge of the neural systems underlying the suppression of heroin seeking that willpotentially lead to the development of more effective treatments that strengthen such systems in heroin-addicted individuals.","Address;Amygdaloid structure;Anterior;Behavior;Behavior Control;Behavioral Paradigm;Brain region;Cocaine;Complex;Conflict (Psychology);Consumption;Custom;Data;Development;Electrophysiology (science);Epidemic;Extinction (Psychology);Face;Foundations;Future;Goals;Heroin;Heroin Dependence;Heterogeneity;Impairment;Implant;Individual;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Mediating;Modeling;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Output;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prefrontal Cortex;Rattus;Relapse;Research;Rodent;Rodent Model;Role;Self Administration;Site;Structure;System;Testing;Training;United States;Veins;Work;base;design;drug of abuse;drug seeking behavior;effective therapy;experimental study;heroin use;learning extinction;multi-electrode arrays;neural circuit;neurophysiology;optogenetics;programs;public health relevance;relating to nervous system","Neural systems controlling the inhibition of heroin seeking ","Public health relevance: Opioid addiction has grown into a major epidemic in the United Statesas individuals addicted to opioids including heroin face great difficulty in suppressing their driveto consume the drug even long after their previous use of their drug.

"Genetics; Human Genome","Maintaining genetic stability is of paramount importance for the survival of cells and organisms. Double-strandDNA breaks (DSBs) are the most lethal DNA lesion threatening genomic stability and cells have evolved avariety of mechanisms for their repair. While some of the repair mechanisms are accurate others are riskyand can further destabilize the genome leading to cancer and other diseases in humans. The molecularevents that draw the intermediates of otherwise accurate repair pathways into a maelstrom of destabilizingDNA repair mechanisms where these intermediates are then processed through risky DNA repair pathwaysremain unexplored. The goal of our research is to understand how DSB repair is channeled into the deleteriousrepair pathways with particular emphasis on three DSB repair phenomena: 1) break-induced replication (BIR)an unusual type of long-tract repair DNA synthesis that promotes bursts of genetic instabilities; 2)microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) a replicative pathway involving multiple template switching events atpositions of microhomologies that yields complex genomic rearrangements; and 3) the transformation of longsingle-strand DNA intermediates of DSB repair into toxic joint molecules promoting cell death. As a startingpoint we are using our dependable and powerful system in yeast where a single DSB is initiated by a site-specific HO endonuclease; we have demonstrated that all three of the repair events of interest can be used torepair the lesion in this system. The knowledge obtained using this system  the repair mechanismsintermediates participating proteins and mutation patterns  is used to inform the experimental design ofstudies that will evaluate these pathways in other yeast and mammalian systems. Conceptually the long-termgoals are the same across projects and involve three primary areas of inquiry. First using sensitive geneticapproaches proteins and DNA motifs whose presence affect the funneling of the repair intermediates into themaelstrom of destabilizing repair mechanisms will be identified. Second a combination of in vivo and in vitroapproaches will be used to model and investigate the cell's decision points to understand the circumstances(structures kinetics participating proteins etc.) that draw intermediates into high-risk and/or toxic repairpathways. Third the patterns of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements that result from the deleteriousrepair pathways will be evaluated and computational approaches will be used to apply these findings tohuman genome databases. To this end MMBIRFinder new software developed from previous research willbe used to detect complex genetic changes that cannot be found by currently available algorithms. Overall thisresearch program will bring improved clarity regarding the mechanisms of DNA repair intermediate processingwhich will uncover factors that influence the regulation of dangerous repair pathways and result indestabilization of the genome in eukaryotes.","Affect;Algorithms;Area;Automobile Driving;Cell Death;Cell Survival;Cells;Chromosomal Rearrangement;Complex;DNA;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Pathway;DNA Sequence Rearrangement;DNA biosynthesis;DNA lesion;Dangerousness;Development;Disease;Double Strand Break Repair;Eukaryota;Event;Experimental Designs;Funding Opportunities;Genetic;Genome;Genome Stability;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;HO nuclease;Human;Human Genome;In Vitro;Joints;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lesion;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neurologic;Organism;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Plant Roots;Positioning Attribute;Process;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Role;Single-Stranded DNA;Site;Structure;Syndrome;System;Therapeutic Intervention;Work;Yeasts;genetic approach;genome database;high risk;human disease;improved;in vivo;interest;programs;repaired;software development","Double strand break repair maelstrom: causes mechanisms and genome destabilizing consequences","The relevance of complex genetic changes to many human diseases including cancer and many neurologicaland developmental syndromes is well established.

The goal of these reviews is to compile the numerous sources of toxicologicaldata describing these compounds and make the data more widely available to othergovernment agencies researchers stakeholders and the American public. The EPA iscurrently working towards the ambitious goal of reviewing and reporting on over 9000 PFAS by2022. The EPA CPAD aims to achieve this goal using ""Systematic Evidence Mapping"" (SEM)techniques. The proposed K.C. Donnelly externship project would involve the applicant'sparticipation in the screening data extraction and data visualization processes required toconstruct the evidence maps posted on the EPA PFAS dashboard. Outcomes of the externshipproject for the applicant would include an enhanced familiarity with PFAS' wide-rangingphysical-chemical properties and associated toxicological effects; intimate knowledge of theEPA CPAD's SEM process data management strategies and data visualization techniques; aswell as a greater insight into the role of Federal government in protecting our naturalenvironment.","American;Chemicals;Data;Environment;Familiarity;Federal Government;Goals;Government Agencies;Health;Human;Knowledge;Maps;Outcome;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Process;Reporting;Research Personnel;Review Literature;Role;Source;Techniques;Toxic effect;Toxicology;chemical property;dashboard;data management;data visualization;externship;insight;pollutant;remediation;screening","Airborne PCBs: Sources Exposures Toxicities Remediation","","NIEHS","10381933","7/16/2021","PA-20-272","3P42ES013661-16S2","3","P42","ES","013661","16","S2","HENRY, HEATHER F","5/12/2006","1/31/2025"," "," ","7661749","HORNBUCKLE, KERI C","Not Applicable","01","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/16/2021","1/31/2022"," ","143","Research Centers","2021","11201"," ","NIEHS","7250","3951"," ","11201",
"Back Pain; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Complementary and Integrative Health; Health Services; Pain Research","ABSTRACTThe prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among U.S. adults is estimated at 20% with 50-80% of peoplereporting a significant episode at some point in their life and 23% of LBP patients reporting pain of highintensity with disability. The greatest burden placed on society occurs when LBP becomes chronic (cLBP).Inadequately managed chronic pain results in greater loss of productivity; increased expenditures forhospitalization surgery and medications; and costly out-of-pocket patient expenses. Given their high rates ofmusculoskeletal disease cLBP-related disability is rampant within our nation's Veteran population. Thecombination of cLBP and high medication use negatively impacts Veterans' work productivity and quality of lifeand generates substantial risk for long-term disability and opioid addiction. There is arguably no moreimportant population than Veterans for performing research to evaluate effective non-pharmacologicaltreatments that are safe pain relieving cost-effective and contain promise to restore function and quality oflife. One such option is chiropractic care. Several key factors support the need to deepen the study ofchiropractic care within the Veteran population: 1) biological models offer strong support for plausibility; 2)sufficient strength of evidence in systematic reviews has garnered a recommendation by American College ofPhysicians for spinal manipulation and/or chiropractic care targeting cLBP and 3) since beginning in 2004 theVeterans Health Administration (VA) has successfully integrated 115 doctors of chiropractic into ambulatorycare settings. These advances in chiropractic care integration have occurred despite substantial knowledgegaps particularly within VA. Specifically studies examining the delivery of chiropractic interventions have beenhighly variable and there is no optimal dosing in terms of treatment duration or number of visits.

"Back Pain; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Complementary and Integrative Health; Health Services; Pain Research","ABSTRACTThe prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among U.S. adults is estimated at 20% with 50-80% of peoplereporting a significant episode at some point in their life and 23% of LBP patients reporting pain of highintensity with disability. The greatest burden placed on society occurs when LBP becomes chronic (cLBP).Inadequately managed chronic pain results in greater loss of productivity; increased expenditures forhospitalization surgery and medications; and costly out-of-pocket patient expenses. Given their high rates ofmusculoskeletal disease cLBP-related disability is rampant within our nation's Veteran population. Thecombination of cLBP and high medication use negatively impacts Veterans' work productivity and quality of lifeand generates substantial risk for long-term disability and opioid addiction. There is arguably no moreimportant population than Veterans for performing research to evaluate effective non-pharmacologicaltreatments that are safe pain relieving cost-effective and contain promise to restore function and quality oflife. One such option is chiropractic care. Several key factors support the need to deepen the study ofchiropractic care within the Veteran population: 1) biological models offer strong support for plausibility; 2)sufficient strength of evidence in systematic reviews has garnered a recommendation by American College ofPhysicians for spinal manipulation and/or chiropractic care targeting cLBP and 3) since beginning in 2004 theVeterans Health Administration (VA) has successfully integrated 115 doctors of chiropractic into ambulatorycare settings. These advances in chiropractic care integration have occurred despite substantial knowledgegaps particularly within VA. Specifically studies examining the delivery of chiropractic interventions have beenhighly variable and there is no optimal dosing in terms of treatment duration or number of visits. Thus theproposed study of Veterans age 18 and older with a diagnosis of cLBP is highly significant.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Genetics; Human Genome","ABSTRACTTo maintain stable genomes cells carry out an accurate and timely replication program and repair suchdeleterious DNA lesions as double-stranded breaks inter-strand crosslinks and damaged replication forks.Project 1 of the parent NIH R35GM131704 MIRA grant (PI: Spies) investigates the molecular machinery ofhomologous recombination (HR) a cellular process that provides the most accurate means to repair of thesedeleterious DNA lesions and damaged replication forks and thereby contributes to genome stability in normalcells but also helps cancerous cells to develop resistance to radiation and DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Weare building a quantitative description of the central step in HR and its regulation which will draw on theimportance of protein plasticity and conformational dynamics in molecular recognition. Project 2 investigatesmultipurpose DNA repair helicases and their ability to coordinate DNA replication through difficult to replicateregions thus also contributing to genome stability. Both projects utilize single-molecule total internal reflectionfluorescence microscopy (smTIRFM) to visualize and quantify the dynamic assembly and remodeling of thenucleoprotein complexes coordinating HR and processing of alternative DNA structures. Mass photometry is apowerful new technique that will add a new dimension to our measurements by allowing us to quantify thedistributions of the molecular species constituting nucleoprotein complexes.This application requests funds for acquisition of the Refeyn OneMP Mass Photometer an instrument thatuses interferometric scattering (iSCAT aka iScaMS) for label-free detection of molecular mass of individualmacromolecules in solution. This system will facilitate our capacity to perform the experiments proposed in theparent R35 award and will significantly enhance the rigor of our approaches. Mass photometry will be highlycomplementary to smTIRFM analyses as it will allow us to directly assess the distributions of oligomeric statesof the RAD51 recombinase and its mutants with altered RAD51-RAD51 interface at low physiologicallyrelevant concentrations we use in the smTIRFM studies. We will be able to quantitatively evaluate how theoligomeric states of RAD51 and heterogeneity of the RAD51- and RPA-containing complexes change withchanging the solution conditions (including conditions permitting and restricting ATP hydrolysis and thepresence of small molecule inhibitors that may affect the RAD51-RAD51 binding affinity). We will be able tounambiguously determine the equilibrium dissociation constants for and composition of complexes containingRAD51 and the RAD51-interacting fragments of the tumor suppressor BRCA2 and will follow the formation ofthe RAD51 nucleoprotein filament in a manner complementary to our smTIRFM measurements. Addition of thesingle-molecule iSCAT measurements will help us to build a completely new picture of the nexus betweenperturbations of the RAD51 monomer-monomer interface and the filament properties in HR and duringreplication.","ATP Hydrolysis;Affect;Affinity;Amino Acids;Award;BRCA2 gene;Binding;Biological Assay;C-terminal;Cancerous;Cell physiology;Cells;Complex;Cryoelectron Microscopy;Crystallography;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;DNA Replication Damage;DNA Structure;DNA biosynthesis;DNA lesion;DNA replication fork;DNA-Protein Interaction;Data;Detection;Dimensions;Dissociation;Equilibrium;Filament;Fluorescence Microscopy;Funding;Gap Junctions;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Recombination;Genome;Genome Stability;Grant;Heterogeneity;Human;Individual;Iowa;Label;Letters;Link;Macromolecular Complexes;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Mediator of activation protein;Medicine;Microscopy;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Machines;Monitor;Normal Cell;Nucleic Acids;Nucleoproteins;Parents;Photometry;Physiological;Property;Proteins;Protomer;RAD52 gene;Rad51 recombinase;Radiation induced damage;Regulation;Reporting;Request for Applications;Research;Resistance development;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Support Contracts;Surface;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;anti-cancer therapeutic;base;chemotherapy;college;crosslink;dimer;experimental study;falls;genome integrity;genotoxicity;helicase;homologous recombination;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;instrument;macromolecule;molecular dynamics;molecular mass;molecular recognition;monomer;mutant;novel;nuclease;preservation;prevent;programs;repaired;single molecule;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;stoichiometry;tool","Assembly and Dynamics of Molecular Machines in Genome Maintenance","PROJECT NARRATIVEMolecular machinery of homologous recombination maintains integrity of the genome by promoting faithfulrepair of the most genotoxic DNA lesions and faithful genome replication.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Malaria; Nutrition; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","ABSTRACTThere is currently a lack of mechanistic understanding of why humoral immunity against malaria is not efficientlyinduced and why Plasmodium infections are associated immune failures even following repeated infections. Ourlong-term goal is to determine how Plasmodium parasites and potentially other protozoan infections co-opt andsubvert humoral immunity which will help with the identification and development of new immune-basedinterventions against devastating diseases like malaria. The objectives of this project are to define mechanismsthat trigger initial humoral immune dysregulation and study the consequences of these events on the formationof durable humoral immune memory. Our central hypothesis is that robust humoral immunity does not developefficiently because polyclonal B cell activation events establish a nutrient sink that impairs the metabolictranscriptional and epigenetic programming and function of Plasmodium-specific memory B cells. The rationalefor this project is linked to our recent discovery that Plasmodium infection results in a massive polyclonalexpansion of B cells that function as a nutrient sink that limits protective memory B cell responses. Deletion ofthese B cells accelerates blood-stage Plasmodium parasite clearance and enhances humoral immunememory. Supplementing the diet of infected mice with a single amino acid is sufficient to overcome the nutrientsink and metabolic constraints imposed by these B cells and results in enhanced humoral immune memoryresponses. Despite our new findings the molecular mechanisms governing the activation and function ofimmunoinhibitory B cells and the impact of these cells on the affinity and longevity of memory B cells remaincritical knowledge gaps in our quest to improve humoral immunity against malaria. Two Aims address thesepriority questions. In the first Aim we will determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern theexpansion of these immunosuppressive B cells and investigate whether these populations are relevant to otherinfections associated with dysregulated humoral immunity. In the second Aim we will investigate the molecularand cellular consequences of immunosuppressive B cell expansions on the genetic and epigenetic programmingof memory B cells. We have developed several innovative new reagents that afford unprecedented resolutionfor the study anti-malarial humoral immunity. The significance of this project is directly linked to our new findingsshowing that pathophysiological changes that occur during Plasmodium infection durably imprints on B cell fateand function. Thus determining how these pathways coordinately regulate polyclonal B cell activationdevelopment and humoral immunity will be broadly important to those studying infectious disease immunologyand vaccinology.","Address;Affect;Affinity;Amino Acid Transporter;Amino Acids;Antigens;Antimalarials;B-Cell Activation;B-Lymphocytes;Biochemical;Blood;COVID-19;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Cessation of life;Communicable Diseases;Data;Dengue;Detection;Development;Diet;Disease;Ebola;Epigenetic Process;Event;Failure;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Glutamine;Goals;Human;Humoral Immunities;Hyperactivity;Hypoxia;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Memory;Immunology;Impairment;Individual;Infection;Infectious Disease Immunology;Interferons;Intervention;Knowledge;Link;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;Malaria;Mediating;Memory B-Lymphocyte;Metabolic;Metabolism;Molecular;Mus;Nature;Nutrient;Parasites;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern recognition receptor;Plasma Cells;Plasmablast;Plasmodium;Population;Protozoan Infections;Reagent;Receptor Signaling;Reporting;Resistance;Resolution;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Spleen;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;Supplementation;System;Testing;Trypanosomiasis;base;imprint;improved;innovation;novel;novel strategies;nutrient deprivation;pathogen;plasma cell development;programs;response;single cell technology;tool;vaccinology","Mechanisms and consequences of extrafollicular B cell activation during malaria","PROJECT NARRATIVEThere is currently a lack of mechanistic understanding of why humoral immunity against malaria is not efficientlyinduced.

"Aging; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Macular Degeneration; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human","PROJECT SUMMARYAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the western world.While the etiology of AMD is multifactorial dysfunction of the choroidal vasculature which provides themajority of oxygen to retinal photoreceptors has been implicated as the earliest detectable event in AMD.An important contributor to choroidal vascular dysfunction is complement activation. Complement is amultiprotein component of the innate immune system that results in the formation of a lytic structure knownas the membrane attack complex (MAC). While systemic vascular beds remain free from MAC formation thesuperficial choroidal capillary system known as the choriocapillaris uniquely accumulates the MAC withadvancing age. Such MAC accumulation is proposed to cause lytic injury to choriocapillaris endothelial cellsand the downstream sequelae of AMD. However the mechanisms that lead to choriocapillaris MACaccumulation are widely unknown. We hypothesize that unique transcriptional networks drive choriocapillarisdevelopment which make these endothelial cells particularly susceptible to age-related molecular changes andMAC-mediated cell death. To test this hypothesis we propose the following three specific aims:1. Identify molecular features that make the choriocapillaris uniquely susceptible to MAC formation. We willdifferentiate choriocapillaris arterial and venous endothelial cells from human induced pluripotent stem cellsand identify transcriptomic drivers of the choriocapillaris cell fate. After single-cell RNA sequencing we willfunctionally validate choriocapillaris-enriched genes that influence MAC formation in vitro.2. Identify molecular changes in age and AMD that increase choriocapillaris MAC accumulation and MAC-mediated damage. We will identify choroidal endothelial cell gene expression differences between young adult(5th - 6th decade) elderly (8th - 9th decade) and AMD human donors. We will test the degree to whichdifferentially expressed targets in aging choriocapillaris influence formation of the MAC in vitro.3. Determine the role of RGCC in response to the MAC in health and AMD. We will quantify RGCC a generecently identified to be highly expressed in human choriocapillaris and implicated in MAC-mediatedendothelial dysfunction at the RNA and protein level using human choroids from healthy and AMD donors.We will also functionally assess the degree to which RGCC mediates endothelial cell death and dysfunction inboth choriocapillaris and non-ocular endothelial cell lines.When successful these studies will identify novel molecular features that lead to MAC accumulation andchoriocapillaris damage. Further understanding how choriocapillaris cells accumulate and respond to the MACmay lead to new therapeutic targets for AMD supporting the Mission Goals and Objectives of the NEI.","Adult;Affect;Age;Age related macular degeneration;Aging;Apoptosis;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Blood capillaries;Blood flow;Caliber;Cell Cycle;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cells;Choroid;Complement;Complement Activation;Complement Membrane Attack Complex;Data;Deposition;Development;Elderly;Endothelial Cells;Etiology;Event;Eye;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Injury;Innate Immune System;Intervention;Lead;Link;Lytic;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Target;Newborn Infant;Outcomes Research;Oxygen;PECAM1 gene;Pathogenesis;Photoreceptors;Predisposition;Proteins;RNA;Retina;Retinal Photoreceptors;Role;Savings;Seminal;Structure;Structure of retinal pigment epithelium;System;Testing;Tissues;United States;Validation;Vascular Diseases;Venous;Western World;age related;arm;capillary bed;cdc Genes;differential expression;endothelial dysfunction;histological image;induced pluripotent stem cell;new therapeutic target;novel;photoreceptor degeneration;response;single-cell RNA sequencing;stem cells;transcriptome;transcriptomics;vascular bed;vision development;young adult","The Membrane Attack Complex and the Choriocapillaris in Health and Age-Related Macular Degeneration","PROJECT NARRATIVEAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the western world withover 2 million affected individuals in the United States alone.

"Brain Disorders; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI); Traumatic Head and Spine Injury","Project SummaryBlast-mediated traumatic brain injury (bTBI) affects military members and civilians as a direct result of combatworkplace accidents or intentional terrorist attacks. There are currently no effective pharmacologic therapiesfor TBI and treatment is limited to supportive care. The retina is a central nervous system (CNS) tissue that isvulnerable to blast exposure. Individuals with blast-mediated TBI often report visual dysfunction which maymanifest months to years after the initial exposure. These problems include light sensitivity retinopathy opticneuropathy dysfunctional optic motility and visual field loss although little is known about the molecularchanges in both the retina and higher order visual processing centers that lead to visual dysfunction.Following a TBI secondary signaling cascades occur in the brain including robust neuroinflammation thatexacerbates the initial neuronal insult. Modulating neuroinflammation is a potential therapeutic strategy fortreating TBI. The initial inflammatory cascades that occur in the minutes to days following primary tissue injuryinclude interleukin-1 (IL-1) cytokine release. While components of the IL-1 pathway contribute to both CNSrepair and secondary injury overwhelming evidence indicates IL-1 worsens neuronal injury overall after a braininjury. Among members of the IL-1 family IL-1 and IL-1 increase rapidly after TBI in the brain. The exactrole of these cytokines in shaping the neuronal response to TBI is yet unclear and it is unknown whethermodulation of these pathways might prevent neuronal deficits. Furthermore the role of ocular inflammation andthe relative contribution of each IL-1 molecule following TBI has not been systematically explored.My long-term goal is to identify mechanisms of neuroinflammation that contribute to secondary ocular injuryand develop novel targeted therapies. The overall objective of this proposal is to evaluate the role of IL-1pathway molecules in the retina following blast-mediated TBI. My central hypothesis is that blockade of specificIL-1 pathway molecules following TBI will reduce secondary retinal injury and will be achievable with availableanti-IL-1 pathway agents. Understanding the role of individual IL-1 pathway molecules and cellular effectors inthe eye following TBI represents a critical knowledge gap. My study may also reveal novel therapeuticapproaches that utilize drugs already approved for clinical use. To test my hypothesis I propose the followingSpecific Aims: 1) Determine the specific IL-1 pathway molecules that contribute to bTBI pathogenesis in theretina using genetic mouse models and pharmacologic blockade and 2) Determine the role of peripheralcellular effectors contributing to retinal inflammation in bTBI.","Accidents;Acute;Affect;Blindness;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Brain;Brain Injuries;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Structures;Clinical;Cytokine Signaling;Data;Detection;Development;Dissection;Drug Utilization;Electroretinography;Eye;Eye Injuries;Family;Family member;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Immune;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 alpha;Interleukin-1 beta;Invaded;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Label;Lead;Leukocytes;Mediating;Military Personnel;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Neuraxis;Neuronal Injury;Neurons;Optical Coherence Tomography;Optics;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Peripheral;Pharmacology;Photophobia;Recombinants;Reporting;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Role;Secondary to;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Structure;Supportive care;TBI treatment;Terrorism;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Traumatic Brain Injury;Tumor-infiltrating immune cells;Vision;Visual;Visual Fields;Workplace;anakinra;blast exposure;cell motility;clinically relevant;combat;cytokine;improved outcome;in vivo;insight;member;mouse model;neuroinflammation;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;null mutation;optic nerve disorder;preservation;prevent;receptor;repaired;response;retinal damage;service member;targeted agent;targeted treatment;therapeutic candidate;therapy development;tissue injury;vision development;visual dysfunction;visual processing","Dissection and manipulation of inflammatory pathways underlying post-traumatic visual outcomes","Project NarrativeBlast-mediated traumatic brain injury (bTBI) affects military members and civilians as a directresult of combat workplace accidents or intentional terrorist attacks.

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTTinnitus the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source is a prevalent hearingdisorder. To date the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus isassociated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however almost 50% of tinnitus casesare not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus(Sand et al 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are geneticallypredisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 EarlyCareer Research PAR 16-057 application entitled Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibilityis to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application isproposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A FAAA) who is workingwith Co-PIs Jason Wilder Ph.D. in genetics Jin Wang Ph.D. in statistics and Raquel Dias Ph.D. inBioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with agenetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age-related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PIs pilot study(Bhatt 2017a) the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT) acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) isaround 8% 13% and 79% respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal we will conduct a case-control-control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into threegroups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100) (2) AT (tinnitus for  1 year presumably due to acuteenvironmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aimsare: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitusphenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt 2017a; Bhatt et al. 2016; Phillip etal. 2015) our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype forsubjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in acandidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT AT and NT Based on ourpreliminary studies (Bhatt et al. 2016 Phillips et al. 2015) our working hypothesis is that subjects with causalalleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successfulcompletion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us toachieve our long term goal which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-careproviders and educators (e.g. health professionals music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individualsgenetically at risk for CT.","Acute;Address;Adolescent;Age;Aging;American;Anxiety;Audiology;Auditory Evoked Potentials;Auditory Perception;Bioinformatics;Candidate Disease Gene;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinical;Complex;Confounding Factors (Epidemiology);Development;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Risk Factor;Ethnic Origin;Exhibits;Exposure to;Family;Financial compensation;Frequencies;General Population;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Risk;Genetic study;Genotype;Goals;Health;Health Personnel;Health Policy;Health Professional;Hearing;Hearing problem;Human;Hyperacusis;Impaired cognition;Individual;Industrial Arts;Investigation;Knowledge;Machine Learning;Measures;Mental Depression;Military Personnel;Modeling;Molecular;Multivariate Analysis;Music;Noise;Nucleotides;Otitis Media;PTGS1 gene;PTGS2 gene;Participant;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phenotype;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Policy Maker;Population;Predisposition;Prevalence;Prevention strategy;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Public Health;Quality of life;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Factors;Sampling;Serotonin;Silicon Dioxide;Sleeplessness;Smoking;Sodium;Source;Systemic disease;Testing;Tinnitus;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Variant;Veterans;age related;aged;aging population;base;career;case control;causal variant;clinical development;college;experience;gene environment interaction;genetic association;genetic testing;genetic variant;genome wide association study;hearing impairment;individualized medicine;innovation;insight;knowledge base;learning strategy;novel;otoacoustic emission;preventive intervention;relating to nervous system;serotonin receptor;serotonin transporter;sound;statistics;teacher;trait;treatment strategy;voltage gated channel;young adult","Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility","Project NarrativeTinnitus the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source is aprevalent hearing disorder.

The etiology is multifactorial with a complex interaction of genetic andenvironmental factors. Several strategies have been used to identify the genetic etiology of OFCs; theseinclude Linkage Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). Therobustness of WGS data allows the discovery of new cleft risk loci and candidate genes while also providingthe opportunity to identify ""incidental findings"" different from the primary research intent that may haveimmediate medical implications for study participants and their relatives. Evidence suggests that stigmatizationfrom family members friends community members health-care workers and the affected parents areassociated with OFCs. Maximizing beneficence and justice from results in a population with vast geneticdiversity albeit underrepresented in genetic and genomic research requires working with several people andexploring methods with proven success in these regions including community engagement. Availableevidence has shown gatekeepers to be influential in research across varying context in Africa. However thereis little information on the role of gatekeepers in genetics and genomics research. The proposed research aimsto assess the understanding of community gatekeepers in Nigeria and their opinions on communicatingincidental genetic research findings in the context of OFCs that is already associated with stigmatization. Thiswill be achieved by addressing the following (1) determine the feelings of gatekeepers about genomic riskinformation (2) explore the opinions of gatekeepers on the acceptance of incidental findings by their membersand (3) evaluate the possibility of religious leaders' involvement in participatory and collaborative decision-making for genomic research risk communications. This project will be driven by Dr Butali as PrincipalInvestigator. He will collaborate with Dr. Odukoya at the University of Lagos and Dr. Adeyemo at the NHGRI.Collectively we anticipate that this study will help create the awareness for omics research amongst thegatekeepers who in turn from their point of influence will increase genomic research awareness in the public.","Address;Affect;Africa;African;Attitude;Awareness;Belief;Beneficence;Birth;COVID-19 pandemic;Candidate Disease Gene;Caring;Christianity;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Complex;Congenital Disorders;Country;Data;Decision Making;Deformity;Elderly;Environmental Risk Factor;Etiology;Face;Family;Family Planning;Family member;Feeling;Focus Groups;Friends;Gatekeeping;Genetic;Genetic Counseling;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Research;Genetic Variation;Genomics;Health;Health Personnel;Human;Incidental Findings;Individual;Influentials;Infrastructure;Inherited;Institution;Iowa;Justice;Knowledge;Live Birth;Medical;Methods;Muslim religion;Mutation;National Human Genome Research Institute;Nigeria;Parents;Participant;Play;Poliomyelitis;Population;Principal Investigator;Public Health;Publications;Qualitative Research;Religion;Religion and Spirituality;Research;Research Methodology;Resources;Rest;Risk;Role;Running;Services;Stigmatization;Thinking;Underrepresented Populations;Universities;base;community engagement;congenital anomaly;genetic testing;genome sequencing;genome wide association study;insight;member;orofacial cleft;public health intervention;risk mitigation;risk variant;social stigma;success;whole genome","Whole Genome Sequencing for Orofacial Clefts Incidental Findings and Role of Community Gatekeepers","Project NarrativeThe focus of the proposal is to assess the understanding of community gatekeepers in Nigeriaand their opinions on communicating incidental genetic research findings in the context of OFCsthat is already associated with stigmatization.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Malaria; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYMosquitoes have developed a robust innate immune system comprised of cellular and humoral immuneresponses that together shape mosquito vector competence which as a result has garnered significant interestas potential targets to make mosquitoes refractory to disease transmission. Immune cells known as hemocytesare central to mosquito cellular and humoral immune responses that include phagocytosis the establishment ofimmune memory and the recognition and killing of malaria parasites. Yet despite their importance studies ofmosquito hemocytes have been limited by a lack of genetic resources that have limited their characterization tomorphological properties of size and shape. With a long-term goal to characterize mosquito immune cellpopulations and their contributions to innate immunity the overall objective of this application is to developgenetic tools and resources to improve our understanding of mosquito immune cell function. Recent single-cellstudies have characterized mosquito immune cell populations with new and increased resolution providing theidentification of candidate universal or subtype-specific marker genes that define immune cell sub-populations.Serving as the foundation and rationale of this proposal regulatory regions of these candidate hemocytemarker genes will be used to generate transgenic Anopheles mosquitoes that drive fluorescent markers (Aim 1)or transcriptional activators (Aim 2) in distinct immune cell populations. Together our proposed experiments willprovide valuable new genetic resources for the mosquito hemocyte community that will significantly advance ourunderstanding of Anopheles immune cell biology while serving as the foundation for future studies to betterdefine the contributions of hemocytes to malaria parasite killing.","Ablation;Anopheles Genus;Anopheles gambiae;Apoptotic;Automobile Driving;Basic Science;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Biology;Cell Count;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular biology;Classification;Communities;Culicidae;Development;Double-Stranded RNA;Drosophila genus;Foundations;Future;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Crosses;Genetic Markers;Genetic study;Goals;Hematopoiesis;Hemocytes;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunologic Memory;Injections;Innate Immune System;Insecta;Interruption;Label;Lectin;Longevity;Malaria;Masks;Mediating;Methodology;Mission;Molecular;Morphology;Mosquito-borne infectious disease;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;Natural Immunity;Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences;Parasites;Phagocytosis;Physiological;Population;Property;Proteins;Publishing;Refractory;Resolution;Resources;Role;Shapes;Stains;Stimulus;System;Technology;Time;Tissues;Transcription Coactivator;Transgenic Organisms;United States National Institutes of Health;Visualization;Work;base;candidate identification;candidate marker;cell type;defined contribution;disease transmission;enteric pathogen;experience;experimental study;gene function;genetic resource;granulocyte;human disease;improved;in vivo;interest;lipophilicity;malaria transmission;memory recognition;mosquito-borne pathogen;pathogen;prevent;promoter;response;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;tool;transmission process;vector;vector competence;vector mosquito","Development of genetic tools for the study of mosquito hemocytes","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe mosquito innate immune system is central to defining whether mosquitoes can transmit various mosquito-borne pathogens that collectively cause more than 300 million human cases every year.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cannabinoid Research; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Endocannabinoid System Research; Nutrition; Obesity; Physical Activity; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTOverweight/obesity often precedes the emergence of cardiometabolic dysregulation yet the dire progressiontoward cardiometabolic diseases (e.g. diabetes heart disease) could be averted if there were effectiveapproaches to regulate the endocannabinoid system (ECS) a compelling therapeutic target that is hyperactivein overweight/obesity. ECS hyperactivity not only contributes to a constellation of cardiometabolic risk factorslike insulin resistance dyslipidemia visceral fat and high blood pressure but also increased appetite for fattyfoods which perpetuates a vicious cycle of escalating ECS hyperactivity and cardiometabolic dysregulation.Despite nearly 20 years of drug discovery and large clinical trial efforts there are still no ECS medications thathave been approved for the treatment of overweight/obesity mainly because these medications while highlyeffective for cardiometabolic health cause unacceptable psychiatric side effects. Thus the long-term goal ofthis research is to identify effective non-pharmacological approaches to intervene in (i.e. break) the ECS-perpetuated cycle of increased appetite/weight gain and worsening cardiometabolic health. The overallobjective in this proposal is to determine whether exercise specifically what type of exercise (e.g. aerobic vs.resistance vs. both) is a viable approach to reduce ECS hyperactivity and improve cardiometabolic health inadults with overweight/obesity. The central hypothesis is that aerobic exercise in particular reduces ECShyperactivity which mediates the well-known benefits of aerobic exercise on cardiometabolic health. Thecentral hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the effects of 12 months ofaerobic resistance and combined aerobic and resistance exercise on the ECS in 406 well-phenotyped adultswith overweight/obesity by performing mass spectrometry and gene expression analysis on >1200 storedblood specimens from an NIH-funded clinical exercise trial; and 2) Evaluate the relationship of changes in theECS with changes in established cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g. blood pressure lipids insulin resistance)in response to 12 months of exercise training by performing a casual mediation analysis. This project isinnovative because it focuses on multiple components (i.e. ligands receptors enzymes) of the ECS asemerging and distinct mechanisms to study the diverse effects of exercise on cardiometabolic health and itdirectly compares the cardiometabolic health benefits and underlying mechanisms among different types andcombinations of exercise particularly resistance exercise which has been largely overlooked with regard tothe ECS. This comprehensive mechanistic investigation of ECS adaptations in response to different types oflong-term exercise training is significant because it is likely to offer a novel scientific framework from whichalternative safe and effective endocannabinoid medications can be explored and developed. Furthermorethis research will advance individualized clinical exercise prescriptions (e.g. recommended modality) for themore than two-thirds of US adults with overweight/obesity who are at-risk for cardiometabolic disease.","Address;Adult;Aerobic;Aerobic Exercise;Blood Pressure;Blood specimen;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Cardiac;Cardiometabolic Disease;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Data Analyses;Desire for food;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Digestive System Disorders;Dyslipidemias;Endocannabinoids;Energy Intake;Enzymes;Exercise;Food;Foundations;Funding;Gene Expression Profiling;Goals;Health;Health Benefit;Health Care Costs;Heart Diseases;Hyperactivity;Hypertension;Individual;Insulin Resistance;Investigation;Kidney Diseases;Lead;Life Style Modification;Ligands;Lipids;Lipolysis;Maintenance;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Mediation;Medication Systems;Mental Depression;Metabolic;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolic syndrome;Modality;Obesity;Overweight;Participant;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phenotype;Physiological Processes;Public Health;Research;Resistance;Rest;Rewards;Risk Factors;Role;System;Testing;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Vascular remodeling;Visceral fat;Weight;Weight Gain;adherence rate;adult obesity;base;cardiometabolic risk;cardiometabolism;clinically significant;comorbidity;comparative;disease diagnosis;drug discovery;endogenous cannabinoid system;exercise prescription;exercise training;glucose uptake;hedonic;hemodynamics;improved;increased appetite;innovation;large datasets;middle age;novel;pleasure;receptor;receptor expression;resistance exercise;response;secondary analysis;side effect;therapeutic target","The effect of exercise on the endocannabinoid system as a pathway to cardiometabolic health in adults with overweight/obesity.","PROJECT NARRATIVEWeight loss is generally recommended to improve cardiometabolic health for the two-thirds of US adults withoverweight/obesity; however most people are unable to maintain long-term weight loss potentially due inpart to a vicious cycle of increased appetite weight gain and worsening cardiometabolic health that isperpetuated by a hyperactive endocannabinoid system.

"Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Substance Misuse","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe opioid overdose epidemic is killing Americans at the level of a mass casualty event  Hurricane Katrina killed1577 people but the death toll from opioid overdose in 2018 in California alone was 5348. Synthetic morepotent opioids such as fentanyl and its derivatives are further increasing the numbers of deaths. Naloxone (NLX)an opioid antagonist is the antidote for opioid overdose. NLX works by displacing opioid molecules fromreceptors in the body ultimately reversing the respiratory depression. NLX is administered intravenously (IV)intramuscularly (IM) subcutaneous (SC) or intranasally. Unfortunately all commercially available dosage formshave significant shortcomings making them challenging for pre-hospital settings. Most notably NLX suffers froma very short plasma half-life presenting a risk of overdose relapse if there is a very large amount of opioid in theplasma. This results in need for repeated NLX doses to be given (known as rescue doses) to prevent hypoxiaand this disadvantage is shared by all routes of delivery and is becoming increasingly common. Additionalchallenges include the need for use of needles/syringes with IV/IM/SC delivery which is very risky in the contextof a potentially combative patient; intranasal delivery is not uniformly effective and is contraindicated in thecontext of intranasal damage that is often seen with use of other illicit substances. In this research we proposeto overcome the shortcomings of current NLX dosage forms through development of a novel self-heatingtransdermal patch with microneedles. The long-term goal is to decrease pre-hospital opioid overdose deathsthrough development of the novel transdermal NLX dosage form. The intent is to deliver NLX quickly throughthe skin aiming to achieve consistent and therapeutically relevant drug concentrations without need for rescuedoses. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that NLX will rapidly and continuously absorb through epidermalmicropores and a positive correlation will exist between elevated skin temperature and the rate and extent ofNLX permeation. The patch will include 3 layers: 1) dissolving microneedles 2) a transdermal NLX gel and 3) aheating layer. Each layer fulfills a specific function with the combined effect of producing NLX skin permeationthat can reach plasma levels appropriate for treating opioid overdose. Dissolving NLX microneedles willimmediately start to deliver NLX as they dissolve while also creating micropores to allow transdermal NLXdelivery from the gel. The gel will deliver NLX through the micropores for a minimum of 2 hrs after patchapplication. The heating layer will rapidly generate heat upon air exposure increasing skin temperature andthereby increasing the rate and extent of NLX absorption. The patch is intended to be applied in just one step.In Aim 1 we will optimize each patch layer in vitro to meet predetermined milestones to provide similar deliveryparameters to IM NLX delivery. In Aim 2 the patch layers will be tested in vivo in pharmacokinetic studies inguinea pigs. At the end of the funding period we expect to have a transdermal NLX prototype patch that will beready to quickly move into IND filing and preliminary human studies.","Address;Air;American;Antidotes;Benchmarking;California;Caring;Cause of Death;Cavia;Cessation of life;Clinical;Data;Detection;Development;Disadvantaged;Dosage Forms;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Effectiveness;Ensure;Epidemic;Event;Exposure to;Fentanyl;First Aid;Funding;Gel;Geriatrics;Goals;Half-Life;Health Personnel;Heating;Hospitals;Human;Hurricane;Hypoxia;In Vitro;Individual;Ingestion;Intramuscular;Intravenous;Louisiana;Medical;Methods;Naloxone;Needles;Needlestick Injuries;Opioid;Opioid Antagonist;Overdose;Patients;Pediatrics;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma;Positioning Attribute;Pre-hospital setting;Pregnancy;Preparation;Property;Recording of previous events;Relapse;Reporting;Research;Risk;Route;Skin;Skin Temperature;Surface;Syringes;Temperature;Therapeutic;Thinness;Time;Tissues;Toxicology;Training;United States;Ventilatory Depression;Work;absorption;design;experience;hydrophilicity;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;innovation;loved ones;manufacturing scale-up;mass casualty;micropore;novel;opioid mortality;opioid overdose;overdose risk;patient population;prevent;prototype;receptor;subcutaneous;vehicular accident","Development of a heated transdermal microneedle naloxone patch as an innovative treatment for opioid overdose","PROJECT NARRATIVEDeaths from opioid overdose continue to rise in the United States but current methods for delivering naloxone(the antidote for overdoses) often require multiple doses or medical training for administration  both of whichmay be challenging in pre-hospital settings while waiting for medical help to arrive.

We offer five special strengths to the Network.  1. Our NICU's clinical outcomes are superb - among the best in the world. Our ELBW mortality rate is perennially among the lowest in the Neonatal Research Network and most years we have the lowest rate of the composite outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment.  2. We have a strong tradition and track record of important contributions in clinical research in neonates andinfants. In the obstetrics units and the NICU we have a robust infrastructure for the conduct and support of clinical research that has contributed to our productivity.  3. We have considerable expertise and resources in the area of genetics including our Perinatal Research DNA Bank which was created in 1999. Samples from our DNA Bank and others are being used for research on the genetic influences of neonatal disease. During our first 10 years in the Network members of our team have worked with others in the Network to apply genetics and genomics approaches on a Network-wide scale including a proposal to develop a prospective DNA repository.  4. As the only academic medical center in a largely rural state with an economy based in agriculture we represent a population that is not otherwise well represented in the NICHD Network. If the results of Network studies are to be generalized to patients throughout the country this large area of the country should be represented. The University of Iowa Network center represents this region and population.  5. We have performed extremely well as a Network center during the past 5 years. We have contributed 15% (17/114) of the new projects submitted for consideration since we joined the Network. Our ELBW mortality rate is always among the lowest in the Network which allows us to see a large number of infants in follow-up.","Academic Medical Centers;Address;Agriculture;Area;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Collaborations;Country;DNA Library;DNA Repository;Discipline of obstetrics;Disease;Enrollment;Ensure;Evaluation;Faculty;Fostering;Genetic;Genomic approach;Genomics;Infant;Infrastructure;Iowa;Longterm Follow-up;Medicine;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Multicenter Neonatal Research Network;Multicenter Trials;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Neonatal;Neonatal Intensive Care;Neonatology;Neurodevelopmental Impairment;Newborn Infant;Outcome;Patients;Pediatrics;Perinatal;Population;Premature Infant;Productivity;Research;Resources;Role;Rural;Rural Population;Safety;Sampling;Therapeutic;Time;Translations;Universities;Work;base;career development;clinical practice;critically ill newborn;design;follow-up;genetic approach;member;mortality;neonatal health;neonate;novel therapeutics;population based;pressure;programs;prospective;public health relevance;research study;success","NICHD Cooperative Multicenter Neonatal Research Network","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Some of the most important clinical advances in the field of neonatology have been derived from the research studies of the Neonatal Research Network and other similar clinical research.

"Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Headaches; Migraines; Neurosciences; Pain Research","Perivascular mechanisms of CGRP-induced migraine symptomsProject SummaryMigraine is a debilitating neurological condition involving the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP). It affects 15% of the population and is the second leading cause of years lived with a disability.Indeed over 40% of women will experience migraine during their lifetime. An exciting development is therecent FDA approval of a new class of CGRP-targeted drugs designed to prevent migraine. However a criticalneed remains because these drugs do not work for all patients. To improve the efficacy of CGRP-based drugsand pave the way for new drug development we need to know more about how CGRP works in migraine. Theobjective of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which CGRP acts at both peripheral and central sitesto trigger migraine-like symptoms. The scientific premise is that migraine involves increased sensitivity toCGRP which is supported by clinical studies that have shown CGRP is both required and sufficient to causemigraine. During the past funding period we developed transgenic mice that are sensitized to CGRP actions.The CGRP-sensitized mice have elevated expression of a subunit of the CGRP receptor called humanreceptor activity-modifying protein 1 (hRAMP1). We found that CGRP causes a migraine-like symptom(photophobia) by distinct but possibly overlapping actions in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery.Here we propose to measure migraine-like symptoms in wildtype and hRAMP1 transgenic mice using lightaversion as an indicator of photophobia and touch sensitivity and grimace as indicators of pain. Wehypothesize that CGRP acts at perivascular sites in the dura and thalamus to cause migraine-like symptoms ofphotophobia and pain. Specifically we propose that CGRP-induced vasodilation in the periphery alters thetrigeminovascular microenvironment and that centrally it facilitates the action of CGRP as a neuromodulator inthe posterior thalamic region. The first aim will test whether peripheral CGRP mechanisms involve actions onblood and lymphatic vessels and resident mast cells in the dura. The second aim will test whether centralCGRP mechanisms involve perivascular and neuromodulatory actions in the posterior thalamic nuclei.Complementary genetic and pharmacological strategies will be used in both aims. These studies will provideinsight into the mechanisms that enable CGRP to act both centrally and peripherally via the vasculature toaffect sensory functions in a neurological disorder. Despite advances in our understanding of migraine over thepast decade many questions remain unanswered in part due to the paucity of appropriate animal models. Theuse of our novel CGRP-sensitized hRAMP1 mice represents an innovative approach for challenging thecurrent dogma regarding the vascular roles of CGRP in the periphery and brain. The outcome of this proposalwill be the uncovering of perivascular CGRP actions in the dura and CNS that induce migraine-like symptoms.Importantly this will facilitate development of vascular-targeted and CNS-penetrant therapeutics for migraine.","Affect;Animal Model;Behavior;Biological;Blocking Antibodies;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain region;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Calcitonin-Gene Related Peptide Receptor;Clinical;Clinical Research;Closure by clamp;Complex;Data;Development;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;Dura Mater;Endothelial Cells;Fiber;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Headache;Human;Injections;Knowledge;Light;Lymphocyte;Measures;Migraine;Modeling;Mus;Neuraxis;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neurologic;Neuromodulator;Neuropeptides;New Agents;Outcome;Outcome Study;Pain;Patients;Peptide Signal Sequences;Pericytes;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Photophobia;Play;Population;Posterior Thalamic Nuclei;Public Health;Research;Retina;Role;Sensory;Sensory Disorders;Signal Transduction;Site;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Societies;Symptoms;Systemic blood pressure;Tactile;Testing;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;Tissues;Touch sensation;Transgenic Mice;Vasodilation;Woman;Work;allodynia;base;cell type;central sensitization;chronic painful condition;clinically relevant;disability;drug development;experience;experimental study;improved;innovation;insight;lymphatic vessel;mast cell;mouse model;nervous system disorder;neuroregulation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel drug class;novel therapeutics;optogenetics;overexpression;pain signal;parabrachial nucleus;prevent;receptor;receptor-activity-modifying protein;therapeutic target;vascular contributions","Perivascular mechanisms of CGRP-induced migraine symptoms","RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTHMigraine represents a significant burden to society.

"Clinical Research; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention","Project SummaryWorldwide more than 1 in 10 babies born are premature (<37 weeks gestation) and the incidence is on therise. The recent increase in preterm (PT) births is the result of the rise in late preterm (LPT) birth (34 to 36weeks gestation) which constitute the largest and fastest growing portion of all PT births. Children with LPTare at significant risk to experience mathematical difficulties in school. Mathematical skills are paramount tolater life outcomes including adulthood health and wealth. Math success in school is rooted in numerical andspatial skills that develop during preschool years. However a significant knowledge gap exists on the origins ofLPTs math difficulties. The long-term goal for this application is to identify the mechanisms that underlieacademic difficulties in PT children. The overall objective for this application is to characterize the developmentof numerical and spatial skills (NS) among LPTs and to identify the key factors that explain individualdifferences in NS skills in LPTs and Term children during preschool years. The central hypothesis is that LPTswill exhibit specific difficulties in NS tasks compared to Term children controlling for general cognitiveperformance. Further prematurity and parental factors (parental language NS input) will interact in predictingindividual differences in NS skill in LPT and Term children. The rationale that underlies the proposed project isthat once NS development in LPTs is better understood evidence-based early identification and interventionmethods can be developed to support at-risk LPTs before math difficulties in school emerge. The centralhypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Compare the differences in NS skills of LPT andTerm children at age 4 to 5 years; and 2) Determine the relation between parental NS language input and NSskills of LPT and Term children at age 4 to 5 years. For the first aim childrens verbal and nonverbal NS skillswill be assessed using experimental and standardized measures. For the second aim parental language inputabout NS concepts (e.g. counting cardinality spatial terms) during a semi-naturalistic play interaction in thelab will be identified. The research proposed in this application is innovative in the applicants opinionbecause it departs from the status quo in research on PTs by focusing on late prematurity and preschoolyears combining experimental standardized and observational measures and examining the role ofexperiential factors that might serve as modifiable risk factors that stakeholders can target. The proposal issignificant because it will inform efforts targeting early NS difficulties and thereby maximize LPTs futurepotential. Ultimately such knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development ofinnovative and effective early prevention and interventions that leverage home support to prevent academicdifficulties in at-risk children.","37 weeks gestation;Adult;Age;Area;Birth Weight;Caring;Characteristics;Child;Child Support;Clinics and Hospitals;Collaborations;Data;Development;Early Intervention;Early identification;Elderly;Exhibits;Future;Gestational Age;Goals;Health;Home;Incidence;Individual Differences;Interdisciplinary Study;Intervention;Iowa;Knowledge;Language;Life;Mathematics;Measures;Medical;Methods;Mission;Neurocognitive;Nursery Schools;Outcome;PF4 Gene;Parents;Performance;Plant Roots;Play;Population;Pregnancy;Premature Birth;Premature Infant;Prevention;Productivity;Public Health;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Schools;Socioeconomic Status;Source;Special Education;Standardization;Testing;Toy;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Variant;aged;cognitive performance;cost;delivery complications;evidence base;experience;improved;innovation;literacy;mathematical difficulties;modifiable risk;neglect;peer;perinatal health;premature;prevent;preventive intervention;provider factors;recruit;skill acquisition;skills;standardize measure;success","Identifying Relationships between Late Premature Birth Parental Factors and Early Numerical and Spatial Development","Project NarrativeThe proposed project is relevant to public health because rates of late preterm birth (gestational age 34 to 36weeks) are increasing and children with late preterm birth are at significant risk for math difficulties predictiveof significant life outcomes.

"Clinical Research; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTNeonates have dampened expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and difficulty clearing pathogens makingthem uniquely susceptible to infections. This is a worldwide health problem with neonatal infectionscontributing to nearly one million deaths each year. The factors controlling neonatal specific immuneresponses and how and when they transition to more mature responses are poorly understood. Neonates relyheavily on innate immune responses to fight infections due to major defects in their adaptive immune system.Monocytes and macrophages are central to innate immune responses by sensing pathogens and initiating aninflammatory cascade that directs their clearance. Although both neonatal and adult monocytes/macrophagescontain the same genetic code they exhibit dramatic differences in pathogen-induced gene expression. Post-translational histone modifications can regulate gene transcription by influencing chromatin structure andaccessibility and likely play a role in this. Monocytes/macrophages demonstrate a developmental stage-specific increase in the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL1 with an associated gain in the activating histonemodification histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at promoter sites of immunologically important genesas development progresses from extremely preterm neonate to adult. This gain allows for increasingly robustinflammatory responses as development advances. Microbial colonization of the skin and gastrointestinal tractoccurs after birth and is associated with type 1 interferon expression which is believed to guide immunesystem maturation and prevent detrimental pathogen responses. Chorioamnionitis is an inflammatory processaffecting neonates around the time of birth which negatively impacts immune system development andpredisposes exposed neonates to long-term immune-related complications. The central hypothesis of thisproposal is that neonatal monocytes/macrophages are largely un-patterned with H3K4me3 due to lackof in utero microbial exposure and that postnatal microbial exposure stimulates low grade type 1 IFNexpression which drives MLL1 expression and directs macrophage H3K4me3 deposition in adevelopmental stage-specific manner. Chorioamnionitis exposure stimulates a developmentallyinappropriate level of type 1 interferon expression which results in dysregulated MLL1 expression andglobal remodeling of the neonatal monocyte/macrophage landscape with subsequent dysfunctionalmonocyte/macrophage responses. This hypothesis will be investigated via the following specific aims: 1)Characterize normal human monocyte H3K4me3 patterning during infancy and early childhood and determinehow developmental stage-specific H3K4me3 monocyte patterning impacts chromatin accessibility and geneexpression 2) Determine the requirement and sufficiency of type 1 interferons in MLL1-driven H3K4me3placement in murine macrophage development and function and 3) Determine the roles of type 1 interferonsand MLL1 in chorioamnionitis-induced murine macrophage H3K4me3 remodeling and subsequent function.","ATAC-seq;Adaptive Immune System;Adult;Advanced Development;Affect;Asthma;Birth;Bone Marrow;Cells;Cessation of life;ChIP-seq;Chemotaxis;Child;Chorion;Chromatin;Chromatin Structure;Chronic;Defect;Deposition;Development;Disease;Environment;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genetic Code;Genetic Transcription;Germ-Free;Health;Homeostasis;Human;IFNAR1 gene;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologics;Infant;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Innate Immune Response;Interferons;Intestines;Lead;Lysine;MLL gene;Mediating;Methyltransferase;Microbe;Mixed-Lineage Leukemia;Mus;Myelogenous;Neonatal;Outcome;Pattern;Perinatal;Phenotype;Placenta;Play;Premature Birth;Process;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Skin colonization;Sterility;Systems Development;Techniques;Time;amnion;cytokine;early childhood;early life exposure;experimental study;fetal;fighting;global health;high risk;histone modification;immunoregulation;improved;in utero;infancy;intraamniotic infection;intrauterine environment;macrophage;microbial;microbial colonization;monocyte;mouse model;neonatal death;neonatal immune system;neonatal infection;neonatal period;neonatal sepsis;neonate;offspring;pathogen;postnatal;preterm newborn;prevent;promoter;response;success;therapeutic target;transcriptome sequencing","Understanding the role of histone3 lysine4 trimethylation in neontal innate immune development under normal and inflammatory conditions","PROJECT NARRATIVENeonatal infections are a global health concern and are due to defects in the neonatal immune systems abilityto respond to and clear pathogens.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","Project Summary/Abstract Aging is associated with declines in cognitive control the mental process that facilitates goal-oriented behaviors. Declining cognitive control affects older adults' ability to have healthy and productivepersonal and professional interactions which decreases quality of life and increases hospitalization andmortality rates. There are currently few effective therapies to treat age-related declines in cognitivecontrol. Thus there is an unmet need to develop new treatments for aging-related cognitive decline.However there is a gap in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of aging-related cognitivedecline. Cognitive control is associated with coordinated patterns of brain activity across a network ofbrain regions that includes the frontal cortex. In particular low-frequency oscillations in the thetafrequency band (4-7 hz) in the frontal cortex have been shown to be important for cognitive control. Theoverall goal of the proposed research is to identify how aging affects these circuit mechanisms. Myoverall hypothesis is that the medial region of the frontal cortex oscillates at theta-band frequency tosupport cognitive control and attenuated midfrontal cortex theta oscillations in older adults accounts foraging-related differences in cognitive control. I will employ two distinct experimental designs to test this overall hypothesis. First I will test thehypothesis that theta oscillations in the medial regions of the frontal cortex demonstrate task-relevanttheta power to a great extent than lateral regions in the frontal cortex. I will test this hypothesis usinghuman intraoperative recordings during intracranial surgeries in cognitively-intact Parkinson's diseaseand essential tremor patients. Second I will examine brain activity of both young and older adults as theycomplete two tasks designed to engage cognitive control. Here I will test the hypothesis that aging-related differences in cognitive control correspond to reduced theta oscillations in the frontal cortex. Thishypothesis predicts that theta-band oscillations will be lower in older adults compared to young adultsand reduced theta oscillations will be associated with worse cognitive control. Together the proposed experiments will contribute to a model establishing how changes in large-scale oscillatory dynamics in precise regions of the frontal cortex correspond to aging-related declines incognitive control. An outcome of the data from this proposal is expected to be knowledge of candidatetargets for therapies for cognitive impairment. This is highly relevant for aging and for aging-relateddisorders such as Alzheimer's Disease and other Alzheimer's disease-related dementias andParkinson's disease.","Acute;Affect;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Area;Attenuated;Behavior;Brain;Brain region;Cognitive;Cognitive aging;Data;Decision Making;Deep Brain Stimulation;Detection;Development;Disease;Elderly;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Essential Tremor;Experimental Designs;Frequencies;Goals;Hospitalization;Human;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Knowledge;Lateral;Location;Maintenance;Medial;Mental Processes;Mentors;Modeling;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Pattern;Population;Positioning Attribute;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevalence;Process;Public Health;Quality of life;Research;Role;Scientist;Testing;Theta Rhythm;Training;age related;aging population;awake;career;cognitive control;cognitive neuroscience;conflict resolution;design;effective therapy;experience;experimental study;frontal lobe;goal oriented behavior;healthy aging;implantation;mortality;motor symptom;neurophysiology;normal aging;novel;novel marker;novel therapeutics;targeted treatment;young adult","Frontal theta as a mechanism of aging-related differences in cognitive control","Project NarrativeCognitive control declines during healthy aging and aging-related diseases such as Parkinson's diseaseAlzheimer's disease and other Alzheimer's disease related dementias.

Restoration of functional and cognitive resilience in early diseasestages is especially beneficial in many aspects as it could substantially extend the period of quality of life anddelay the clinical onset of AD. In search of therapeutic targets for early disease stages recent studies uncovera significant loss of TH+ neurons in locus coeruleus (LC) in patients with MCI and very early stages of AD. Theseneurons project to the hippocampus where monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA) andnorepinephrine (NE) modulate synaptic plasticity and neuronal functions relevant to memory and cognition.Thus restoration of DA and NE levels in the hippocampus could retain cognitive resilience during early stagesof AD. L-DOPA is a brain penetrating precursor drug for DA to treat Parkinsons disease. Its therapeutic potencyon AD has not been well investigated in humans in part due to lack of understanding in the pathologicalinvolvement of DA and NE in AD and development of neurobehavioral side-effects for frequent and long-termuse. We therefore propose to comprehensively evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA by a novel methodof administration in the mouse model recapitulating early stage of AD phenotypes. Unlike the traditional oraladministration of L-DOPA multiple times a day which results in fluctuation of L-DOPA in plasma and inducestoxicity we will give engineered commensal bacteria that produce L-DOPA (EcNrhaL-DOPA) in a sustained and non-pulsatile manner. Single administration of EcNrhaL-DOPA transiently resides in the gut for a couple of days andsupply L-DOPA without disrupting the gut microbiota. This approach could effectively mitigate fluctuation-mediated side-effects and L-DOPA toxicity and maximize its therapeutic effects to restore brain DA and NElevels. As a first step towards evaluating its therapeutic benefits in the relevant AD mouse model we proposeto optimize the treatment regimen and dosage of EcNrhaL-DOPA administration in APP-KI and wildtype mice and toevaluate pharmacokinetics and any adverse toxicological effects in this application. The overall impact andtranslational significance of this proposed study are extremely high as this approach could not only workcomplementally with currently available drugs to treat AD but also significantly slow the progression of ADphenotypes from early stages to prevent conversion to full spectrum of AD.

"Infectious Diseases; Otitis Media; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYAlthough tympanostomy tube (TT or ear tube) placement is a simple and common surgery (754000/year in theUS) complications arise in a subset of patients particularly post-TT otorrhea (PTTO 26%) due to bacterialbiofilms and mucus plugging (7-34%). There is an urgent need to reduce these complications and enhance thefunctional longevity of TTs. Modification of TT surfaces to prevent bacterial adhesion and to reduce mucusadhesion could dramatically reduce these complications. We recently developed a novel photochemicallydriven process that simultaneously forms and grafts zwitterionic thin films onto polymeric materials used tofabricate TTs (e.g. PDMS). These thin films are polymerized from either sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) orcarboxybetaine methacrylate (CBMA) monomers. The CBMA/SBMA polymer chains are crosslinked to eachother during polymerization by polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate (PEGDMA). We find that both CBMA andSBMA thin films prevent adhesion by an order of magnitude from fibrinogen platelets macrophagesfibroblasts and importantly Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We propose to extendthese promising findings into TTs while determining how changes in crosslinking density affect end properties.The overall objective of this research is to determine the ability of zwitterionic thin films grafted onto the surfaceof TTs to prevent the complex phenomena of bacterial colonization and mucus plugging. We hypothesize thatCBMA and SBMA zwitterionic thin films will prevent bacterial adhesion and reduce mucus plugging on TTs. Wewill test this hypothesis by undertaking the following Specific Aims.1) Determine the effect of CBMA and SBMA thin films on bacteria adhesion from Staphylococcus aureus andPseudomonas aeruginosa on TTs. We will test this effect by quantifying bacterial adhesion on PDMS surfacesusing validated in vitro models. We will also expose rats that have been implanted with zwitterionic coated orbare TTs with either S. aureus or P aeruginosa to induce biofilm formation.2) Investigate the ability of CBMA and SBMA thin films to reduce mucus adhesion mucus drying and mucusplug formation on TT surfaces. To test this we will first examine the adhesion and drying of porcine intestinalmucus on PDMS that have been coated with thin films or remain uncoated. Finally we will test the mucusplugging on coated and uncoated TTs inserted into rat tympanic membranes.When successful these aims will implicate a novel and highly effective method to prevent commoncomplications of TTs by preventing biofilm and mucus plug formation.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Health Disparities; Lung; Minority Health; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Project SummaryCystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic disease. Mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductanceregulator (CFTR) gene lead to defective or absent CFTR that is unable to effectively transport anions in manytissues but pulmonary complications are the most common cause of death. Recent advances in CF treatmentinclude drugs able to rescue protein function. However these treatments are mutation-class specific and areineffective for some mutations. Thus there is a persistent need to develop mutation agnostic treatments that canbenefit all people with CF such as gene addition.Lentiviral vectors are well suited for CF gene therapy because they have sufficient carrying capacity and theirability to integrate into the hosts genome ensures long-term benefits. Currently available vectors howeverproduce low vector titers or inefficiently transduce airway epithelial cells from the apical surface. Despite theselimitations treatment of newborn CF pigs with a lentiviral vector carrying a functional copy of CFTR partiallyrescued CF phenotypes suggesting that achieving therapeutic CFTR expression is within reach.My long-term goal is to design a lentiviral vector suitable for the effective treatment of pulmonary CF in humans.The overall objective of his proposal is to evaluate two independent but complementary strategies to improvelentiviral delivery of CFTR to human airway epithelial cells. Lentiviral vectors can accommodate envelopes fromother viruses termed pseudotyping which can lead them to preferentially transduce specific cell types. For thefirst strategy I screened seven viral envelopes and identified two derived from baboon endogenous retrovirus(BaEV) that produce high vector titers and efficiently transduce primary human airway epithelial cells from theapical surface. The second strategy is to increase CFTR expression in transduced cells. Because airwayepithelial cells are electrochemically coupled through gap junctions a few cells expressing high levels of CFTRmay perform sufficient CFTR-mediated anion transport to correct CF phenotypes. Increased gene expressioncan be achieved through codon optimization. I compared three codon optimized CFTR (coCFTR) sequencesand identified one that significantly increases CFTR-mediated transepithelial Cl- transport. My central hypothesisis that increasing transduction efficiency and transgene expression will be sufficient to achieve wild type levelsof CFTR-mediated anion transport. To test my hypothesis I propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determineif BaEV pseudotyped lentiviral vectors can efficiently deliver CFTR to primary human airway epithelial cells and2) Determine if coCFTR delivery reduces the proportion of complemented cells needed to achieve wild typelevels of CFTR-mediated anion transport. These strategies will be tested in vitro using human CF donor-derivedairway epithelia and in vivo using the CF pig model. These experiments will provide valuable preclinical datathat will guide vector design and inform future clinical trials using lentiviral vectors to treat CF.","Address;Adverse effects;Anions;Apical;Basal Cell;Bicarbonates;Bronchi;Carrying Capacities;Cause of Death;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cells;Cellular Stress;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Codon Nucleotides;Complement;Complementary DNA;Coupled;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Dose;Endogenous Retroviruses;Ensure;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;FDA approved;Family suidae;Flow Cytometry;Future;Gap Junctions;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Diseases;Genome;Glycoproteins;Goals;Human;Immunohistochemistry;In Vitro;Infection;Interphase Cell;Lead;Lentivirus Vector;Life;Luciferases;Lung;Measures;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Mutation;Newborn Infant;Papio;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Regulator Genes;Surface;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Trachea;Tropism;Viral;Virus;Work;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;body system;cell type;cellular transduction;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis airway epithelia;cystic fibrosis patients;design;disease-causing mutation;effective therapy;experimental study;gene therapy;gene therapy clinical trial;improved;in vitro testing;in vivo;in vivo Model;porcine model;pre-clinical;progenitor;protein function;receptor;respiratory;transduction efficiency;transgene expression;vector","Advancing lentiviral gene therapy for cystic fibrosis.","Project NarrativeDespite recent advances in cystic fibrosis (CF) drug treatments many people with CF remain without effectivetreatment options for this life-shortening genetic disease.

"Contraception/Reproduction; Genetics; Infertility; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Women's Health","Project summary: Obesity is a global public health issue. A number of chemicals precipitate amenorrheapremature menopause and infertility in females. Affected women experience chronic permanent health effectssince the proportion of their life spent post-menopause is lengthened thereby increasing the likelihood ofassociated health complication development (including coronary heart disease obesity type II diabetesosteoporosis and depression). Reproductive dysfunction also results from obesity and we have published anumber of studies demonstrating that the ovary of an obese female has heightened sensitivity to chemicalexposures that induce ovarian damage and infertility. This increased sensitivity arises from altered abundanceof chemical metabolism proteins within the ovary and raises concern about increased risk to obese women ofenvironmental chemical exposures that target the ovary. Our strong published and preliminary data support that the ovary of obese females have altered chemicalmetabolism in addition to a blunted DNA repair response when exposed to chemicals that cause DNA damage.This is concerning since DNA damage can lead to loss of fertility in females or represent a risk to offspringhealth should this damage be improperly repaired. Indeed offspring of obese women have increased rates ofbirth defects. We have demonstrated our findings in adult post-pubertal mice however whether these impactsare also noted in females who experience an obese environment during gestation or pre-pubertally remainsunclear but represents a major concern for female public health. In light of our strong and worrying evidencefor a heightened sensitivity of the obese female ovary to chemical-induced damage we will mechanisticallyinvestigate our central hypothesis that obesity potentiates ovotoxicity through reduced repair of DNAdamage altered ovarian chemical biotransformation and induction of oxidative stress. We will utilizethe alkylating agent dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to induce ovarian DNA damage at three stages ofimportance in ovarian development; during gestation pre-puberty and post-puberty. We will investigate ourhypothesis through completion of three specific aims: Aim 1 will investigate obesity effects on DNA repairresponse to DMBA exposure; Aim 2 will examine obesity-induced impacts on DMBA chemical metabolism; andAim 3 will determine effects of DMBA exposure and obesity on induction of ovarian oxidative stress.

"Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Contraception/Reproduction; Endocrine Disruptors; Estrogen; Infertility; Nutrition; Pediatric; Women's Health","Global ambient temperatures have steadily increased over the past decades. Increased climate temperatures cause severe extreme incidents such as increased thermal heat causing heat-stress (HS) heat shock and heat exhaustion among mammalian species. European studies show gender differences in which women are more susceptible to death by heatwaves. Likewise in animals female reproduction is compromised by heat- stress induced infertility phenotypically noted as anovulation reduced conception rate and low pregnancy maintenance. Resembling metabolic disorders such as obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) animals during HS are hyperinsulinemic and our research group have discovered that HS alters ovarian insulin signaling and steroid hormone production. In mammalian species various compounds alter endocrine signaling disrupting endogenous hormonal production. Such an endocrine disruptor is a dietary contaminant zearalenone which acts as a non-steroidal estrogen to impair female reproduction. Human exposure has been identified in the European Food Authority; however such is not established in the United States. In a different physiological model of hyperinsulinemia obesity the ovary becomes more sensitive to environmental ovotoxic exposures. Specifically Ms. Roach will explore the hypothesis that ZEA exposure alters ovarian signaling and that heat stress is additive to ZEA-induced ovotoxicity. A pig animal model will be used since both pigs and humans have similar sensitivities to ZEA exposure and two specific aims will be completed. Aim 1 will determine the phenotypic and endocrine impacts of ZEA exposure during HS. Aim 2 will determine if exposure to ZEA during HS alters ovarian histomorphology and pathways involved in folliculogenesis insulin signaling steroidogenesis and apoptosis. Collectively these experiments will determine a comprehensive understanding of phenotypic and molecular effects of ZEA and HS exposures alone and in combination. In addition this fellowship will expand Mrs. Roach's technical and intellectual competencies by providing her with additional scientific and didactic training to enhance her career development under the mentorship of an expert in reproductive physiology and toxicology. This is a niche and emerging area of toxicology that will position Ms. Roach to be at the forefront of the intersection between climate change and toxicology. In all this proposal will support the research and career development training of Ms. Crystal Roach in the Department of Animal Science at Iowa State University under the sponsorship of Dr. Aileen Keating.","1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Adolescent;Adult;Animal Model;Animals;Anovulation;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;Barley;Biological;Body Temperature;Body Weight;Cardiovascular system;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Climate;Competence;Conceptions;Crystallization;Data;Development;Endocrine;Endocrine Disruptors;Endocrine disruption;Endotoxemia;Environmental Health;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Estradiol;Estrogens;Estrus;Europe;European;Event;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Family suidae;Fellowship;Female;Female infertility;Fertility;Food;Food Contamination;Fusarium;Goals;Health;Heat Exhaustion;Heat Stress Disorders;Heat Waves;Heat-Shock Response;Hormonal;Human;Hyperinsulinism;Impairment;Infertility;Insulin;Intake;Intestines;Investigation;Iowa;Italy;Link;Malnutrition;Measures;Mentors;Mentorship;Messenger RNA;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mycotoxins;NOEL;Non-Steroidal Estrogens;Nuts;Obesity;Oral;Ovarian;Ovary;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiological;Planets;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome;Population;Positioning Attribute;Precocious Puberty;Pregnancy Maintenance;Production;Prolactin;Proteins;Proteomics;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;Reproduction;Reproductive Physiology;Research;Research Support;Respiration;Science;Serum;Signal Transduction;Steroid biosynthesis;Structure;Temperature;Time;Toddler;Toxicant exposure;Toxicology;Training;United States;Universities;Vector-transmitted infectious disease;Weather;Western Blotting;Wheat;Woman;Zearalenone;absorption;adverse outcome;authority;base;career development;climate change;climate impact;contaminated water;dietary;estrogenic;experience;experimental study;exposed human population;extreme weather;female fertility;folliculogenesis;gender difference;girls;improved;insulin signaling;mortality;novel;ovotoxicant;ovotoxicity;physiologic model;prepuberty;reproductive function;research and development;respiratory;steroid hormone;stressor","Investigating additive impact of heat stress on zearalenone-induced ovotoxicity","Heat stress as a consequence of climate change negatively impairs female reproduction.

"Aging; Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention; Sarcopenia","Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a widespread metabolic disorder that is characterized by insulin resistanceand hyperglycemia. Obesity the excess accumulation of fat mass is a major T2D risk factor and is stronglyassociated with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and liver resulting in less glucose uptake by both organs.Reduced muscle glucose uptake contributes to chronic hyperglycemia and is further exacerbated by excessivehepatic gluconeogenesis. Because skeletal muscle is the largest tissue depot available for glucose disposalsarcopenia the loss of skeletal muscle mass also contributes to hyperglycemia. Though obesity andsarcopenia are key factors that contribute to the pathogenesis of T2D current therapies address insulinavailability or sensitivity without addressing the underlying imbalance between fat and muscle mass. Disruption of the skeletal muscle mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) increases insulin sensitivity andaccelerates fat loss with complete muscle mass sparing in mice recovering from obesity. Thus modulatingskeletal muscle pyruvate metabolism may be useful for treating altered body composition as a T2D root cause.Our previous work has focused on understanding how muscle-specific MPC disruption increases fat oxidation.However how skeletal muscle MPC disruption maintains lean mass during fat mass loss is still not understood.Therefore the overall goal of this proposal is to understand how disrupting skeletal muscle mitochondrialpyruvate uptake spares muscle mass during recovery from obesity. Based on our preliminary data the centralhypothesis of this proposal is that muscle MPC disruption leads to muscle mass sparing during recovery fromobesity through: 1) a whole-body mechanism of altered substrate exchange between muscle and liver thatspares nitrogen for muscle mass; and 2) a unique MPC disruption-dependent muscle-autonomousmechanism of nitrogen retention. Experiments for specific aim 1 will test the hypothesis that muscle MPCdisruption increases Cori Cycling the exchange of lactate and glucose between muscle and liver which sparesnitrogen for skeletal muscle protein and amino acid synthesis during weight loss and recovery from obesity.Experiments for specific aim 2 will test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle MPC disruption increases aspartateand branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) availability that leads to maintenance of myocellular protein content.This research is significant because completion will provide mechanistic information on a way to alter skeletalmuscle metabolism that may inform treatment of obesity and sarcopenia contributing to T2D. This research isnovel because it addresses new concepts in cellular and systemic nitrogen handling.","Acids;Acute;Address;Affect;Age;Alanine;Amino Acids;Anabolism;Aspartate;Body Composition;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Branched-Chain Amino Acids;Cell Culture Techniques;Chronic;Citric Acid Cycle;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Disease Outcome;Excretory function;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fellowship;Generations;Genetic;Glucose;Glycolysis;Goals;Health;Hyperglycemia;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Intervention;Knock-out;Knowledge;Label;Link;Liver;Maintenance;Measurement;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Mission;Mitochondria;Modeling;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Fibers;Muscle Mitochondria;Muscle Proteins;Muscular Atrophy;Nitrogen;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Organ;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Patients;Physicians;Plant Roots;Production;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Puromycin;Pyruvate;Pyruvate Metabolism Pathway;Recovery;Research;Risk Factors;Scientist;Skeletal Muscle;Testing;Thinness;Tissues;Training;Transfer RNA Aminoacylation;United States National Institutes of Health;Weight;Wild Type Mouse;Work;amino acid metabolism;base;career;diabetes pathogenesis;experimental study;glucose disposal;glucose uptake;hepatic gluconeogenesis;improved;insulin sensitivity;muscle form;nitrogen balance;novel;obesity treatment;oxidation;polypeptide;preservation;prevent;pyruvate carrier;sarcopenia;skeletal muscle metabolism;skeletal muscle wasting;stable isotope;uptake","Muscle Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier Disruption Alters Amino Acid Metabolism to Maintain Muscle Mass During Recovery from Obesity","Project NarrativeThe proposed research addresses the major public health issue of obesity during Type 2Diabetes.

"Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Estrogen; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases; Women's Health","Project Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases worldwide. Despite a large numberof available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) more than one-third of people with epilepsy are not able tocontrol their seizures with medication putting them at higher risk for sudden unexpected death inepilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is a major cause of death in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy andwhile it is distributed across all ages and affects both males and females it is more prevalent inmales. In some epileptic females seizure frequency and severity are known to uctuatecorresponding to changes in sex steroid levels. Possibly sex steroids play a role in the regulation ofseizures and might account for the sex difference in SUDEP incidence.To evaluate the role of sex steroids in seizure and SUDEP susceptibility we used acute and chronictreatment of progesterone and estradiol (P+E) in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) with aScn1aR1407X/+ loss-of-function mutation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that SUDEP incidenceand the seizure phenotype are improved in female and male mice acutely treated with P+E. Defectsin the serotonin (5-HT) system and decits in GABAergic function are associated with seizures andSUDEP. Animal studies have shown that acute and chronic treatment with P+E can increase 5-HTconcentration in the brain and increase tonic GABA inhibition in the hippocampus. Further sexsteroids are known to stimulate breathing potentially providing a method to rescue the respiratoryphenotype observed in DS mice. Thus we will test the working hypotheses that 1) P+E decreaseSUDEP incidence by reducing seizure frequency and/or severity and stimulating breathing and 2)the anticonvulsant effects of P+E are mediated by serotonin and/or GABA. The effect of chronic andacute P+E treatment on seizures SUDEP incidence and breathing will be assessed through video-EEG/EKG monitoring of spontaneous and hyperthermia-induced seizures. Using DS mice in which 5-HT neurons have been genetically deleted I will determine whether serotonin mediates theanticonvulsant effects conferred by acute and chronic P+E treatment. Lastly I will assess fordifferences in GABA-A mediated tonic inhibition in the hippocampal slice of DS mice compared to wildtype with and without acute application of P+E or their metabolites using whole-cell patch-clamprecordings. The proposed work will provide clearer insight into the role of sex steroids in SUDEPincidence. Further as sex differences in seizure susceptibility are a widespread concern in epilepsyidentifying how sex steroids impact the serotonergic and GABAergic neural pathways could provideclinicians with more effective treatment strategies for both male and female epilepsy patients.","Acute;Affect;Age;Allopregnanolone;Animal Model;Animals;Anticonvulsants;Antiepileptic Agents;Blood;Brain;Breathing;Cause of Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Chronic;Data;Defect;Electrocardiogram;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Estradiol;Estrogens;Female;Frequencies;GABA-A Receptor;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Incidence;Induced Hyperthermia;Intractable Epilepsy;Investigation;Knowledge;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Play;Population;Predisposition;Progesterone;Regulation;Research Proposals;Respiration Disorders;Risk;Rodent;Role;Seizures;Serotonergic System;Serotonin;Severities;Sex Differences;Signal Transduction;Slice;Testing;Tidal Volume;Up-Regulation;Whole Body Plethysmography;Wild Type Mouse;Woman;Work;design;dravet syndrome;effective therapy;experience;experimental study;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;high risk;improved;insight;loss of function mutation;male;mortality;mouse model;nervous system disorder;patch clamp;prevent;protective effect;respiratory;sex;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy;treatment strategy;ventilation","Sex differences in SUDEP susceptibility: the role of progesterone and estradiol","Project NarrativeMales have a higher incidence of epilepsy and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy(SUDEP) compared to females.

"Health Disparities; Minority Health; Wound Healing and Care","PROJECT SUMMARY Over 70 million surgeries are performed in the United States annually. Although many wounds heal withoutproblem half require postsurgical wound care. Wounds that do not heal affect about 7 million people annuallyand generate treatment costs of about $100 billion which creates a significant financial burden on the USeconomy. Increasing our understanding of the molecular pathways regulating wound healing would enhancetissue repair and reduce healthcare costs. Our long-term goal is to identify molecular pathways regulating tissue repair. We previously demonstratedthat the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) is required for proper wound healing by actingas a master regulator of keratinocyte differentiation proliferation and collective cell migration. Our recentpreliminary data show that Irf6-deficient keratinocytes have weaker cell-cell adhesion and reduced membranelocalization of adherens junction components including E-cadherin providing a potential rationale for the IRF6-dependent keratinocyte migration defect. Interestingly our preliminary data also revealed that total adherensjunction protein levels were not changed suggesting a non-transcriptional function of IRF6 in these processes. IRF6 as a member of the Interferon regulatory transcription factor family contains a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a less conserved protein interaction domain. Most of IRF6 describedfunctions have been associated with its transcriptional activity and very little is known about the functions of itsprotein interaction domain. Particularly which domain of IRF6 contributes to cell-cell adhesions required forwound healing is unknown. Our central hypothesis is that IRF6 promotes collective cell migration via a non-transcriptional regulation of cell-cell adhesion molecules at the cytoplasmic membrane. We will test our centralhypothesis with the execution of two aims. In Aim 1 we will determine how IRF6 regulates E-cadherin trafficking.In Aim 2 we will determine how IRF6 promotes collective cell migration. To test our hypothesis using a widerange of biochemical and cellular assays we will take advantage of multiple IRF6 mutant lines to determinewhich domains of this transcription factor are required for regulating cell adhesions.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","Project SummaryMultiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS).Increasing evidence indicates that the inhibition of remyelination is a major cause of the permanentneurodegeneration. However the precise mechanism that inhibits OPCs differentiation and remyelinationremains an active area of research. While inflammation-associated NOTCH1 activation was implicated indefective remyelination in MS the precise mechanism by which NOTCH1 was engaged during inflammatoryresponse remains elusive. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) an animal model of MSwe and others have established that IL-17 signaling is crucial for the induction of inflammation in the CNS. Wehave now discovered a direct integration of IL-17 and NOTCH1 signaling that plays a dominant role in impairingthe differentiation of OPCs. IL-17 stimulation induced the release of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 (NICD1)in the OPCs co-cultured with astrocytes. Mechanistically IL-17R interacts with NOTCH1 via the extracellulardomain which facilitates the cleavage of NICD1. Subsequently Act1 the adaptor protein for IL-17 signalingforms a complex with NICD1 followed by translocation of Act1-NICD1 complex into the nucleus. Act1-NICD1complex promotes the assembly of RBP-J containing transcriptional complex on the promoters of NOTCH1target genes implicated in CNS inflammation. Furthermore a decoy peptide disrupting the IL-17RANOTCH1interaction inhibited IL-17-induced NICD cleavage reduced IL-17-induced OPC prolifereation and attenuatedthe myelin loss in EAE model. Based on these findings we hypothesize IL-17-NOTCH1 pathway drives theexpression of a specific set of genes to promote inflammation and inhibition of OPC differentiation therebyimpairing the remyelination process in the demyelinating disease. We will test this hypothesis through Aim 1:Investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory role of IL-17-NOTCH1 integration on OPC differentiation.Aim 2: Investigate the in vivo impact of IL-17-NOTCH1 integration on remyelination process. The completion ofthis proposal will provide fundamental insight into the critical integration of signaling pathways of IL-17 andNOTCH1 which underlies the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease offering novel therapeutic strategies forMS patients by promoting remyelination.","Ablation;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Adult;Affect;Animal Model;Area;Astrocytes;Attenuated;Brain;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Nucleus;Cell Proliferation;Chronic;Complex;Cuprizone;Data;Demyelinating Diseases;Demyelinations;Disease model;Environment;Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis;Extracellular Domain;Genes;Genetic Transcription;IL17 Signaling Pathway;Impairment;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-17;Knock-in Mouse;Link;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Multiple Sclerosis;Multiple Sclerosis Lesions;Mus;Myelin;NOTCH1 gene;Nerve Degeneration;Neuraxis;Neurologic Deficit;Nuclear;Oligodendroglia;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptides;Phase;Play;Process;Proliferating;Research;Role;Signal Transduction;Slice;Spinal Cord;Structure-Activity Relationship;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic;United States;Work;base;cell type;central nervous system demyelinating disorder;chromatin immunoprecipitation;cytokine;improved;in vivo;injury and repair;insight;multiple sclerosis patient;notch protein;novel therapeutic intervention;oligodendrocyte progenitor;programs;promoter;receptor;remyelination;six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 4;standard care;stem cell proliferation;stem cells;ubiquitin-protein ligase","THE INTEGRATION OF IL-17 AND NOTCH SIGNALING IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF CNS INFLAMMATION","Project Narrative:Multiple Sclerosis (MS) afflicts approximately 400000 people in the United States and millionsmore across the world.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYFungal diseases affect an estimated 300 million people a year and lead to approximately 1.6 million deaths.Despite the high prevalence of serious fungal diseases no area of infectious disease drug development hasmade less progress in the last fifty years than mycology. Of the three primary classes of drugs used to treatinvasive fungal infections (IFIs) amphotericin B was introduced in the 1950s; azoles were developed in the1970s; and the echinocandins were approved in 2002. Unfortunately this slow rate of progress is not becausethese drugs are highly effective. Indeed the mortality rates for invasive candidiasis invasive aspergillosis andcryptococcal meningitis three of the most common IFIs remain unacceptably high at 30-40% 50% and>50% respectively. Furthermore the poor outcomes associated with IFIs are likely to worsen as the incidenceof antifungal drug resistance continues to rise. Accordingly the clear consensus in the field is that novelclasses of antifungal drugs represent one of the most pressing un-met clinical needs facing infectious disease.One approach to expediting this development is to optimize the antifungal activity of drugs currently used totreat other diseases. The phenothiazine class of molecules related to antipsychotic and antiemetic medicationshas been shown by us and others to have antifungal properties. In preliminary studies toward optimizing thesecompounds we have been able to increase their antifungal activity and decrease their affinity forneurotransmitter receptors the prime driver of dose limiting side effects. Here we propose a hit-to-leaddevelopment of these phenothiazines focusing on structure guided reduction in dopamine/serotonin receptoractivity and reducing multi drug efflux affinity. Our goal is to advance 3-4 molecules into initial animal efficacystudies. To achieve these goals we propose the following aims: 1) medicinal chemistry-based optimization ofthe antifungal therapeutic index of the phenothiazine scaffold; 2) characterize the mechanism of increased anti-candidal activity of novel fluphenazine and trifluoperazine derivatives; and 3) in vivo pharmacology and efficacytesting of three lead candidates using murine infection models.","Adopted;Affect;Affinity;Amphotericin B;Anti-Infective Agents;Antiemetics;Antifungal Agents;Antifungal Therapy;Antipsychotic Agents;Area;Aspergillosis;Aspergillus;Azole resistance;Azoles;Biological Assay;Biological Availability;Candida;Candida albicans;Candida auris;Candidiasis;Central Nervous System Infections;Cessation of life;Clinical;Coccidioides;Communicable Diseases;Consensus;Cryptococcal Meningitis;Cryptococcus;Cryptococcus neoformans;Data;Development;Disease;Disseminated candidiasis;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;Dose;Dose-Limiting;Drug Efflux;Drug usage;Fluphenazine;Fungal Drug Resistance;Fusarium;Goals;Grant;High Prevalence;Histoplasma;Human;Incidence;Industrial fungicide;Infection;Lead;Life;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucor;Multi-Drug Resistance;Mus;Mycoses;National Institute of Mental Health;Neurotransmitter Receptor;Oral;Organ;Outcome;Parents;Patients;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pharmacopoeias;Phase II Clinical Trials;Phenothiazines;Polyenes;Property;Psychotropic Drugs;Publishing;Pump;Resistance;Structure;Testing;The science of Mycology;Therapeutic Index;Trifluoperazine;animal efficacy;base;drug candidate;drug development;echinocandin resistance;efficacy study;efficacy testing;efflux pump;experimental study;fungus;human model;improved;in vivo;lead candidate;lead optimization;mortality;mouse model;neurotransmitter antagonist;novel;novel therapeutics;pathogenic fungus;pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics;preclinical development;resistant strain;scaffold;screening program;serotonin receptor;side effect","Hit-to-lead optimization of broad spectrum antifungal phenothiazines","PROJECT NARRATIVEFungal infections affect an estimated 300 million people annually causing considerable morbidity and mortalityaround the globe.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases","ABSTRACTPathogen-specific functionally distinct subsets of CD4 helper T cells including T follicular helper (Tfh) and Thelper type 1 (Th1) subsets are critical for orchestrating the induction and maturation of innate and adaptiveimmune responses. Proper genetic programming of Tfh and Th1 differentiation is required for regulating immuneresponses to clear primary infections and promote long-lived memory CD4 T cell-mediated protection againstpathogen re-exposures. Genetic approaches to study CD4 T cell differentiation have been largely focused ontranscriptional programming but gene regulation is also critically tied to epigenetic modifications whichrepresents a major knowledge gap in our understanding of CD4 T cell biology. In this project the applicant willinvestigate the role of Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) family members in the formation and function of effectorand memory Th1 and Tfh cell subsets. New preliminary data show substantial CD4 T cell developmental skewingtowards Tfh fates in the absence of specific TET family members. The goals of this project are to use conditionalgenetic and chimeric approaches coupled with robust systems of infectious disease immunology to establishfundamentally new and mechanistic understanding of the role and function of epigenetic programming ingoverning Tfh and Th1 CD4 cell fate. The first set of objectives are to evaluate the function CD4 T cells lackingspecific TET family members. The second set of objectives are to study the molecular genetic mechanismsgoverning CD4 T cell differentiation. At the successful completion of the proposed research the applicant willhave acquired skillsets that involve the generation and analysis of high-dimensional data sets undertaken in anintellectually and scientifically rich environment of intensive and interdisciplinary mentorship.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Regenerative Medicine; Transplantation","Project Summary/Abstract:Large bone defects are clincially challenging to treat and often necessitate bone grafting. Natural graftingoptions include autografts and allografts; however these replacement tissues are limited in supply and difficultto match to the dimensional irregularities of complex bone defects. The development of tissue-engineered (TE)synthetic grafts has become essential to overcome the limitations of natural grafts; however deficient scaffoldfabrication methods and inefficient osteoinductive agents have prevented the clinical translation of traditionalTE constructs. Therefore the design of advanced synthetic grafts that overcome these limitations wouldgreatly impact the clinical treatment of large bone defects. The long-term goal of this proposed work is todevelop biodegradable 3D-printed constructs with osteoconductive and inductive properties toward clinical usefor the treatment of patient-specific bone defects. The objective of this proposal aims to develop a TE constructfor bone regeneration using a hybrid materials approach that includes both synthetic and natural polymers inthe 3D-printed structure combined with the sustained release of osteoinductive microRNAs. Advanced TEconstructs for this investigation will combine 3D-printable FDA-approved polymers with tunable biodegradationrates with natural polymer coatings to sustain the release of osteoinductive microRNAs. The central hypothesisof this work is that the sustained release of osteoinductive microRNAs from polymer-coated 3D-printedconstructs will enhance the osteogenic capabilities of synthetic grafts by prolonging regenerative signaling tomaximize bone regeneration. To test this hypothesis we will characterize microRNA release from polymer-coated 3D-printed constructs (Aim 1) assess in vitro osteogenic differentiation induced by microRNA releasefrom polymer-coated constructs (Aim 2) and evaluate the bone regeneration potential of polymer-coatedmicroRNA-incorporated 3D-printed constructs (Aim 3). Collectively these data with elucidate mechanisms inwhich microRNA release from polymer-coated 3D-printed scaffolds can be optimized to sustain the release ofosteoinductive signals and maximize bone regeneration. These results will advance the development ofsynthetic TE constructs to include both osteoconductive and inductive properties that will effectively promotebone regeneration and thus significantly impact the clinical treatment of challenging patient-specific bonedefects.","3-Dimensional;3D Print;Advanced Development;Adverse effects;Allografting;Architecture;Autologous Transplantation;Biocompatible Materials;Biodegradation;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Biomedical Engineering;Bone Development;Bone Morphogenetic Proteins;Bone Regeneration;Bone Transplantation;Calvaria;Cell Differentiation process;Cell-Matrix Junction;Cells;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Complex;Data;Defect;Development;Dimensions;Dose;Essential Genes;Extracellular Matrix;FDA approved;Family;Fellowship;Gelatin;Gene Expression;Goals;Growth;Hybrids;Implant;In Vitro;Infiltration;Investigation;Medicine;Methods;MicroRNAs;Nuclear;Nutrient;Organ Transplantation;Orthopedics;Osteogenesis;Patients;Polymers;Porosity;Positioning Attribute;Production;Property;Proteins;Rattus;Research;Research Training;Signal Transduction;Stains;Structure;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;Transcript;Work;bone;bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell;bone metabolism;caprolactone;cell motility;clinical application;clinical translation;clinically relevant;crosslink;density;design;in vivo;in vivo regeneration;individualized medicine;innovation;insight;member;migration;multidisciplinary;new technology;novel;osteogenic;prevent;regeneration potential;regenerative;replacement tissue;restoration;scaffold","Bone Regeneration Induced by the Sustained Release of Osteoinductive microRNAs from 3D-printed Constructs","Project Narrative:Clinical application of tissue-engineered synthetic grafts for treating large bone defects requires thedevelopment of advanced constructs that combine 3D-printing technologies osteoconductive scaffoldingmaterials and potent osteoinductive agents.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Disparities; Kidney Disease; Minority Health; Social Determinants of Health","PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARYEach year over 120000 individuals are diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States(US). Approximately 97% of those individuals begin using dialysis as their method of renal replacementtherapy. The options for dialysis in the US are in-center hemodialysis home hemodialysis and peritonealdialysis. Home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are considered forms of self-care dialysis (SCD) and areassociated with benefits such as improved survival rates greater control over treatment scheduling reducedtime in hospitals and clinics higher quality of life and financial savings. Despite these benefits uptake of SCDhas been minimal compared to in-center hemodialysis. Previous interventions and clinical recommendationsaimed at improving the dialysis modality decision-making process have primarily focused on factors at theindividual and interpersonal level. Our objective is to identify distinguishing individual interpersonalorganizational and policy factors that facilitated selection of SCD and in-center hemodialysis and thengeneralize these differences in a greater sample of patients with ESRD. To do this we will conduct a mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) sequential exploratory approach. We will achieve these goals with thefollowing objectives: 1) Determine the knowledge attitudes and beliefs of patients currently undergoingdialysis for ESRD regarding the different dialysis options as well as the experiences with the decision-makingprocess using interviews with questions and prompts informed by the social ecological model and 2)Generalize and validate the findings from Phase 1 and test hypotheses generated based on Phase 1 resultsto understand dialysis modality choices using survey data from patients undergoing dialysis. In Phase 1 wewill conduct qualitative interviews with a diverse population of patients undergoing dialysis and ask them toreflect retrospectively on their experiences leading up to dialysis initiation. Results will shed light on whetherpatients had the opportunity and/or enough time to undergo a decision-making process what circumstancesallowed them to do so or not and what specific personal preferences and values helped shape their decision.Additionally these findings will inform Phase 2 hypotheses and study materials. Phase 2 will validate andcorroborate Phase 1 findings using survey data in a larger sample of patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis.Pre-selected survey items will assess sociodemographic and psychological characteristics health behaviorsclinical factors interpersonal relationships access to healthcare prior to ESRD and previous experiences withhealthcare. In both phases we will recruit participants from diverse racial/ethnic regional and socio-economicbackgrounds as well as varying lengths of time on dialysis. Outcomes from this proposal will be significant byrevealing what factors and at which social-ecological levels should be targeted for future clinical interventionsto 1) ensure patients are choosing a dialysis modality that is appropriate for them and 2) increase the numberof eligible patients selecting SCD methods so they may enjoy the associated health and quality of life benefits.","Address;Adult;Attitude;Belief;Caring;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinics and Hospitals;Data;Decision Making;Development;Diagnosis;Dialysis patients;Dialysis procedure;Education;End stage renal failure;Ensure;Foundations;Future;Goals;Health;Health behavior;Health care facility;Healthcare;Hemodialysis;Home;Home Hemodialysis;Individual;Interpersonal Relations;Intervention;Interview;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Length;Life;Life Style;Light;Methods;Modality;Modeling;Organizational Policy;Outcome;Participant;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Peritoneal Dialysis;Personality;Phase;Population Heterogeneity;Process;Psychosocial Factor;Publishing;Quality of life;Recommendation;Renal Replacement Therapy;Research Personnel;Sampling;Savings;Self Care;Shapes;Solid;Structure;Surveys;Survival Rate;Time;Treatment Protocols;United States;Universities;base;experience;health care availability;health care delivery;improved;insight;overtreatment;patient population;phase 1 testing;preference;psychologic;public health intervention;racial and ethnic;racial diversity;recruit;renal damage;social;sociodemographics;socioeconomics;uptake","Dialysis Modality Decision Making in Adults with ESRD","PROJECT NARRATIVEFor people with end-stage renal disease there are multiple treatment modalities to choose from includingdialysis which is the most popular form of renal replacement therapy; however in-center dialysis isoverwhelmingly chosen over forms of self-care dialysis even though evidence suggests there are many morepatients who are eligible for self-care dialysis methods than actually utilize them.

Consequentlyonly 20% of individuals with schizophrenia can work. Cognitive deficits are also seen in early course minimallytreated patients and first-degree relatives. Recent studies point to sleep spindle abnormalities as a target forimproving cognitive function in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia have a specific deficit in sleepspindles that is associated with impaired memory consolidation and symptom severity. Sleep spindle deficitsare seen in non-psychotic first-degree relatives and antipsychotic nave first episode patients and constitutean endophenotype that (i) predates the onset of SZ (ii) persists throughout its course and (iii) contributes tocognitive deficits and symptoms. Sleep spindles are rapid bursts of 12-15 Hz EEG activity characteristic ofStage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep that are generated and regulated by the thalamic reticular nucleus(TRN) and related thalamocortical circuitry. Another endophenotype of SZ sensory gating is also regulated byTRN circuitry. The TRN by gating the flow of information from the thalamus to the cortex attenuates thetransmission of redundant and irrelevant sensory stimuli and thereby protects higher cognitive function frominterference. Patients with SZ and their first-degree relatives exhibit sensory gating deficits that correlate withcognitive function and symptom severity. The goal of the present study is to determine whether sleep spindlesand sensory gating are associated with the same underlying TRN mediated thalamocortical communicationabnormality in schizophrenia and predict memory consolidation deficits and symptom severity.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)","There are significant advantages from translating genome sequences into proteins where there is a large bodyof accumulated knowledge regarding their relationships among sequence structure and function. Advances ingenome sequencing are producing a deluge of data that can be used to train and test prediction methods toidentify the characteristics of various mutants by building atop the large functional protein data. Cliniciansneed to know the functional behavior of mutants - whether they are neutral or deleterious - whether they affectprotein structure  whether they affect protein dynamics - whether they affect protein binding specificity.Protein structures have local environments for each amino acid in the sequence and usually amino acids ateach position are compatible with their local environment. This leads to strongly correlated amino acids asmanifested in the multiple sequence alignments. This project will combine protein sequence and structure datatogether with amino acid properties and their correlations to characterize each site in the protein structure toinvestigate the hypothesis that outliers in the distributions over the important amino acid properties for eachposition will negatively impact functionality i.e. they will be deleterious mutants. The project will drill downdeeply to learn what is the nature of the impaired mechanism. Two diverse approaches will be taken in the twoaims: Aim 1 will investigate the amino acid property distributions to identify the properties that best characterizeeach position in the sequence and structure and determine how the outliers negatively impact the functionalstructures dynamics and binding characteristics. Preliminary results show that the deleterious mutants usuallyhave a significantly broader range of single amino acid properties for the deleterious mutants. Data from theseanalyses will be fed into Aim 2 where two type of machine learning approaches  Extreme Learning Machinesand Random Forests will be jointly applied. Preliminary results show that incorporating just one amino acidproperty yields significant gains over existing methods. One of the major strengths of this project is that resultsfrom the two Aims will be exchanged frequently to achieve improved predictions for both approaches. Theproject builds on the long experience of the PIs in datamining from protein structures and sequences as wellas previous machine learning applications. Important potential outcomes include a more reliable moreinformed understanding of how mutants affect function. In addition the project aims to predict connections ofmutants to specific diseases. The results of the project will be important for drug development because thespecific part of the protein where function is impaired will be identified to allow drug developers to narrow theirfocus onto more limited parts of a protein that is targeted for drug design. The predictors established by thisproject will also have the potential to screen for large numbers of previously unknown mutations that could beused to identify specific regions of a protein structure susceptible to further disease-related mutations.","Adverse effects;Affect;Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acid Substitution;Amino Acids;Artificial Intelligence;Back;Behavior;Binding;Binding Proteins;Binding Sites;Cell physiology;Characteristics;Clinical;Complex;Computer software;Data;Data Analyses;Databases;Detection;Disease;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;Environment;Family;Foundations;Future;Genetic Variation;Genome;Gold;Impairment;Individual;Knowledge;Learning;Literature;Machine Learning;Methods;Missense Mutation;Molecular;Mutation;Nature;Normal Range;Organism;Outcome;Output;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Positioning Attribute;Probability;Property;Protein Dynamics;Proteins;Quantitative Evaluations;Reporting;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Sequence Alignment;Severities;Site;Solid;Specificity;Structure;Testing;Training;Translating;Ursidae Family;Variant;base;cost;data mining;design;disease phenotype;drug development;experience;genome sequencing;human disease;improved;individual patient;individualized medicine;innovation;large datasets;machine learning algorithm;mutant;novel;protein function;protein structure;protein structure prediction;random forest;screening;tool;user friendly software","Novel Use of Genome Information to Understand Mutations","Individualized medicine in the future will need to know exactly what specific mechanisms areaffected by each individual disease mutant.

"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","Flaviviruses include many serious pathogens such as Zika dengue West Nile and yellow fever viruses. In infected cells these viruses produce abundant noncoding short flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) that comprise most of the ~500 nucleotide 3 untranslated region of the viral genome. These novel viral RNAs have been shown recently to interact with numerous host proteins and inhibit translation (protein synthesis) of certain genes of the innate immune system. Thus virus strains that produce high levels of sfRNA are more pathogenic and mutants that produce no sfRNA are so mild as to be promising vaccine candidates. However a picture of how sfRNA globally affects translation of cellular mRNAs is lacking. The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic of 2014-16 resulted in frighteningly frequent cases of microcephaly and other developmental and neurological disorders caused by exposure to ZIKV in utero. In addition to inhibiting the immune response ZIKV sfRNA inhibits Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) a key translational regulator of neurological development. Thus this knowledge of the global effects of ZIKV sfRNA on host translation could contribute to future research on understanding how this virus manipulates the host and causes disease. Method: We will employ the transformative method of ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to sample the level of translation across the entire population of mRNAs in the cell in order to identify genes that are translationally up- or down-regulated in the presence of sfRNA either alone or in the context of replicating ZIKV. RiboSeq - a modification of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNAseq) - reveals only the fragments of mRNAs that are protected by translating ribosomes. The number of reads of ribosome-protected fragments from a given mRNA is proportional to how actively that mRNA is translated. This highly informative method has been applied only sparingly to flaviviruses and to our knowledge never to determine specifically the effects of sfRNA a known translational regulator. We will also develop new statistical methods to improve on current imperfect approaches for calculating significance of changes in translational efficiency of mRNAs in response to a treatment. Finally we will use a variety of bioinformatics tools to identify common structural features of mRNAs whose translation efficiencies are similarly affected by sfRNA. Expected Outcomes. Identification of genes whose translation is affected by sfRNAs will reveal potential genes and genetic pathways that facilitate - or defend against  ZIKV infection. These can be the focus of future studies by us and others to determine their role and regulation in virus infection the immune response or possibly neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover these results may reveal new ways of regulating translation. This research can benefit human health by informing rational design of vaccines or antivirals targeting ZIKV and other flaviviruses and by providing better understanding of control of protein synthesis by RNA.","3&apos; Untranslated Regions;5&apos; Untranslated Regions;Address;Affect;Americas;Antiviral Agents;Basic Science;Binding;Cell Line;Cell Nucleus;Cell physiology;Cells;Clinical Trials;Data Analyses;Dengue;Dengue Virus;Detection;Development;Disease;Epidemic;Exposure to;FMR1;Fetus;Flavivirus;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic;Genome;HIV;Health;Host Defense;Human;Immune response;Infection;Innate Immune System;Integration Host Factors;Interferons;Invaded;Knowledge;Messenger RNA;Methods;Microcephaly;Modification;Molecular;Mothers;Natural Immunity;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurologic;Nucleotides;Outcome;Parasites;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Polyribosomes;Population;Positioning Attribute;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;RNA chemical synthesis;RNA replication;Regulation;Research;Ribosomes;Role;Sampling;Severity of illness;Specific qualifier value;Statistical Methods;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Transcript;Transfection;Translating;Translational Regulation;Translations;Untranslated RNA;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Viral Genome;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;West Nile virus;Yellow fever virus;ZIKA;ZIKV infection;Zika Virus;bioinformatics tool;developmental disease;female reproductive system;genomic RNA;immunoregulation;improved;in utero;mRNA sequencing;mutant;neonatal infection;nervous system disorder;novel;pathogen;response;ribosome profiling;tool;transcriptome sequencing;vaccine candidate;vector mosquito;viral RNA;viral genomics;virology","Global effects of flavivirus sfRNA on translation determined by ribosome profiling","The severity of disease caused by flaviviruses such as Zika dengue and West Nile virus is controlled at least in part by a small flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) derived from the viral genome. sfRNA counteracts host antiviral defenses and may inhibit translation (protein synthesis) of host genes involved in key cellular processes including innate immunity.

Alzheimers disease(AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and accounts for up to 80% of all dementiadiagnoses. Currently there is no cure for AD. Thus there is an urgent need for novel interventions that canprevent onset and slow the disease progression thereby improving the quality of life in the elderly.Apolipoprotein E4 allele (ApoE4) is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for AD and represents 60% of ADsubjects in the general population yet we do not fully understand how it causes dementia. ApoE protein iscritical for lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport. The other known risk factors for AD include older agefemale gender and hypertension. Our robust preliminary data obtained from the human ApoE4-knockin (E4)and ApoE3-knockin (E3) mice demonstrates that compared to the males female E4 mice develop cognitivedecline and hypertension with aging. Notably we find CSF levels of angiotensin II (AngII) the excitatorycomponent of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) progressively increase with age in the female E4mice. It is now becoming evident that the proinflammatory actions of AngII damage the blood-brain-barrier andincrease amyloid-b and tau load causing neurotoxicity in spatial learning and memory region of the brain thehippocampus (HC). Moreover AngII acting via type 1 receptors in a cardiovascular region of the brainparaventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) regulates arterial blood pressure and autonomic function.Thus our central hypothesis is that brain RAS-driven inflammation mediates cognitive decline andhypertension in aging in the ApoE4 genotype. A major concern has been the lack of appropriate murinemodels that recapitulate hallmarks of human AD. Hence we will study novel transgenic mice that express thehuman ApoE3 or ApoE4 knockin gene combined with three transgenes (APPSW PS1dE9 and tauP301S) thatmodel AD in the mice. We will test the novel hypotheses with state-of-the art physiological and molecularapproaches in the following two specific aims. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that brain RAS-induced inflammation drives cognitive impairment in female E4 mice. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that hypertension exacerbates cognitive decline in female E4 mice with age.These studies will define underlying central mechanism(s) of cognitive decline in aging and identify noveltherapeutic target(s) that will enable discoveries from basic science to be translated into clinical practice forAlzheimers disease and related dementias.","5 year old;Affect;Age;Age-associated memory impairment;Aging;Alleles;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Alzheimers disease biomarker;American;Amyloid beta-Protein;Angiotensin II;Antihypertensive Agents;Apolipoprotein E;Backcrossings;Basic Science;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Pressure;Brain;Brain region;Cardiovascular system;Cell Nucleus;Censuses;Cholesterol;Cognition;Cognitive;Data;Dementia;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Progression;Elderly;Family;Female;Functional disorder;Gender;General Population;Genes;Genotype;Gliosis;Goals;Growth;Hand;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Hyperlipidemia;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;Impaired cognition;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Intervention;Knock-in;Learning;Life Expectancy;Link;Lipoprotein (a);Measures;Mediating;Memory;Molecular;Mouse Strains;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Peptide Receptor;Peptides;Physiological;Population;Predisposition;Preventive measure;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Quality of life;Reactive Oxygen Species;Receptor Signaling;Receptor Angiotensin Type 1;Recording of previous events;Renin-Angiotensin System;Research;Rest;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Testing;Transgenes;Transgenic Mice;Translating;United States;Woman;age related;aging hippocampus;apolipoprotein E-4;behavior test;blood damage;clinical practice;comorbidity;dementia risk;genetic risk factor;genetic variant;genome wide association study;global health;human old age (65+);improved;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;lipid metabolism;male;middle age;modifiable risk;mouse model;neuroinflammation;neuron loss;neurotoxicity;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;paraventricular nucleus;prevent;receptor;receptor expression;sex;tau Proteins;tau mutation","RAS-Driven Central Inflammation and Cognitive Decline with Aging.","PROJECT NARRATIVEAlzheimers disease (AD) and related dementias is a major debilitating disorder that affects the elderly and iscurrently without a cure.

Untreated hearing loss is associatedwith an increased risk of depression anxiety social isolation dementia and all-cause mortality. Despite thisonly 14% of people who would benefit from hearing aids use them. The most common reason adults give fornot using hearing aids is that hearing aids do not help them in the very situations they struggle to hear in themostcomplex listening environments (CLEs). CLEs are places with many different sound sources likerestaurants. Indeed restaurants are the most difficult listening environments for the majority of adults withhearing loss. Hearing aid technologies that are designed to improve speech perception in noise such as noisereduction and directional microphones show some modest benefits when tested in a laboratory environment.In the real world however these technologies show no benefits. Hearing aids can therefore demonstrateefficacy (how well they can work in the best possible scenario i.e. in a laboratory test) but fail to be effective(how well they work in the real world). We propose that listening environment complexity differences between thelab and the real world drives the hearing aid efficacy-effectiveness gap. We further propose that the effect ofenvironment complexity on listening performance is moderated by cognitive ability and the benefit of hearing aidfeatures on listening performance is moderated by environment complexity. Our aims are designed to test thesehypotheses in the laboratory using controlled experimental paradigms as well as in the real world using fieldexperiments. The proposed study is informed by information theory which defines complexity as the amount ofinformation in a communication system. Under this theory complexity can be measured using entropy to quantifyhow much information is in the system. Our team will apply this framework to understanding communication in realworld CLEs. In Aim 1 we characterize the relationship between complexity cognitive ability and hearing aid featureefficacy in the lab using a controlled experimental paradigm. In Aim 2 we characterize the relationship betweencomplexity cognitive ability and hearing aid feature effectiveness in the real world using smartphones to record realworld environments and deliver surveys to participants as well as experimental hearing aids that record howfeatures process signals in real-time. The findings from this study will: enhance our understanding of how hearingaid users perceive real world CLEs extend information theory to quantify the complexity of real world CLEs and itseffect on listening performance provide important insight into the factors that underlie the hearing aid efficacy-effectiveness gap and provide groundwork that may help guide developments to close the efficacy-effectivenessgap through clinical and engineering approaches.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Coronaviruses; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Vaccine Related","AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in global health and economic crises. To develop effective vaccinesand antivirals to prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 or other coronavirus infections it is critical tounderstand the regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 genome replication in host cells. In thisR21 project we will use novel epitranscriptomic technologies to investigate SARS-CoV-2replication in human lung epithelial cells. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications of manyviruses play a major role in epitranscriptomic regulation of viral replication gene expression andimmune evasion. However it is unclear whether and how m6A modifications of the SARS-CoV-2genome and cellular genes affect viral replication and pathogenicity.Our preliminary studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung epithelial cellsupregulated m6A levels in cellular RNA. Our bioinformatic analysis of 13699 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences predicts multiple m6A modification sites that are highly conservedamong SARS-CoV-2 isolates worldwide. Thus we hypothesize that m6A modifications of theSARS-CoV-2 genome and cellular genes enhance viral replication in cells throughepitranscriptomic regulation. We propose two specific aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1.

"Autoimmune Disease; Immunotherapy","PROJECT SUMMARY Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease in which the hair follicle is the target of attackand results clinically in hair loss. Despite the associated high lifetime risk of approximately 2% and its substantivepsychosocial impact no FDA approved treatments exist for AA. The lack of effective options for the populationthat suffers from this disfiguring disease with significant psychosocial ramifications represents a significant unmetmedical need. The absence of approved treatments is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the unbalancedequilibrium between pathogenic immune responses and immunoregulatory mechanisms that preventautoimmunity in AA. Although many cytokines pathways and cell types have been hypothesized to preventimmune attack of the hair follicle it is unknown what factors participate in regulating autoimmune responses invivo. Identifying these critical immunoregulatory participants may not only deepen our understanding of AApathogenesis but may reveal anti-inflammatory pathways that may be exploited to develop novel approaches totreatment. IL-27 is a cytokine with immunoregulatory properties that has been studied in various autoimmuneinfectious and tumor models. The receptor for IL-27 is expressed by a wide array of immune cell types as wellas epithelial and endothelial cells supporting its potential to modulate the immune system and critical celltypes that interact with the immune system. In particular IL-27 has been shown to dampen conventional T cellresponses increase the number of regulatory T cells and induce nave and previously activated CD4 and CD8T cells to produce IL-10 a well-known cytokine with anti-inflammatory effects in most contexts. Ourpreliminary data indicate that overexpression of IL-27 can substantially prevent the development of murine AAand further analysis revealed regulatory T cells and IL-10 as potential downstream candidates participating indisease suppression. We propose to study the mechanisms of AA suppression of exogenous IL-27 and its downstreameffects on regulating immune responses to the hair follicle and preventing the development of AA. We haveadopted and further developed a spontaneous AA mouse model to robustly develop disease in an induciblecontrolled and well-characterized manner by adoptive transfer of activated pathogenic T cells. Combining ourAA model with newly developed genetic tools will allow us to dissect the mechanisms by which IL-27 may beused to ablate AA pathogenesis and has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic strategies.","20 year old;Address;Adopted;Adoptive Transfer;Affect;Alopecia Areata;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antiinflammatory Effect;Autoimmune;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmune Responses;Autoimmunity;Automobile Driving;Blocking Antibodies;Bone Marrow;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Cellular biology;Clinical;Data;Dependovirus;Development;Disease;Endothelial Cells;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Equilibrium;FDA approved;Familiarity;Foundations;Gene Expression;Genetic;Goals;Hair;Hair follicle structure;Immune;Immune Targeting;Immune response;Immune system;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Interleukin-10;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Ligation;MHC Class I Genes;MHC Class II Genes;Maintenance;Mediating;Medical;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Organ;Outcome;Participant;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Population;Production;Property;Quality of life;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Skin;T cell differentiation;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic Agents;Therapeutic Uses;Tissues;United States;Up-Regulation;Work;autoimmune pathogenesis;autoreactive T cell;base;cell type;cytokine;draining lymph node;effector T cell;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;interleukin-10 receptor;lifetime risk;mortality;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;preservation;prevent;psychosocial;receptor;self esteem;side effect;tool;transcriptomics;tumor","IL-27 and downstream mechanisms in Alopecia Areata","PROJECT NARRATIVEAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease with no FDA-approved treatments that carries a lifetime risk ofapproximately 2%.

"Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Health Disparities; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Minority Health","Project Summary/AbstractCaries is a multifactorial disease that results from an imbalance between the microbiome and the host leadingto demineralization of the dental hard tissues. After a lesion initiates in enamel further tissue demineralizationwill lead to cavitation and involvement of the dentin. The etiology of caries attributes lesion progression to diet-and pH-dependent processes. However enamel and dentin differ in terms of mineral content structure andcomposition and the degradation of the organic matrix of dentin seems to be a more complex mechanism thancurrently accepted. In vitro studies from the candidates research group and from others have shown in-creased presence and activity of endogenous proteases such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in cariesdentin. Novel and important preliminary data suggest that while some MMPs may contribute for tissue degra-dation specific MMPs might be important to favor reparative processes in dentin even though tissue repairdoes not overcome degradation in advanced caries lesions. Fundamental questions remain concerning theregulatory mechanisms that drive MMPs expression and activation and how these mechanisms respond tobacterial infiltration as caries lesion advances. This proposal will address these issues by: (a) filling the gap inknowledge regarding the breadth of the contribution of specific MMPs to caries lesion progression; (b) definingthe role of odontoblast-produced and dentin-released MMPs in caries; and (c) determining how the shift in theoral microbiome can modulate MMPs expression and/or activation as the lesion progresses. These studies willprovide essential baseline information to facilitate the candidates long-term research goal which is the devel-opment of new dental therapies based on modulation of MMPs activity in caries. The candidate aims to be-come an independent researcher to pursue the creation of novel therapeutic targets based on selective inhibi-tion of damaging endogenous mechanisms and promotion of repair mechanisms that would fundamentallychange the way in which we manage and surgically treat dentin caries.

"Assistive Technology; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Hearing Loss; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention","Many children who are hard of hearing (CHH) are identified and receive early intervention during infancy. Even with this early intervention however CHH are at risk for delays in language acquisition due to reduced auditory access. These challenges may have cascading effects on reading development because language plays a foundational role in reading. Much of the research on reading comprehension in children with hearing loss (HL) has focused on elementary-age children who are deaf or combined groups of CHH with children who are deaf. Because CHH have access to a qualitatively different auditory signal than children who are deaf it is unclear if the significant delays we see with word reading and reading comprehension in children who are deaf apply to CHH in secondary grades. This lack of evidence hinders our understanding of the underlying processes that drive reading achievement in CHH which in turn limits the ability to develop scientifically based interventions and instruction. The current proposal is guided by the Simple View of Reading which proposes that reading comprehension is the product of word reading and language comprehension. This proposal is also based on the Cumulative Auditory Experience model which predicts that inconsistent auditory access in early childhood leads to reduced opportunities for language learning. Specifically this proposal tests the hypothesis that auditory access (quantified by aided audibility and amount of hearing aid use) predicts reading comprehension growth rates in CHH and this relationship is mediated by oral language. The current proposal will rectify some of the limitations of past research by leveraging our access to a large well-characterized cohort of adolescents who are hard of hearing (AHH) and age-matched adolescents with normal hearing (ANH) who have been followed from preschool to 4th grade. We propose to prospectively test this cohort out to 12th grade. Our access to this cohort will allow us to conduct a rigorous longitudinal investigation of developmental trajectories in word-level decoding and text-level reading comprehension as well as the underlying processes that drive these trajectories. We will also examine heterogeneity in sources of reading difficulty for AHH. Two aims are proposed: Aim 1. To establish developmental trajectories of reading in CHH and characterize the component reading skill profiles of AHH. We will evaluate these trajectories and profiles through a combination of retrospective (K-4th grade) and prospective (7th-12th grade) data. Aim 2. To specify the underlying processes that influence reading comprehension trajectories and outcomes in AHH and ANH. The data from this proposal will inform theoretical models of reading for children with HL using robust and modern statistical approaches to examine reading comprehension. The proposed study will provide empirical evidence for the identification of unique component skills that support reading comprehension for young children and adolescents who are hard of hearing. This evidence will guide the development of differentiated instructional approaches and future intervention research  designed to validate these scientifically based instructional approaches.","Address;Adolescent;Age;Auditory;Bilateral;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Cognitive;Data;Development;Early Intervention;Evidence based intervention;Foundations;Future;Goals;Growth;Health;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Heterogeneity;Individual Differences;Instruction;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Investigation;Knowledge;Language;Language Delays;Language Development;Lead;Learning;Linguistics;Longitudinal Studies;Mediating;Mediation;Mission;Modeling;Modernization;Morphology;Motivation;Nursery Schools;Oral;Outcome;Play;Poverty;Process;Psychosocial Factor;Public Health;Reader;Reading;Recommendation;Research;Research Design;Residual state;Risk;Role;Route;Secondary Schools;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Source;Speech;Testing;Text;Theoretical model;Time;To specify;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Vocabulary;Work;base;cohort;comprehension skill;deaf;early childhood;elementary school;experience;fourth grade;hard of hearing;hearing impairment;high school;improved;infancy;junior high school;kindergarten;language comprehension;language outcome;listening comprehension;longitudinal design;meetings;normal hearing;permanent hearing loss;programs;prospective;prospective test;psychosocial;reading ability;reading comprehension;reading difficulties;service delivery;skills;twelfth grade","Factors associated with reading comprehension in adolescents who are hard of hearing","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe research program is relevant to public health because its overarching aim is to determine the developmentalimpact of mild to severe hearing loss on reading comprehension.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryClostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infections of the colon strike close to 500000 people a year in the UnitedStates leading to nearly 30000 deaths. The CDC has declared this organism an urgent threat to public healththe highest threat category. C. difficile infections are difficult to treat in large part because the organism formsdormant spores that survive antibiotic therapy and seed recolonization of the gut when antibiotics are withdrawn.This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the antibiotics used against C. difficile also kill many of the healthygut bacteria clearing the way for C. difficile to recolonize when spores germinate. Thus there is a tremendousneed for new drugs that target C. difficile without disrupting the healthy microbiota. The premise of this proposalis that a deeper understanding of cell envelope biogenesis can pave the way towards developing better ways totreat C. difficile infections. The cell envelope is a well-validated target for antibiotics and in C. difficile theenvelope has some unusual features that suggest its assembly requires novel proteins that could be exploitedas targets of C. difficile-selective antibiotics. In Aim 1 we will use genetics biochemistry and microscopy tounderstand the roles and regulation of enzymes that crosslink the peptidoglycan cell wall. These enzymescaptured our attention because in C. difficile the cell wall contains an unusually high percentage of 3-3crosslinks as compared to the 4-3 crosslinks that predominate in most bacteria. Our experiments will addressthe following questions: Which enzymes are responsible for 3-3 and 4-3 crosslink formation and do they operateduring division elongation or both? How is the ratio of 3-3 to 4-3 crosslinking regulated? How does C. difficilebenefit from using primarily 3-3 crosslinks? In Aim 2 we will leverage a powerful new gene-silencing tool calledCRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to assign a set of ~50 putatively essential envelope biogenesis genes to morespecific functional pathways. These genes are intrinsically interesting and constitute potential new antibiotictargets. We will also undertake a detailed analysis of a novel transcriptional regulatory system uncovered in apilot version of our proposed screen. Collectively the lines of investigation to be pursued here will greatlyadvance our understanding of C. difficile biology by identifying new proteins involved in assembly of the cellenvelope and revealing how their activities are coordinated to accomplish the complex processes of growth anddivision.

Approaches to increasing bicycling safety among youthinclude bicycle safety education programs and parents also play a vital role as influencers of their child'sbicycle handling and traffic safety skills perceptions and self-efficacy. Bicycle safety education programs areabundant but little is known about their effectiveness in terms of behavior change. This cluster randomizedcontrolled trial will evaluate a community-based bicycle safety education program with and without an in-person parent training component. We will recruit 180 early adolescent bicyclists (ages 9 to 12) and aparent/guardian from local neighborhood centers after school and summer programs where we haveconducted preliminary studies. Randomization into the three study groups will occur at the site-level.Adolescent bicycles in all study group sites will be equipped with Pedal Portal an innovative bicycle-mountedGPS/video system developed by our research team to objectively observe bicycling risk exposure andbehaviors while bicycling. System data will be coded to measure bicycling exposure (hours miles traveledroutes) and the types and rates of safety-relevant events (near crashes crashes) and safety-relevantbehaviors (e.g. following traffic rules scanning for traffic at intersections). This will be the first randomized trialto use GPS and video technology to evaluate the effectiveness of a youth bicycle safety intervention inchanging behavior. The control group will not receive any bicycle safety education programming. Participantsin the first intervention group (Bike Club) will receive a 12-hour bicycle safety education program.

Our main hypotheses are that adolescents who receive the bicycle safety interventionwill have increased safety behaviors (e.g. helmet use hazard recognition) reduced errors (e.g. riding againsttraffic swerving/wobbling) and increased knowledge perceptions and self-efficacy compared to the controlgroup; and adolescents whose parent receives the parent training will have even greater improvements instudy outcomes than those whose parents do not receive the training.

"Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition","PROJECT SUMMARYThe motivation to consume sodium often referred to as ""sodium (or salt) appetite"" is a hard-wired neuralresponse to sodium deficiency regulated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Impairedfunction of this system results in inappropriate sodium ingestion that can have deleterious effects oncardiovascular health. The studies and career development activities in this K99/R00 proposal are designed toprovide the candidate Dr. Jon Resch with the training necessary to become an independent investigator witha research program examining the neural control of sodium appetite. Recently two RAAS-sensitive neuronalpopulations have been shown to regulate sodium appetite: aldosterone-sensing neurons in the nucleus of thesolitary tract (NTSHsd11b2 neurons) and a subpopulation of angiotensin II (AngII)-sensing neurons in thesubfornical organ (SFO). Importantly both NTSHsd11b2 neurons and AngII-sensing SFO neurons are necessaryfor deficiency-induced sodium appetite and NTSHsd11b2 neurons require concurrent AngII signaling to driverapid and robust sodium consumption. Furthermore both RAAS-sensitive populations promote sodiumingestion via projections to the ventral lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vlBNST). This stronglysuggests that the vlBNST is the critical site where neural processing occurs to coordinate sodium appetite.However the functional complexity and neurochemical heterogeneity of the vlBNST poses a significantchallenge to finding and investigating the neurons within it that regulate sodium appetite. In order to elucidatethe neural circuits that control sodium appetite the proposed research will (1) confirm the site of AngIIsignaling that enables NTSHsd11b2 neurons to drive sodium appetite (2) decipher the wiring diagram of RAAS-sensitive inputs to the vlBNST (3) use high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics to generate a ""molecularcensus"" of vlBNST neurons and (4) identify the molecular signature of vlBNST ""sodium appetite"" neurons.The results of these experiments will form the foundation for many future studies regarding sodium appetitecontrol by the BNST and the downstream circuits through which these neurons produce the motivation toconsume sodium. The proposed research and training will be conducted within the Endocrine Division of theDepartment of Medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and will ensure the Dr. Resch's successfultransition to scientific independence.

"Cancer; Hematology; Immunotherapy; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYNew immunotherapies targeting lymphomas delivered promising results during recent clinical trials. Howeverthese therapies were only effective in a small subset of patients with short periods of remission. The results fromthese studies suggested the existence of immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed thelymphoma microenvironment is a very dynamic network between lymphoma cells and non-malignantcomponents that may promote tumor growth and consequently drug resistance. Progress in T cell metabolismhas demonstrated that T cells experience a metabolic disadvantage in the tumor microenvironment which oftenmanifests in T cell exhaustion that jeopardizes their potential to destroy cancer cells. This reveals a critical needto explore new (metabolic) approaches to improve T cell performance. Our research team proposes to target themetabolism of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) as a novel metabolic checkpoint of T cell activation inthe lymphoma microenvironment. Our rationale stems from the findings that the BCAA leucine is indispensablefor T cells activation while BCAA metabolism initiated by the cytosolic (BCATc) and mitochondrial (BCATm)branched-chain aminotransferases is a means to direct leucine toward degradation. The objective in thisapplication is to determine whether a loss of expression of BCATc and BCATm is beneficial for the durability andfunctional integrity of T cells during lymphoma eradication in unique pre-clinical mouse models created in ourlaboratory. The long-term goal of this application is to provide new means to improve the T cell-mediated immuneresponse and to address the challenges with T cell-driven anti-lymphoma immunotherapy. The centralhypothesis is that BCATc supported by BCATm serves to provide checkpoint control on T cell function by beinga part of a negative feedback loop regulation of T cell activation. Deletion of the BCAT genes from T cellsindividually or in combination may provide a metabolic advantage of T cells allowing them to remain activatedand to successfully combat lymphoma growth. To test the central hypothesis we identified three specific aims:(1) Investigate how the expression of BCATc and BCATm changes upon T cell subset differentiation and whetherthe BCAT proteins are essential for T cell lineage commitment and function (2) Determine whether a blockagein the transamination of BCAAs enhances the T cell response to lymphoma tumors and (3) Investigate whethera loss of expression of BCATc in mouse T cells can overcome the lymphoma resistance to anti-CTLA4 therapy.Completion of this project will not only provide the opportunity to improve the current treatment options forlymphoma patients but will also engage students in pre-clinical cancer studies. The students will highly benefitfrom acquiring hands-on research experience in cancer which can be translated into enhanced research skillsscientific reasoning and better understanding of treatment approaches.","Address;Amino Acids;Binding;Blood;Branched-Chain Amino Acids;Cancer Patient;Cell Lineage;Cell Survival;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Clinical Trials;Clonal Expansion;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes;Data;Development;Disadvantaged;Disease;Disease remission;Drug resistance;Enzymes;FOXP3 gene;Feedback;Foundations;Future;Generations;Genes;Goals;Growth;Health Benefit;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;Individual;Intervention;Journals;Knock-out;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Leucine;Link;Lymphocyte;Lymphoma;Lymphoma cell;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Medical Students;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Mus;Non-Malignant;Nutrient;Outcome Study;Patients;Peer Review;Performance;Personal Satisfaction;Promoter Regions;Proteins;Publishing;Regimen;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Resistance;Role;Students;T cell differentiation;T cell regulation;T cell response;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Lymphoma;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;Testing;Translating;Tumor Escape;amino acid metabolism;anti-CTLA-4 therapy;branched-chain-amino-acid transaminase;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapeutics;cancer immunotherapy;cancer type;cell mediated immune response;collaborative environment;combat;exhaustion;experience;graduate student;hands on research;improved;mouse model;novel;patient subsets;pre-clinical;prevent;response;side effect;skills;stem;symposium;therapeutic target;transamination;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor-immune system interactions;undergraduate student;uptake","Elucidating the role of the Branched Chain Aminotransferases (BCATc and BCATm) as novel metabolic checkpoints of anti-lymphoma T cell immunity","PROJECT NARRATIVESubstantial drug resistance of lymphoma patients to current immunotherapeutic regimens is linked to theimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that depletes the white blood lymphocytes (T cells) of essentialnutrients and causes their exhaustion during the T cell-mediated anti-lymphoma immune response.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Genetics; Lung; Lung Cancer; Women's Health","Project Summary / AbstractNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common causes of cancer death in the USA and despiterecent advances the overall 5-year survival rate remains low (~20%). There is an urgent need to develop novelnon-toxic approaches to improve survival and preserve quality of life. The current research team has recentlymade the exciting and unexpected discovery that unique non-ionizing orthogonal electromagnetic fields (EMFs)significantly reduced clonogenic survival in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore in the A549xenograft model EMF treatment significantly slowed tumor growth and improved overall survival when combinedwith conventional radio-chemo-therapies as well as being well-tolerated with no apparent adverse effects.Interestingly phosphorylated H2AX a marker of DNA damage was also significantly elevated in EMF treatedtumors suggesting an increase in oxidative DNA damage. These preliminary findings suggest that EMFs mayserve as an effective adjuvant to combined modality cancer therapies. There is a now critical need to determinethe feasibility and specific mechanisms associated with this novel approach. The overall objective of the currentproposal is to determine specific mechanisms whereby orthogonally applied EMFs can provide a safe andeffective adjuvant to radio-chemo-therapy in preclinical mouse models. Based on preliminary data wehypothesize that orthogonally oriented EMFs selectively enhance steady-state levels of O2- and H2O2 incancer cells leading to metabolic oxidative stress DNA damage and radio-chemo-sensitization. TwoSpecific Aims will address the hypothesis including: Aim 1. Determine the extent to which EMF-therapy resultsin O2- and H2O2 driven cancer cell specific oxidative stress leading to enhanced DNA damage and responsesto radio-chemo-therapy in vitro; and Aim 2. Determine the safety and efficacy as well as the involvement of O2-and H2O2 in mechanisms responsible for EMF enhancement of cancer therapy responses in vivo using xenograftand orthotopic mouse models of NSCLC. Sophisticated genetic approaches using doxycycline inducibleantioxidant enzymes and measurements of biochemical parameters indicative of oxidative stress will be utilizedto test the hypothesis. If successful the proposal directly addresses the R21 program announcement (PAR-20-292) by providing novel exploratory research relevant to cancer treatment and innovative preclinical studiesdeveloping novel EMF-based cancer therapeutics which could lead to first-in-human clinical trials. Successfulcompletion of this work will also rigorously define mechanisms of action for cancer cell specific EMF effectsinvolving metabolic oxidative stress mediated by O2- and H2O2. These data can be used to support the clinicaldevelopment of a non-invasive non-toxic EMF-based combined modality approaches amenable to early phaseclinical trials in human subjects with NSCLC.","A549;Address;Adjuvant;Adverse effects;Animals;Biochemical;Biological;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Death;Cellular Metabolic Process;Cessation of life;Chemosensitization;Chronic;Clinical Trials;Coupled;DNA Damage;DNA Markers;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Detection;Development;Dose;Doxycycline;Electromagnetic Fields;Electrons;Epithelial Cells;Evaluation;Exploratory/Developmental Grant;Frequencies;Gamma-H2AX;Goals;H1299;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;In Vitro;Lead;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Modality;NIH Program Announcements;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Publications;Quality of life;Radio;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research;Role;Safety;Superoxide Dismutase;Superoxides;Survival Rate;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Treatment outcome;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;anticancer activity;antioxidant enzyme;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;catalase;cell killing;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;clinical application;clinical development;combined cancer modality therapy;cytotoxic;early phase clinical trial;electric field;experimental study;first-in-human;follow-up;genetic approach;genetic immunotherapy;glutathione peroxidase;human subject;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;innovation;insight;lung cancer cell;magnetic field;metabolic abnormality assessment;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;oxidative DNA damage;personalized approach;pre-clinical;preclinical study;preservation;response;tumor;tumor growth","Evaluation of Orthogonally Oriented Electromagnetic Fields to Stabilize ROS Induce DNA damage and Improve Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer","Project NarrativeThe successful completion of this project will lead to insights into novel cancer treatment modalities using novelorthogonal electromagnetic fields (EMFs) applicable to non-small cell lung cancers.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia and an estimated 5.8 million people in theUnited States age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2020 (alz.org). Accumulation of amyloidbeta (A) a misfolded protein is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease but drug candidatestargeting A pathways have yielded little success [1]. More recently changes in metabolism particularly glucosemetabolism have been identified as a common feature observed in Alzheimer's disease [2 3]. Notablyapproximately 80% of patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit impairments in glucose tolerance [4]. Theseobservations along with other epidemiological data have led to the postulation that Alzheimer's disease may inpart be a metabolic disorder [3 5]. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone that correctsmetabolic dysfunction and reverses diabetes and obesity in animal models [6]. FGF21 is an important regulatorof glucose homeostasis and is a potent insulin sensitizer. Clinical trials with FGF21 mimetics have alsodemonstrated the efficacy of targeting this pathway to improve metabolic profiles in humans [7]. Interestinglyrecent data suggests that FGF21 administration may also prevent neurodegeneration [8-10] and pathologicaldeficits in animal models of Alzheimer's disease [11-13]. While circulating FGF21 levels are derived primarily bythe liver [14] our preliminary data reveals the unexpected discovery that FGF21 is also expressed in a veryspecific region of the central nervous system. Specifically FGF21 is expressed in the retrosplenial cortex andcan signal to the hippocampus and can regulate learning and memory. A previous study demonstrates thatFGF21 is induced from neurons in response to mitochondrial stress [9] and we hypothesize that FGF21 inductionin this region regulates metabolic processes to prevent neurodegeneration. Several lines of evidence suggestthat during prolonged metabolic impairments endogenous signaling of FGF21 may be impaired leading to aFGF21 resistant state [15]. Importantly administration of pharmacological levels of FGF21 is sufficient toovercome this resistance and restore metabolic homeostasis [16]. In this proposal we seek to explore whetherendogenous FGF21 signaling is also impaired during Alzheimer's disease progression and whether restorationof central FGF21 signaling via pharmacological administration of FGF21 or local induction of FGF21 viasustained adeno-associated viral delivery is sufficient to attenuate the cognitive and pathological deficits in amouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Together these studies will provide a better understanding of this potentialtherapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's Disease and its related dementias.","Alcohol consumption;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease model;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animal Model;Attenuated;Brain;Brain Diseases;Cells;Clinical Trials;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Collaborations;Data;Defect;Dementia;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease Progression;Endocrine;Energy Metabolism;Exhibits;FGFR1 gene;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors;Hippocampus (Brain);Homeostasis;Hormones;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Impaired cognition;Impairment;In Vitro;Insulin Resistance;Learning;Link;Liver;Liver Circulation;Mediating;Memory;Memory impairment;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Nutrient;Obesity;Oxidative Stress;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Play;Process;Production;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Rodent;Role;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stress;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;United States;Viral;abeta accumulation;base;blood glucose regulation;cholinergic neuron;cognitive function;drug candidate;epidemiologic data;excitatory neuron;fibroblast growth factor 21;glucose metabolism;glucose tolerance;human old age (65+);improved;in vivo;insight;insulin sensitivity;insulin sensitizing drugs;metabolic profile;mimetics;misfolded protein;mitochondrial dysfunction;mouse model;nonhuman primate;novel therapeutic intervention;prevent;receptor;response;restoration;success;tau Proteins","Endocrine Regulation of Alcohol Intake","PROJECT NARRATIVEAlzheimer's disease is a degenerative brain disorder characterized by defects in memory but is also associatedwith metabolic dysfunction leading some to suggest that Alzheimer's disease may also be a metabolic disorder.Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine factor that signals to the brain to maintain metabolichomeostasis and pharmacological administration of FGF21 improves metabolic profiles in both rodents andhumans with metabolic dysfunction.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Endocrine Disruptors; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY. Exposure to the organochlorine dieldrin predisposes individuals to Parkinson'sDisease (PD); however the mechanisms linking exposure to disease unknown. Dieldrin can disrupt DAhomeostasis but alone may be insufficient for loss of dopamine (DA) neurons and neurodegeneration mayrequire an additional hit. Several animal models have demonstrated that altering DA homeostasismetabolism and/or trafficking yields progressive loss of DA neurons; therefore a genetic variation modifyingDA metabolism may be an additional hit that has toxic synergy with pesticide exposure. Disruption of DAhomeostasis generates toxic intermediates such as ROS and aldehydes (34-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehydeDOPAL) via monoamine oxidase. Similar to PD there is evidence that dieldrin is a risk factor for Alzheimer'sDisease (AD). It has been proposed that altered NE homeostasis is linked to the production of toxic speciesand cell injury relevant to AD. As with DA NE is biotransformed via monoamine oxidase to an aldehyde (34-dihydroxyphenylglycolaldehyde DOPEGAL) which is highly protein reactive and toxic. Early ADneuropathology occurs in the locus coeruleus (LC) a major site of NE innervation in the brain and involvesneurofibrillary tangles of the protein Tau following its cleavage by an asparagine proteinase (AEP). Recentreports demonstrated that the NE metabolite DOPEGAL activates AEP to cleave Tau and induce Tauaggregation. Modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is thought to be important for AD pathology and mayinfluence LC dynamics and NE metabolism. We hypothesize NE metabolism/trafficking as a target for dieldrinproducing elevated levels of DOPEGAL which affects Tau processing and yields Tau aggregation. In additionwe posit that modulation of ECM as the second hit that influences cellular responses to dieldrin. Theproposed work is highly relevant to AD neuropathogenesis and builds upon the previously funded application.The goal of this supplement is to elucidate mechanisms underlying environmental risk factors for ADspecifically focusing on the interaction of the pesticide dieldrin with NE metabolism in neurons and the role ofthe ECM. The central hypothesis is that dieldrin targets NE metabolism and/or trafficking in neurons yieldingbuild-up of reactive metabolites that initiate toxic pathways such as tau fibrillization injuring neurons in anECM-dependent manner. Two specific aims will be completed: 1) Elucidate the outcomes of pesticide/dieldrinexposure on noradrenergic cells for production of the toxic species DOPEGAL. 2) Determine the contribution ofthe ECM to pesticide- and DOPEGAL-mediated cellular injury. These Specific Aims will build upon previouswork to address key mechanistic questions for AD regarding critical cellular interactions yielding vulnerability ofneurons to pesticides. These innovative studies are significant to identifying key mechanistic targets ofneurotoxic pesticides and to identifying potential biomarkers for individuals at risk for developing AD.","Actins;Address;Adhesions;Affect;Age;Agriculture;Aldehydes;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathology;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Alzheimer&apos;s neuropathogenesis;Animal Model;Antioxidants;Area;Asparagine;Brain;Brain region;Cadherins;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chemicals;Chlorinated Hydrocarbons;Cleaved cell;Complex;Development;Dieldrin;Disease;Disease Progression;Dopamine;Dose;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemiology;Etiology;Exposure to;Extracellular Matrix;Funding;Generations;Genetic Variation;Goals;Homeostasis;Impairment;Individual;Injury;Integrins;Link;Measurement;Mechanoreceptors;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Biotransformation;Metabolism;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Monoamine Oxidase;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Norepinephrine;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;Pesticides;Process;Production;Proteins;Reaction;Reporting;Research;Risk;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;System;Testing;Tissues;Translating;Work;cell injury;detoxication;disease diagnosis;dopaminergic neuron;early detection biomarkers;elastography;environmental agent;exposed human population;fluid flow;gene environment interaction;improved;innovation;locus ceruleus structure;mechanical properties;nerve supply;nervous system disorder;neuropathology;neurotoxic;neurotransmitter metabolism;neurotransmitter release;new therapeutic target;noradrenergic;novel;pesticide exposure;pesticide interaction;phenylacetaldehyde;polymerization;potential biomarker;response;stem;synergism;tau Proteins;tau aggregation;toxicant;trafficking;viscoelasticity","Pesticide-Mediated Generation of a Toxic Neurotransmitter Metabolite","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe goal of this research supplement is to identify molecular mechanisms by which pesticide exposurepredisposes individuals to neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Diseaseconsidering a multi-hit model.

Withadvances in medical science and technology substantially extending human lifespan the numbers ofindividuals living longer and affected by Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is expected to increasesignificantly. While sleep disturbances have long been viewed as symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and otherneurodegenerative diseases recent research has suggested that chronic sleep disruption may be a significantrisk factor for Alzheimer's disease decades later. Poor sleep patterns and chronic sleep loss also appear toaccelerate the rate of disease progression and pathogenesis. Acute and chronic sleep deprivation have alsobeen shown to increase tau pathologies and amyloid beta peptides pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer'sdisease. Recent estimates suggest that over 35% of adults suffer from chronic sleep deprivation making itimperative that we identify the mechanisms through which chronic sleep deprivation affects Alzheimer'spathogenesis. The hippocampus a critical brain region for memory is particularly susceptible to the effects ofsleep deprivation and is one of the first regions to exhibit phenotypic pathologies in Alzheimer's disease.

"No NIH Category available","SummaryThere is an unmet need for an experimental approach to screen small molecules as potential allostericinhibitors to support drug discovery. Allostery involves binding an effector at a remote site on an enzymethat causes changes in the properties of the active site. Discovering drug candidate molecules that actallosterically is difficult however because the screen should identify molecules that bind to the enzymebut only those that do so specifically at sites other than the active site and result in a change in thecatalytic properties. Although screening methods can readily identify binding events determining themode of binding or the effect on activity requires additional assessment. The central objective of thisproposal is to evaluate the appropriateness and performance of two-dimensional infrared (2D IR)spectroscopy as a tool for screening for allosteric effectors of enzymes. 2D IR measures theconformational dynamics and heterogeneity of the environment around a vibrational chromophore withfemtosecond time resolution and previous applications to proteins show that it is sensitive to subtlechanges. The following two aims will achieve the goals of this project: Aim 1. Accelerate and automate2D IR data collection for rapid screening; and Aim 2. Assess the sensitivity and specificity of 2D IR as aprobe of allosteric binding. The first aim will be accomplished by implementing a dual-beam approach foractive background subtraction in 2D IR introducing fitting methods to to extract the dynamic observablesfrom a small number of measurements and developing a multi-well sample holder and automating theprocess of serially measuring the 2D IR data for a large set of samples in a rapid screen. In the secondaim which is entirely independent of the first three model systems with known allosteric inhibitors willbe studied to determine the effects of the binding of the allosteric effector on the dynamics measured atthe active site by 2D IR. These models are a diverse group of well-studied enzymes HIV-1 reversetranscriptase b-lactamase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The probe a cyanophenylalaninewill be mutated into each in place of an existing active-site phenylalanine residue for the 2D IRexperiments. The approach is innovative because it develops a new and substantively different way ofdiscovering allosteric effectors of enzymes. If successful 2D IR would be a new and enabling technologyfor drug discovery. The proposed studies are significant because they will provide the critical proof-of-concept for the idea and advance the technical approach to 2D IR to make it suitable for rapid screening.Ultimately 2D IR has the potential to be a powerful tool for drug discovery.","Active Sites;Allosteric Regulation;Amyloid Fibrils;Area;Binding;Binding Sites;Biological;Biological Models;Communication;Data;Data Collection;Development;Distal;Drug Interactions;Eligibility Determination;Environment;Enzymes;Event;Funding Mechanisms;Goals;HIV-1;Heterogeneity;Measurement;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Molecular Conformation;Mutate;Noise;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenylalanine;Process;Property;Proteins;Public Health;RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;Rapid screening;Research;Research Project Grants;Resolution;Sampling;Screening procedure;Sensitivity and Specificity;Series;Signal Transduction;Site;Spectrum Analysis;Structure;System;Technology;Technology Development Study;Time;Work;amyloid formation;beta-Lactamase;chromophore;data acquisition;drug candidate;drug discovery;experimental study;high risk;human disease;improved;infrared spectroscopy;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;molecular recognition;novel therapeutics;p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase;protein structure;screening;small molecule;tool;two-dimensional;vibration","Rapid Screening of Allosteric Effectors Using Two-Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy","Project NarrativeThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop new tools for drug discoverythat can be used to identify new drug candidates for a wide range of human diseases.

"Autoimmune Disease; Immunization; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Wound Healing and Care","PROJECT SUMMARYThere is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of Bullous pemphigoid (BP) anautoimmune blistering disease. Thus standard treatment consists of high dose immunosuppression which isassociated with significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly population typically affected by BP. Our long-term goal is to identify the cellular and molecular events that lead to the development and propagation ofcutaneous autoimmunity so that better therapies can be developed. The objective of this proposal is to developan active mouse model of BP that recapitulates human disease by eliciting both IgE and IgG autoantibodies BP.Although BP is one of a growing number of autoimmune diseases characterized by pathogenic IgEautoantibodies and these IgE antibodies are critical for recapitulation of human disease in passive transfermodels of disease there is no active disease model that includes both an IgG and an IgE response to the BPautoantigen. Our hypothesis that the route of antigen exposure is critical for the development of an IgEautoantibody response. The rationale for the proposed research is generation of a robust active model of BP willaddress the shortcomings of current passive models and will facilitate studies of the basic mechanisms of BPand other instances of IgE-mediated autoimmunity. Guided by our preliminary data this hypothesis will be testedby pursuing the following specific aim: To identify the immunization regimen that generates mBP180-specific IgEand IgG and cutaneous lesions consistent with BP. Mice will be immunized with the murine homolog of the BPautoantigen to determined how the route of antigen exposure influences the form and nature of the autoantibodyresponse. At regular intervals the extent of skin disease the level of circulating antibodies and the cutaneousimmune cell populations will be assessed. These studies are relevant to the NIHs mission aimed at enhancinghealth lengthening life and reducing illness and to that of the NIAID to better understand the immunologic basisof disease including developing a greater understanding of fundamental immunologic principles underlyingdisease onset and progression and developing improved animal models of disease. This approach is innovativebecause there are currently no established mouse models of human autoimmune diseases that feature IgE. Theproposed studies are significant because they will advance and expand our understanding of the basicmechanisms of cutaneous autoimmunity and will lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at identifying thecellular and molecular mechanisms of disease that can be targeted therapeutically.","Abbreviations;Address;Adhesions;Affect;Animal Disease Models;Antibodies;Antigens;Autoantibodies;Autoantigens;Autoimmune;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;BP180 autoantigen;Basement membrane;Binding;Biopsy;Bulla;Bullous Pemphigoid;Cells;Collagen Type XVII;Cutaneous;Data;Deposition;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Dose;Elderly;Event;Formalin;Future;Generations;Goals;Health;Homologous Gene;Human;IgE;IgG autoantibodies;Immune;Immunization;Immunize;Immunoglobulin G;Immunologics;Immunosuppression;Inflammation;Injections;Intranasal Administration;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Lesion;Life;Mediating;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;Nature;Onset of illness;Paraffin Embedding;Passive Transfer of Immunity;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Patients;Play;Population;Prevention;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Recombinants;Regimen;Research;Role;Route;SJL/J Mouse;Sampling;Secondary Immunization;Skin;Study models;Testing;Tissues;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;cellular targeting;effective therapy;human disease;human model;human subject;immune activation;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;innovation;insight;mortality;mouse model;peripheral tolerance;response;skin disorder;standard care;targeted treatment;therapy outcome;tool","Generation of IgG and IgE autoantibodies in an active mouse model of Bullous pemphigoid","NARRATIVEThese studies will define the conditions necessary to establish an active mouse model of Bullous pemphigoidusing repeated immunization to generate IgG and IgE autoantibodies.

Executive dysfunction is an early hallmark of cognitive impairment inPD. Because standard treatments for motor symptoms in PD such as levodopa and high frequency deepbrain stimulation (DBS) can potentially worsen cognition and speech there is a critical need to developtreatments targeting cognitive and speech impairments in PD. Our long-term goal is to understand thephysiological basis of cognition and speech impairments in PD. Our prior work suggests that cognitiveand speech deficits in PD are associated with altered PFC 4 Hz oscillations. Despite this data thenetwork mechanisms that underlie prefrontal (PFC) 4 Hz rhythms are unknown. The overall objective ofthe proposed research is to determine the anatomical basis of PFC 4 Hz changes in PD. Our publishedwork demonstrates that PFC 4 Hz rhythms are attenuated in PD and our preliminary data indicate thatthese rhythms are specifically linked with cognitive and speech impairments. We will collect EEG andMRI data to determine key correlates of cognitive and speech symptoms. We will concentrate ondorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as key PFCregions involved in executive functions and speech generation and their subcortical connections withSTN (hyperdirect pathway) and the caudate nucleus which are critical cognitive nodes. These methodswill generate fundamental insights about how PFC 4 Hz rhythms affect cognition and speech in humanPD patients. We will test the hypothesis that PFC 4 Hz oscillations coordinate brain-wide activity duringcognitive and speech tasks.Our first aim is to determine the structural origin of the deficits in PFC 4 Hz oscillations in PD by using acombination of structural MRI to assess the cortical thickness of key PFC regions structural connectivityusing diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) tractography between key PFC regions and subcortical structures(STN and caudate) and high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) at rest and during performance ofcognitive and speech tasks in participants with PD across different levels of severity (mild moderate andadvanced). Our second aim is to determine how PFC functional network mechanisms are linked withdeficits in PFC 4 Hz oscillations by using simultaneous EEG-fMRI to examine BOLD changes duringcognitive and speech tasks used in Aim 1 and in Project 2. We will examine resting-state connectivity ofkey PFC regions and subcortical structures. As in Aim 1 we will also use a control group and work withmoderate PD participants identified from Project 2. Understanding the anatomical and functional basis of4Hz PFC rhythms might be eventually useful for neuromodulation to treat cognitive and speechimpairments in PD.","Affect;Anatomy;Anterior;Attenuated;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Brain;Characteristics;Cognition;Cognitive;Control Groups;Data;Deep Brain Stimulation;Development;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Dyskinetic syndrome;Electroencephalogram;Executive Dysfunction;Frequencies;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Future;Gene Expression;Generations;Goals;Human;Impairment;Levodopa;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Methods;Motor;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Parkinson Disease;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Physiological;Prefrontal Cortex;Publishing;Quality of life;Research;Rest;Severities;Severity of illness;Specific qualifier value;Speech;Structural defect;Structure;Symptoms;Testing;Thick;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Work;caudate nucleus;cingulate cortex;cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos;s;cognitive performance;density;executive function;experimental study;improved;insight;motor disorder;motor symptom;multimodality;neurophysiology;neuroregulation;operation;standard care;synergism;tractography","Multimodal analysis of human PFC 4 Hz rhythms in cognition and speech in PD","Per the RFA do not include narrative.","NINDS","10283245","9/17/2021","RFA-NS-21-002","1P20NS123151-01","1","P20","NS","123151","01","","","9/17/2021","6/30/2023","Special Emphasis Panel[ZNS1 SRB-H (16)]","7580","7005893","UC, ERGUN Y","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","122131"," ","79049","43082"," "," ",
"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Rehabilitation","AbstractParkinson's disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent progressive neurodegenerative disorder that inmost patients eventually leads to disabling non-motor symptoms including significant speech andcognitive dysfunction. These impairments can dramatically reduce quality of life for patients and theirfamilies. Importantly few treatments exist that can effectively treat these non-motor effects. Furthermoretreatments like dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation (DBS) that are generally effectiveat improving the motor function of people with PD are very often ineffective at improving speech andcognition. In many cases these treatments can even worsen those functions.Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be key to effective human speech and cognitive function. Howevermany questions remain about how human PFC is affected by PD and how these disease-specific effectsresult in disrupted speech and cognitive function. To address these knowledge gaps and in order tooptimize and develop better treatments for those living with PD it is necessary to better understand therole of PFC in speech and cognition. Here we study 20 PD patients who have chosen to undergobilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS implantation surgery to leverage this special opportunity todirectly record from PFC sites during speech and cognitive tasks during surgery. In addition we willsimultaneously record from STN as it is known to be connected to PFC and modulated by those brainregions. To complement the detailed anatomical and temporal resolution of direct PFC and STN brainrecordings and effective connectivity measures between these cortical and subcortical regionsparticipants will also be assessed with detailed structural functional and connectivity MRI imagingstudies. Scans will be obtained before and three months after surgery so all areas of PFC in bothcerebral hemispheres can be assessed with speech and cognitive tasks.In addition we will collect PFC tissue samples in these participants during their surgery to examine geneexpression. Gene expression profiles related to dopamine and cholinergic pathways and language willbe quantified. To our knowledge this feasibility data will be the first of its kind to evaluate participantswith PD before during and after surgery with the goals of defining the role of PFC and its interactionswith STN in speech and cognitive function. Such knowledge will provide mechanistic insights that cannotbe obtained using other techniques and will guide development of new studies and hopefully eventuallytreatments of impaired speech and cognition in PD.","Address;Affect;Anatomy;Area;Basal Ganglia;Bilateral;Bradykinesia;Brain;Brain region;Cerebral hemisphere;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Complement;DRD1 gene;Data;Deep Brain Stimulation;Development;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease;Dopamine;Electrophysiology (science);FOXP2 gene;Family;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Human;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Knowledge;Language;Limb structure;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Microelectrodes;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Motor;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Prefrontal Cortex;Production;Quality of life;Refractory;Research;Resolution;Rest Tremor;Role;Scanning;Signal Pathway;Site;Specimen;Speech;Structure;Structure of subthalamic nucleus;Study Subject;Symptoms;Synaptic plasticity;System;Techniques;Tissue Sample;Transcript;alpha synuclein;awake;base;cholinergic;cognitive function;cognitive impairment in Parkinson&apos;s;cognitive task;effective therapy;functional decline;gene therapy;imaging study;implantation;improved;insight;motor control;motor function improvement;neural model;neurophysiology;non-motor symptom;novel strategies;personalized medicine;relating to nervous system;side effect;temporal measurement;transcriptome sequencing","PFC circuits and systems in human intraoperative neurophysiology","Per the RFA do not include narrative.","NINDS","10283244","9/17/2021","RFA-NS-21-002","1P20NS123151-01","1","P20","NS","123151","01","","","9/17/2021","6/30/2023","Special Emphasis Panel[ZNS1 SRB-H (16)]","7579","9246534","GREENLEE, JEREMY ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","123178"," ","79727","43451"," "," ",
"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","AbstractParkinsons disease (PD) causes deficits not only in motor function but also in cognition and speechleading to significant loss of independence. Few interventions are available to treat these non-motorsymptoms and current therapies can worsen them. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunction inthe prefrontal cortex (PFC) is responsible for impaired cognition and speech in PD. Our work shows thatpatients with PD have impaired prefrontal 4 Hz rhythms and these abnormal oscillations in local fieldpotentials correlate with impaired cognitive and speech processes. However the pathophysiology thatleads to disruption of prefrontal rhythms in PD remains unclear.The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine how PFC cortical circuits are destabilizedby pathophysiological processes in PD using a combination of cell-type-specific tagging with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in awake behaving mice. Our hypothesis is that 4 Hz rhythms are orchestratedby layer V neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors during interval timing. Both cognitive andspeech function require temporal organization of behavior that is vital to higher-level executive functionssuch as behavioral flexibility and planning. However in patients with PD temporal organization ofbehavior is abnormal. Our team has modeled temporal deficits in PD using an elementary cognitive taskknown as interval timing during which a subject estimates a fixed interval of time. In PD patients intervaltiming is reliably disrupted. Interestingly 4 Hz rhythms are nearly identical in humans and rodents andthey are attenuated in both PD patients and rodent models of PD. The 4 Hz rhythms in the rodent medialPFC (functionally analogous to the human mediofrontal cortex) coordinate cognitive control duringinterval-timing tasks but the cellular and laminar source of these rhythms is unknown.In Aim 1 we will use in vivo 2-photon imaging in awake behaving mice to identify the cellular source ofprefrontal 4 Hz rhythms critical for interval timing tasks. In Aim 2 we will determine how PD-relevantpathophysiology including dopaminergic cholinergic and alpha-synuclein affects prefrontal networks.The expected outcomes of this research will be identifying the cells and circuits that give rise toendogenous 4 Hz rhythms and determining the effects of specific PD pathological processes. Theseinsights will lead to a novel understanding of PFC function that could be relevant for understandingcognitive and speech symptoms in human PD patients.","Acetylcholine;Affect;Attenuated;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Calcium;Cells;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;Data;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;Financial compensation;Foundations;Functional disorder;Future;Goals;Grant;Human;Image;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Intervention;Medial;Microscopy;Modeling;Motor;Mus;Neurons;Outcomes Research;Parkinson Disease;Pathologic Processes;Pathology;Patients;Performance;Phase;Population;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Research;Rodent;Rodent Model;Source;Speech;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;Training;Viral;Work;alpha synuclein;awake;cell cortex;cell type;cholinergic;clinically relevant;cognitive control;cognitive task;executive function;flexibility;in vivo;in vivo calcium imaging;insight;neuroregulation;non-motor symptom;novel;overexpression;synergism;time interval;two photon microscopy;two-photon","Cellular mechanisms in rodent prefrontal cortex","Per the RFA do not include narrative.","NINDS","10283243","9/17/2021","RFA-NS-21-002","1P20NS123151-01","1","P20","NS","123151","01","","","9/17/2021","6/30/2023","Special Emphasis Panel[ZNS1 SRB-H (16)]","7578","8924956","ALDRIDGE, GEORGINA ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","111790"," ","80652","31138"," "," ",

As PD progressescognitive and speech symptoms become increasingly prevalent heavily compromising quality of life andoften leading to loss of independence and placement in nursing homes. Few interventions improve thesedehumanizing aspects of PD and current therapies for motor symptoms such as levodopa and deepbrain stimulation (DBS) do not improve and can even worsen cognition and speech. To mitigate thesedeficits a better understanding of the basic mechanisms leading to abnormal cognition and speech in PDis needed. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for goal-directed planning of temporally sensitivebehavioral sequences essential for cognition and speech. In PD patients the PFC is thinned and ourpublished work demonstrates that PFC 4 Hz rhythms are decreased. Furthermore PD involves diversepathophysiological processes such as disrupted dopamine acetylcholine and synuclein. There is acritical need to understand how PD disrupts the PFC and leads to cognitive and speech symptoms. Thisknowledge will inspire new biomarkers and targeted treatments for non-motor symptoms of PD.The goal of the proposed Exploratory Grant is to catalyze novel collaborations that will lead to an UdallCenter of Excellence. We will test the overall hypothesis that decreased dopamine-dependent PFC 4 Hzactivity impairs cognition and speech in PD. We will identify cellular and circuit mechanisms underlyingPFC function and dysfunction in preclinical rodent models and in human PD patients. We will harnesscomplementary and convergent cutting-edge techniques such as cell-type-specific 2-photon imaging ofthe PFC in behaving animals human intraoperative neurophysiology brain imaging and brainconnectivity. Common research themes focus on the PFC in cognitive and speech symptoms of PDneuronal oscillations and neuronal circuits.

In the parent project we are investigating thetime course mechanism and mitigation of retinal microvasculopathy as a driver of radiation-induced neuraldegeneration and functional loss to facilitate earlier detection prevention and treatment of radiation-associatedretinal damage. Here we propose that radiation therapy (RT)-induced dementia is driven by the samemicrovascular processes and molecular mechanisms as within the retina and that retinal laser speckleflowgraphy (LSFG) can be used as an early detection strategy. Importantly Vascular CognitiveImpairment/Dementia is listed under Related Dementias under the NIH Coding definitions for Alzheimer'sdisease and its related Dementias. Thus the research proposed herein is directly relevant to NOT-AG-20-034. Radiation-induced cognitive impairment occurs in up to 90% of adult survivors of brain tumors. Manyadverse side effects of RT have been attributed to damage of microvascular endothelium that is initiated byexcessive production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial injury during RT and leads to endothelialdysfunction and loss of capillaries over a period of years. However similar to vision loss after RT the conceptthat microangiopathy is a driver of radiation-related dementia has not been conclusively established. This is inpart because early indicators of microvascular endothelial dysfunction that predict later cognitive decline haveyet to be established. In our parent R01 we are using laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) as a novel non-invasive modality to detect early RT-induced microangiopathy. Here we propose to deploy the experimentalapproaches and genetic models of our parent R01 to analyze cerebral structure and function. The objectives of the proposed project are to facilitate earlier detection and treatment of RT-associateddementia. Specifically we expect to develop non-invasive tests in mice for the early detection of RT-inducedinjury based on altered blood flow and determine whether early endothelial dysfunction is predictive of asubsequent reduction in capillary density and neuronal dysfunction. We also anticipate identifying themolecular mechanism of radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction and its impact on cognitive impairment. As in the parent R01 the application of LSFG will enable us to identify early radiation endotheliopathybefore capillary loss and to test molecular mechanisms to ultimately develop novel therapies. Our centralhypothesis is that post-radiation endothelial dysfunction is driven by mitochondrial oxidative stress andis predictive of the severity of subsequent capillary dropout and neuronal damage. Capitalizing on ourimaging protocols we will (1) establish whether early impairment of the microvascular endothelial functionpredicts microvessel dropout and neuronal dysfunction after RT and (2) test whether selective inhibition ofmitoROS production in endothelium prevents the early reduction of blood flow and loss of capillaries after RT.","Adult;Aftercare;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Biological Assay;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Blood capillaries;Blood flow;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cerebral cortex;Cerebrum;Code;Cranial Irradiation;Data;Dementia;Development;Dropout;Early Diagnosis;Early treatment;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Extravasation;Funding;Genetic Models;Goals;Health;Hemorrhage;Image;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Infusion procedures;Injury;Lasers;Lead;Light;Mediator of activation protein;Microcirculation;Mission;Mitochondria;Modality;Molecular;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neuronal Dysfunction;Neurons;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Parents;Patients;Prevention;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research;Research Support;Retina;Severities;Stress;Structure;Survivors;Testing;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Vascular Cognitive Impairment;Vasodilation;base;cerebral microvasculature;cohort;density;disability;early detection biomarkers;endothelial dysfunction;functional loss;genetic approach;insight;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutics;parent project;prevent;programs;radiation-induced injury;retinal damage;side effect;targeted treatment","Laser speckle flowgraphy as early indicator of microvasculopathy in radiation-induced cognitive decline","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research aims at dissecting the mechanisms of endothelial injury that lead to dementia/cognitivedecline and vision loss in patients after radiation therapy.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","Protein misfolding is central to the pathology of the debilitating age-related diseases such as ALS Alzheimer'sParkinson's and Huntington's diseases that are increasing in our society today. Activating the heat shocktranscription factor HSF1 a transcription factor conserved across all kingdoms of life and responsible for theexpression of molecular chaperones and other pro-survival gene products results in a dramatic amelioration ofthe toxic effects of protein aggregation in animal models of proteinopathies. The activation of HSF1 was longunderstood to be an autonomous response of cells triggered by the increase in misfolded protein species. Yetin tissues of patients suffering from the age-related neurodegenerative diseases cells accumulate misfoldedproteins but do not activate HSF1 to effectively counteract protein aggregation and toxicity. Thusunderstanding how to activate HSF1 in situ could provide a powerful means to intervene inproteinopathies. Our recent studies have demonstrated that increases in the neuromodulator serotonin actingthrough the G-protein coupled 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) can activate HSF1 and increase molecular chaperoneexpression. Our preliminary data further show that serotonergic signaling is sufficient to decrease intracellularprotein inclusions of polyQ expansion proteins in cultured mammalian cell models. Based on these excitingstudies we propose to test the hypothesis that modulating serotonergic signaling through 5-HT4R can protectagainst proteinopathies in a mouse model of Huntington's Disease by activating HSF1 and intend to dissect theintracellular mechanisms underlying such protection. If successful our studies will establish a rational basis forexploring the role for 5-HT4R agonists in the protection against devastating neurodegenerative diseases of agingand provide evidence that serotonin-dependent changes in motivational state can modulateproteinopathies.","Address;Affect;Aging;Agonist;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Animal Model;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Brain;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cell Culture System;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cell model;Cells;Cellular biology;Corpus striatum structure;Coupled;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Data;Dependence;Dependovirus;Disease;Doxycycline;Ensure;Experimental Designs;Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinases;GTP-Binding Proteins;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Gene Expression;Genes;Glutamine;Goals;Heat shock factor;Human;Huntington Disease;In Situ;Intervention;Intraperitoneal Injections;Life;Mammalian Cell;Measures;Mediating;Mental Depression;Metabolism;Modeling;Molecular Chaperones;Motivation;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuromodulator;Neurons;Parkinson Disease;Pathology;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Proteins;Publishing;Regulation;Role;Serotonin;Serotonin Agonists;Serotonin Receptors 5-HT4;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;Societies;Stress;Symptoms;Synapses;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Work;age related;age related neurodegeneration;base;cohort;density;experimental study;familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;gene product;heat shock transcription factor;in vitro Model;in vivo;misfolded protein;motor behavior;mouse model;mutant;nerve stem cell;neuropsychiatric disorder;polyglutamine;programs;protein aggregation;protein folding;protein misfolding;proteostasis;response;superoxide dismutase 1;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;translational impact","Role of serotonergic-activation of heat shock transcription factor in the regulation of age-related protein misfolding and toxicity in mammalian systems","Proteinopathies such as ALS Alzheimer's Disease Parkinson's Disease and Huntington's Disease aredebilitating age-related diseases of protein misfolding for which there are currently no interventions.

"Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Lung; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Prevention","AbstractSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with refractoryepilepsy. Emerging data indicate that a substantial percentage of SUDEP is due to seizure-induced respiratoryarrest. There is a gap in knowledge about how seizures cause apnea who is at highest risk and what can bedone to prevent it. We have found that postictal death is due to seizure-induced apnea in two genetic mousemodels of human SUDEP (Scn1aR1407X and Scn8aN1768D mice). Our data indicate that seizures activateprojections from the amygdala to the brainstem causing central apnea and transient defects in CO2homeostasis and serotonin (5-HT) neuron function. This is supported by data showing that 5-HT neuronswhich are central CO2/pH chemoreceptors that stimulate breathing are inhibited during seizures. The centralhypothesis of the current proposal is that seizures impair CO2 chemoreception in part by inhibiting 5-HTneurons which increases the risk of a seizure becoming fatal. We have also found that a diet supplementedwith milk whey causes a large reduction in the risk of SUDEP and this may be due to an increase in 5-HT.This proposal will use Scn1aR1407X and Scn8aN1768D mice to carry out the following specific aims. 1) Determinethe role of impaired CO2 chemoreception in fatal post-ictal apnea. Working hypothesis: Seizures inhibit CO2chemoreception which increases the risk of fatal apnea. Our preliminary data indicate that generalizedseizures cause a large post-ictal decrease in ventilation a decrease in the hypercapnic ventilatory response(HCVR) and a transient drop in body temperature. All three of these homeostatic brainstem functions arecontrolled by serotonin neurons. We will use 24-hour monitoring of EEG EMG EKG plethysmography bodytemperature and video in a mouse epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) to study changes due to spontaneousseizures. 2) We will define the contribution of 5-HT system dysfunction to postictal hypoventilation and apnea.Working hypothesis: Impairment of the 5-HT system worsens ictal and post-ictal hypoventilation. A decrease inbrain 5-HT has been shown to decrease the HCVR. We will increase or decrease brain 5-HT in mice andmeasure the frequency of spontaneous sudden death and postictal changes in the HCVR. 3) Define themechanisms by which whey prevents SUDEP. Working hypothesis: SUDEP risk is reduced by whey via anincrease in brain 5-HT and/or CO2 chemoreception. We propose to examine whether whey is effective inpreventing seizure-induced death in Scn8aN1768D Kcna1-null and DBA/1 mice. We will examine whether wheyprevents inhibition of the HCVR with seizures. We will examine which components have a protective effect onsurvival and whether they act through changes in 5-HT. The expected outcome is that CO2 chemoreceptionwill be established as central to the mechanisms of SUDEP and to how whey protects against it. The broaderimpact is that whey may be a new and safe approach to prevent SUDEP that targets mechanisms underlyingpostictal respiratory arrest.","5-Hydroxytryptophan;Aftercare;Age;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Anticonvulsants;Apnea;Arousal;Body Temperature;Brain;Brain Stem;Breathing;Carbon Dioxide;Cause of Death;Central Sleep Apnea;Cessation of life;Chemoreceptors;DBA/1 Mouse;Data;Defect;Diet;Dietary Supplementation;Drops;Electrocardiogram;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Generalized seizures;Genetic;Goals;Homeostasis;Hour;Hypercapnic respiratory failure;Impairment;Incidence;Intractable Epilepsy;Knowledge;Measures;Microdialysis;Milk;Monitor;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Neurons;Outcome;Patients;Plethysmography;Prevention;Preventive treatment;Respiration Disorders;Risk;Role;SCN8A gene;Seizures;Serotonergic System;Serotonin;Sudden Death;Testing;Tryptophan 5-monooxygenase;Ventilatory Depression;Weaning;common treatment;comorbidity;defined contribution;dietary;experimental study;high risk;human model;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;mouse model;neurochemistry;optogenetics;prevent;protective effect;respiratory;response;sudden cardiac death;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy;ventilation","Prevention of SUDEP by milk whey: Role of CO2 chemoreception and serotonin","Project NarrativeSUDEP is a major cause of death in patients with epilepsy and in many cases is thought to be due to postictalrespiratory depression.

"Wound Healing and Care","ABSTRACTThe goal of this project is to use engineered extracellular matrix environments leveraging structural and me-chanical control over the extracellular matrix to examine the mechanisms by which cells respond to multipledirectional migration cues. Cell migration plays an important role in many physiological and pathological pro-cesses such as wound healing development and cancer invasion. Frequently migration is not simply randombut directed towards targets through recognition of aligned extracellular matrix fibers or gradients in stiffnessgenerating contact guidance and durotaxis respectively. In many biological contexts these cues are presentedsimultaneously forcing cells to integrate this information. For instance gradients of stiffness and aligned colla-gen are generated within the wound bed to direct dermal fibroblast migration. Similar fiber structures and gra-dients stimulate cancer cell migration out of the tumor microenvironment and normal cells including stromaland immune cells towards the tumor microenvironment. While there is a firm understanding of how cells re-spond to individual directional cues virtually nothing is known about how cells integrate multiple cues andmake migrational decisions based on that integration. Furthermore there is a hypothesis that contact guidanceand durotaxis are overlapping directional cell migration mechanisms but this has not been rigorously tested.Mechanistic understanding of multi-cue directional migration will require a refined understanding of how the F-actin and microtubule networks operates. Indeed some evidence suggests that contact guidance and durotax-is may use slightly different F-actin network structures since contact guidance is thought to be governed by F-actin fiber structures but durotaxis is not. Engineering approaches will be taken to design in vitro environmentsthat allow for independent tuning of contact guidance and durotaxis in both 2D and 3D environments. Further-more the effect of F-actin branching bundling and contraction in allowing cells to prefer aligned fibers of colla-gen or gradients of stiffness will be tested. This will uncover shared or competing molecular pathways involvedwhen these two directional migration cues are present in isolation and together. Understanding how cells mi-grate in response to multiple cues has broad impact on several biomedical fields including tissue engineeringand disease therapeutics. Determining how cells respond to multiple cues in vitro will allow us to predict cellresponses in wound healing development cancer invasion and immune response leading to drug candidatesas in cancer or strategies to enhance wound healing and immune response.","3-Dimensional;Actinin;Adhesions;Alginates;Biological;Bundling;Cells;Cicatrix;Collagen;Collagen Fiber;Collagen Fibril;Complex;Coupled;Cues;Decision Making;Dermal;Development;Disease;Drug Targeting;Engineering;Environment;Extracellular Matrix;F-Actin;Fiber;Fibroblasts;Gel;Goals;Growth;Immune;Immune response;In Vitro;Individual;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Microtubules;Molecular;Myosin Type II;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal Cell;Out-Migrations;Pathologic;Pathologic Processes;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Play;Process;Research;Role;Rotation;Structure;Sum;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissue Engineering;Work;base;cancer cell;cell motility;cell type;chronic wound;crosslink;design;directional cell;drug candidate;drug discovery;flexibility;imprint;in vivo;insight;mechanical properties;migration;next generation;predictive marker;preference;response;self assembly;synergism;transmission process;traumatic wound;tumor microenvironment;virtual;wound bed;wound dressing;wound healing","Cell Migration Control through Modulation of Multiple Directional Cues","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research seeks to use engineered cell environments to determine how cells make migrationdecisions when several pieces of contradictory information are presented an important process duringdevelopment wound healing and cancer.

"Genetics","Androgen receptor is a powerful sex-steroid hormone receptor that mediates homeostatic and pathologicalfunctions in hormone-responsive systems in humans. Over the past 30 years since the original cloning of theandrogen receptor cDNA molecular insights into androgen receptor function both normal and pathologicalhave been gleaned from the discovery of proteins that bind and regulate androgen receptor activity. Theseandrogen receptor-interacting proteins better known as the AR-interactome constitute a functionally diversespectrum of proteins that modulate androgen receptor function in space and time at the cellular level. Likeother sex-steroid hormone receptor family members androgen receptor is a very sticky receptor. It has morethan 350 binding partners which allows androgen receptor to serve as a hub to regulate cellular signaling atthe molecular level through dynamic protein interactions with the AR-interactome. Unfortunately the AR-interactome continues to grow over time with no clear end in sight. Our inability to define the AR-interactome ina single cellular model has made it nearly impossible to experimentally replicate the AR-interactome andunderstand how their coordinated actions regulate AR-dependent signaling in space and time. Thusquantitative and predictive models of AR-dependent signaling remain speculative at best. Our scientificpremise is that the careful annotation and discovery of the AR-interactome in cells will lay the foundation forunderstanding how this subproteome contributes to physiologic and pathologic androgen receptor functions inhormone-responsive systems. Thus we have proposed an experimental plan to annotate the AR-interactomein androgen-sensitive cellular models using cutting-edge quantitative proteomic techniques. Our proteomicapproaches will define a spatiotemporal map of the AR-interactome in cells and lay the foundation for probinggenetic relationships within and between protein complexes comprising the AR-interactome. The proteomicfindings will allow us to develop testable models of AR-dependent signaling in cellular systems. These modelswill provide a molecular framework to understand how androgen-mediated signaling operates underhomeostatic and pathological states. More importantly they will guide the discovery of novel druggable targetsamong the AR-interactome so that corrupted AR-dependent signaling can be attenuated in androgen receptor-related pathologies that afflict reproductive and non-reproductive systems in humans.","Androgen Receptor;Androgens;Attenuated;Behavior;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biomedical Research;Biotin;Castration;Cell model;Cells;Cloning;Color;Communication;Communities;Complementary DNA;Coupled;Data;Data Set;Disease;Family member;Foundations;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Glean;Goals;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Health;Hormone Responsive;Human;Kinetics;Knowledge;LNCaP;Label;Length;Life;Ligand Binding Domain;Ligands;Ligation;Light;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Probes;Molecular Structure;Motor Neurons;Musculoskeletal System;Nature;Nuclear Hormone Receptors;Organ;Organism;Outcome;Pancreas;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Prostate;Prostatic Neoplasms;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;RIPK1 gene;RNA Splicing;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Research;Research Proposals;Resistance;Resolution;Resources;Signal Transduction;System;Techniques;Testing;Testis;Time;Tissues;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Vision;androgen sensitive;base;cellular development;disability;druggable target;guided inquiry;insight;new therapeutic target;non-genomic;novel;predictive modeling;prostate cancer cell;protein complex;receptor;receptor function;reproductive;reproductive organ;response;spatiotemporal;spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy;steroid hormone receptor","Construction of the Androgen Receptor Interactome: A Molecular Framework for Probing Genetic Interactions in Androgen-Dependent Signaling","This research application is relevant to the public health because it will characterize an importantgroup of proteins called androgen receptor-interacting proteins which bind androgen receptor tomodulate androgen-mediated functions in reproductive organs including the testes and prostategland as well non-reproductive systems such as the pancreas musculoskeletal system and motorneurons.

The causative role of mitochondrial DNA is implicatedin a myriad of human diseases and disorders. However human mitochondrial dysfunction studies suffer fromthe absence of an ideal eukaryotic model. The well-studied model yeast S. cerevisiae is unsuitable due to itsmitochondrial physiology deviating too far from humans. We propose developing a new promising model toheighten knowledge of human mtDNA yielding new insights on mitochondrial dysfunction and pathogenicity.We have identified that Yarrowia lipolytica strikes a perfect balance between practicality (i.e. low cost andquick timescale of genetic manipulations as a low eukaryote) and tractability (i.e. mirroring human's obligateaerobic needs). In addition the overwhelming majority of current mitochondrial dysfunction studies focus solelyon nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene abnormalities. This is mainly attributed to the fact that the explosiveprogression of nuclear genome editing technology in the epoch of post-CRISPR has yet to translate tomtDNA editing. We propose leveraging a recently discovered stem-loop RNA motif to overcome nucleic acidimport limitations  the largest technical barrier to the development of CRISPR-associated technologies. If thisstrategy proves effective we envision that many mtDNA manipulation tools will be developed by research labsaround the globe following the same trajectory as the CRISPR nuclear genome manipulation revolution. Over the next five years in addition to the foundational tool development we will strive for elucidatingmtDNA-phenotype relationships in the new model. The ability of Y. lipolytica to accumulate lipids makes it aparticularly suitable model for human adipocytes. Mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue is involved in abroad spectrum of epidemics plaguing human health. Mediated by our development of a mitochondrial genetictoolkit we will reconstitute mtDNA-associated human pathologies in a precise manner enabling tailored drugdevelopment and all the subsequent mechanistic studies. Moreover we propose studying the impact ofmodulating the fluidity of the inner mitochondrial membrane on altering mitochondrial physiology which willlead to the discovery of potential treatments of obesity-related diseases in the future. Lastly along a sideresearch branch we will integrate the developed mitochondrial genetic toolkit with our previous efforts inmetabolic engineering. We will leverage the multiplicity of mitochondria in a single cell as well as the high copynumber of mtDNA in a single mitochondrion to boost the dosage of the gene encoding the rate-limiting step ina biochemical pathway. This strategy will revolutionize the metabolic engineering design of eukaryotic hosts toproduce a wide variety of compounds derived from TCA cycle or whose biosynthetic mechanism requires ahigh ATP input. Altogether this MIRA for ESI project will enable me to move into research areas distinct frommy existing ones and grant me the flexibility to follow important new research directions as opportunities arise.","Adipocytes;Adipose tissue;Aerobic;Area;Biochemical Pathway;Biology;Cells;Citric Acid Cycle;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Development;Disease;Epidemic;Equilibrium;Eukaryota;Foundations;Functional disorder;Future;Gene Abnormality;Gene Dosage;Genetic;Genome;Grant;Health;Human;Human Pathology;Inner mitochondrial membrane;Iowa;Knowledge;Lipids;Mediating;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial DNA;Modeling;Nuclear;Nucleic Acids;Obesity associated disease;Pathogenicity;Phenotype;Physiology;RNA;Research;Role;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Side;Study models;Technology;Therapeutic;Translating;Universities;Yarrowia lipolytica;Yeast Model System;cost;drug development;engineering design;flexibility;fluidity;genetic manipulation;genome editing;human disease;insight;metabolic engineering;mitochondrial dysfunction;novel;obesity treatment;reconstitution;stem;tool;tool development","Establishing a Novel Instrumental Model for Elucidating Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Dysfunction and Pathogenicity","Project Narrative The project seeks to develop a comprehensive and tractable mitochondrial manipulation toolkit in a newyeast model that more closely resembles human mitochondrial biology enhancing tractability of the findings inlower eukaryote testbeds to humans.

"Biotechnology","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe objective in this application is to exploit stereochemically robust thioamides at any point in the peptide se-quence as biophysical probes to address current barriers in peptide synthesis folding and drug discovery.There is a perception that current methods to incorporate thioamides into peptides are sufficient. However asan example the rapid racemization of the alpha-carbon stereochemistry of thioamide residues during synthesisbelies that perception. Indeed a survey of reported peptides containing thioamides points to these limitations.The majority of successful sequences incorporate the thioamide close to the N-terminus where exposure tosynthetic reagents is necessarily minimized during Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) procedures.Thus the instability of thioamides during Fmoc SPPS present a significant barrier to the synthesis and evalua-tion of thioamide peptides and restricts the sequence space in which thioamides can be employed. Anecdotalreports indicate that many labs have wished to employ thioamides in a variety of peptide studies but a lack ofdocumented pitfalls and synthetic options leads to intractable peptide products and ultimately abandonmentof such ventures. The approach in this proposal is to protect the thioamide in analogy to the protection of thefunctional groups of amino acid side chains in order to preserve the thioamide moiety during peptide elonga-tion. The rationale for this approach is that thioamide protection can be easily included within the standardSPPS work-flow to enable novel applications in peptide synthesis backbone modification and protein-druginteractions. The research plans of this project will exploit thioamides to probe protein folding and site-selectiveinsertion other chemistries. Thioamides will be employed in previously uncharted sequence space to addressfundamental questions in protein folding. We will also develop methods to transform thioamides into functionalgroups that will unlock new constrained peptide scaffolds. Peptides with persistent structure hold tremendouspromise as therapeutics to bridge the performance gap between small molecules and biologics. Finally thiswork will identify strategies to interrogate and target therapeutically relevant protein-protein interfaces. Interac-tions between hydrogen bond donors and acceptors of the main-chain of a peptide and a protein binding targetare underutilized in drug design. Based on structural bioinformatics new strategies to identify underutilized in-teractions at protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) will assist in the design of more potent inhibitors. Other work willalso develop new tools to interrogate PPIs for which very little structural information may be available to informfuture experimental design. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departurefrom the status quo by developing and employing new methods to preserve thioamide stability which promisesto unlock new research horizons. The contribution is significant because it is expected to have broad im-portance in both the study of protein folding and the development of bioactive molecules.","Address;Amino Acids;Basic Science;Binding Proteins;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biophysics;Carbon;Chemistry;Development;Diagnosis;Drug Design;Drug Interactions;Evaluation;Experimental Designs;Exposure to;Future;Hydrogen Bonding;Methods;Mission;Modification;Peptide Synthesis;Peptides;Perception;Performance;Phase;Prevention;Procedures;Proteins;Public Health;Reagent;Reporting;Research;Side;Site;Solid;Structure;Surveys;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Thioamides;United States National Institutes of Health;Vertebral column;Work;base;design;drug discovery;functional group;human disease;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;knowledge base;novel;preservation;programs;protein folding;protein function;racemization;scaffold;small molecule;stereochemistry;targeted treatment;tool","Peptide backbone modifications to enhance and study protein folding and binding","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research is relevant to public health because new methods to support basic research andfundamental studies in protein folding and function are expected to open new avenues for therapeuticintervention.

Nearly 25% of patientsdie within 3 years of diagnosis likely due to a high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events: myocardial infarction(MI) or stroke. A significantly larger proportion experience disability due to leg pain poor mobility and amputation.The cost of PAD-related hospital care alone exceeds $21 billion. However research regarding long-term survivalCV and limb outcomes in PAD and the impact of existing treatments remain limited in large part due to the pooraccuracy of PAD diagnosis codes. Our team has developed a novel approach using natural language processing(NLP) to identify PAD patients with a high degree of accuracy within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).Significance: The Peripheral Artery Disease: Long-term Survival & Outcomes Study (PEARLS) study willadvance scientific knowledge for PAD in several ways. We will use our NLP tool to assemble one of the largestcohorts of PAD in the world and follow them long-term to assess the trajectory of survival and clinical outcomesevaluate utilization of recommended treatments (medications risk factor control and revascularization) and theassociation of above treatments with the above outcomes. Collectively our work will address important gaps inPAD research and yield insights regarding strategies to improve care delivery in this high-risk population.Innovation: The use of an informatics-based method to assemble a cohort of newly diagnosed PAD patients ina large integrated health system is highly innovative.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYPolymicrobial communities are ubiquitous in the human body and their behaviors are critical drivers of bothhealth and disease. Bacteria are social organisms; thus the behavior of the group is driven not only by thecomposition of the community but also by interactions between the constituents and their surroundingenvironment. A key principle shared among all communities is that space matters. Groups organize to maximizeacquisition of goods minimize exposure to toxic compounds and optimize communication. Our recent datareveal bacteria can communicate with members of distant species and respond by changing how they spatiallystructure their communities. My laboratory seeks to understand how bacteria communicate between species byobserving them in their native environment tracking their movements and listening to and decoding theirlanguages.We utilize Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most notoriously problematic opportunistic pathogen in multiple typesof polymicrobial infections including chronic wounds and lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Werecently reported that P. aeruginosa establishes infections with other important pathogens in the lungs of patientswith CF for decades remaining unresponsive to intense antibiotic therapies and causing lung decline and earlydeath.In this proposal we begin by visualizing the spatial landscape of polymicrobial communities in situ intransplanted lungs from CF patients and animal models of polymicrobial infection. By combining next-generationtissue clearing and fluorescent in situ hybridization we are able to visualize the spatial positioning of species ona range of spatial scales in relation to each other and host structures. This will yield an unprecedented view ofmicrobes during infection and provide a platform for visualizing communities in other organs rich in polymicrobialcommunities such as the gastrointestinal tract.Next we will systematically decode the interspecies signaling language. We designed high-throughput screensto identify genes necessary for signaling and the repertoire of signaling molecules. Using live-imaging techniquespioneered by my lab we visualize and track the movement of bacterial cells gene expression and dynamics ofmotility appendages upon modulation of the identified pathways. Initial studies reveal P. aeruginosa respondsby activating multiple signaling systems which tune the direction of movement and activate virulence systems.Collectively these studies will construct a comprehensive picture of interspecies communication and enlightenhow interactions exacerbate disease.","Animal Model;Antibiotic Therapy;Bacteria;Behavior;Cells;Cessation of life;Communication;Communities;Data;Disease;Distant;Environment;Exposure to;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Gene Expression;Genes;Health;Human;Human body;Image;Imaging Techniques;In Situ;Individual;Infection;Laboratories;Language;Lung;Lung Transplantation;Lung infections;Microbe;Movement;Nature;Organ;Organism;Pathway interactions;Patients;Poison;Positioning Attribute;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Reporting;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Structure;System;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Tissues;Viral;Virulence;Wound Infection;appendage;bacterial community;cell motility;chronic wound;cystic fibrosis patients;design;genetic approach;high throughput screening;human disease;interspecies communication;member;microbial;next generation;opportunistic pathogen;pathogen;respiratory;social","Decoding interspecies signaling networks and the biogeography of polymicrobial infections","NARRATIVEWhile historically infections have been attributed to individual pathogens polymicrobial communities are nowknown to be common in human disease and can be composed of multiples species of bacterial viral and fungalorigin.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/AbstractRecent advances make the possibility of gene editing for lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) a promisingtherapeutic approach. Several designer nucleases can now be engineered to introduce site-specific doublestrand breaks in DNA allowing therapeutic modifications at specific genomic loci. A major barrier to progress isthe lack of efficient methods to deliver gene editing reagents to airway epithelia in vivo. We will use novelamphiphilic peptides to deliver CRISPR nuclease proteins and guide RNAs (termed ribonucleoproteins RNPs).The overall goal of this proposal is to advance gene editing as a therapeutic approach for diseases of therespiratory tract that impact the function of airway epithelial cells using a novel peptide-based deliverytechnology. Our preliminary studies show that these peptides can rapidly and efficiently deliver RNPs. Wetherefore hypothesize that therapeutically relevant levels of gene editing can be achieved in airway epithelia.In Phase 1 we use RNPs and amphipathic peptide delivery to perform gene editing in cultured human airwayepithelial cells and the airways of transgenic mice. Our aims include: 1) Completing an in vitro to screen todiscover new amphiphilic peptides with improved RNP delivery efficiency. 2) Quantifying the genome editingefficiency in cultured human airway epithelia and mouse airways following amphiphilic peptide mediateddelivery of RNPs. This includes the cell types transduced and the efficiency of editing. We will also assessediting and persistence of progenitor cells types. 3) Investigate the safety and toxicity of amphiphilic peptides inhuman airway epithelia and mouse airways including biodistribution immune response and pulmonaryhistopathology. Phase 2 will use RNPs and peptide delivery to perform gene editing in airways of newborntransgenic pigs. These studies build on our extensive experience working with a CF pig model. The aimsinclude: 1) Design and implement peptide and protein scale up and for peptide-mediated delivery of RNPs topig airways. 2) Quantify the cell targeting and editing efficiency of RNPs following in vivo RNP delivery usingamphiphilic peptides. We will identify the long lived and progenitor cell types transduced in the large and smallairways and investigate their persistence over time. 3) Investigate the safety and toxicity of candidate peptidesand RNPs in the pig lung.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Biodefense; Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","AbstractChemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs) are increasingly used to attack civilians worldwide. The sarin attacksin Tokyo and Syria and VX attack in Malaysia and England prove the real threat of CWNA. CWNA exposureimpacts human health globally but we lack effective treatment for survivors. Until recently preventing acutedeath due to CWNA exposure was a top priority. However addressing the long-term effects is also crucialgiven that survivors of sarin attacks though hospitalized and treated with conventional therapy developedseizures and cognitive motor and psychological impairments. Like organophosphates (OP) CWNAs arecholinesterase inhibitors and potent seizurogenics. In animal models acute CWNA or OP exposure inducesstatus epilepticus (SE) and other cholinergic symptoms. The current medical countermeasures (MCM-atropine oxime and diazepam or midazolam) do not prevent long-term neurotoxicity and comorbidity whichare primarily due to persistent neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Our overarching hypothesis isthat neuroprotectant/s in combination with MCM will effectively counteract NA-induced long-term neurotoxicityand restore brain function. We propose two novel neuroprotectants; saracatinib (SAR/AZD0530 a Src kinaseinhibitor) and 1400W (an inducible NO synthase inhibitor). Both demonstrated significant neuroprotective anddisease-modifying effects in kainate (KA) and DFP (a soman surrogate) rat models of chronic epilepsy. Bothtested in humans for other indications and no adverse effects were reported. Histology of brain sections fromanimal models confirmed that the test drugs significantly reduced neuroinflammation and neurodegenerationthe most common features of CWNA exposure that follows SE. We had administered both drugs (separately)and the MCM after DFP/KA/soman exposure in animals to mimic an ""after field evacuation and in-hospital""scenario (FOA). As expected MCM alone did not prevent DFP/KA-induced neurodegeneration seizures andneurobehavioral deficits. When neuroprotectant was administered as a follow-on therapy we could mitigateDFP/KA/soman-induced brain pathology which provide the proof-of-concept for the neuroprotective strategyfor a CWNA exposure scenario. We will optimize both SAR and 1400W in rat DFP and soman models andvalidate in G. pig (soman) and rat VX models and determine the efficacy of single or combination of both drugsin mitigating neuropathology and behavioral deficits [Specific Aims (SA) 1-3]. We will conduct non-GLPPK/PD-toxicity studies and initiate drug development (SA 4) for intended use in humans (FOA). We will employunbiased long-term video-EEG studies to quantify seizures and epileptiform spikes and conduct MRI/PETscan stereology to determine neuronal loss and multiplex assay for neuroinflammatory cytokines. We willconduct a battery of behavioral tests at various time-points. This research addresses the CounterACT missioni.e. ""to foster and support research and development of new and improved therapeutics to mitigate the healtheffects of chemical threats.""

"Autoimmune Disease; Cancer; Coronaviruses; Hematology; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","The National Institutes of Health reports that > 23 million (~5-8%) of Americans suffer from chronicinflammatory conditions many of which involve the pathogenic functions of autoreactive B lymphocytes andthe autoantibodies they produce. Chronic inflammatory conditions also predispose to the subsequentdevelopment of malignancies such as B cell lymphoma in the affected cells and tissues. There is thus acritical window of opportunity in which alleviation of autoimmunity and chronic inflammation can also reducefuture risk of malignancies. However many of the current treatments for B cell-mediated autoimmunity globallydeplete B cells which can alleviate symptoms but result in immunosuppression. There is thus an ongoingneed for development and refinement of therapies that target the pathogenic function of autoreactive B cells.The adapter protein TNF Receptor Associated Factor 3 (TRAF3) acts in a cell-type-specific manner tosuppress B cell signaling pathways contributing to both autoimmunity and malignancy and loss of TRAF3protein in B cells by inflammation-induced degradation creates chronic B cell TRAF3 deficiency. Thisdeficiency in turn predisposes to abnormally enhanced B cell survival and function leading to autoimmunity inyoung adults in a preclinical mouse model and development of B cell lymphoma in these mice as they age.This highlights a critical need to define how TRAF3 regulates B cell functions the long-term goal of this work.The objective of this project is to address the knowledge gap of how TRAF3 regulates signals via the B cellantigen receptor (BCR) and the innate Toll-like Receptors (TLR) that are involved in autoimmunity via thefollowing Specific Aims: (1) Identify the molecular mechanisms by which TRAF3 restrains BCR signaling andBCR contributions to autoimmunity. (2) Define how TRAF3 inhibits B cell signals and functions of innateimmune Toll-like receptors (TLRs). (3) Determine how inhibition of TRAF3-regulated BCR and TLR signalingpathways impacts development of autoimmunity in B cell-specific TRAF3-deficient mice (B-Traf3-/-). Theexpected outcome of these studies is a detailed knowledge of how a deficiency in TRAF3 which is associatedwith both aging and chronic B cell activation contributes to B cell-mediated autoimmunity. This knowledge willbe valuable in selection and development of pathway-targeted therapies for autoimmune conditions.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Affect;Age;Aging;American;Animals;Antibody-Producing Cells;Appearance;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;B-Cell Activation;B-Cell Antigen Receptor;B-Cell Development;B-Cell Lymphomas;B-Lymphocytes;Blood Cells;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Line;Cell Survival;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Complex;Data;Development;Disease;Event;Future;Genetic;Goals;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Human;Immunologic Receptors;Immunosuppression;In Vitro;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interruption;Knowledge;Lead;Leukocytes;Life;Lymphoma;Lymphomagenesis;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Outcome Study;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphotransferases;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Protein Kinase;Proteins;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Reporting;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Risk;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;TNF receptor-associated factor 3;TNFRSF5 gene;Tissues;Toll-like receptors;United States National Institutes of Health;Virulence Factors;Work;aged;autoreactive B cell;autoreactivity;cancer cell;cell type;chronic inflammatory disease;effective therapy;in vivo;innate immune function;mouse model;pre-clinical;prevent;protein kinase D;receptor;receptor binding;receptor function;receptor-mediated signaling;reduce symptoms;stress disorder;targeted treatment;young adult","Regulation of B cell signaling in autoimmunity by TRAF3","The proposed project focuses upon a protein called TRAF3 that prevents abnormal survival and activation of Bcells the type of white blood cell that produces antibodies.

"No NIH Category available","ABSTRACTThe Mechanisms of Parasitism training program has been an ongoing program at the University of Iowa for 24sequential years. The program unites scientists working on different microbial systems and methods butaddressing similar questions about Parasitism i.e. the pathogenesis of microbial diseases. Our underlyinghypothesis is that protozoal helminthic bacterial and viral pathogens face similar obstacles in overcomingmammalian antimicrobial defenses establishing a niche in which they coexist asymptomatic in their host or leadto pathologic conditions (i.e. disease). Our premise is that the mechanisms through which one pathogen evadeskilling within the host provides insights into means through which other pathogens survive in their unique hostniche. Most definitely the methods used to investigate host interactions with different hosts overlap. There is along history of collaborative research and training among many laboratories at the University of Iowa andspecifically particularly between members of this Parasitism program. With this new application we haveexpanded our horizons to meet the growing need for collaborative expertise in applying rigorous approaches tothe study of host and pathogen genomes transcriptomes proteomes metabolomes microbiomes andphageomes drawing upon analyses of these massive data sets to generate hypotheses that address thecommon and unique mechanisms through which different microbes establish parasitism.This interdepartmental interdisciplinary program draws upon faculty members in eight departments and fourinterdisciplinary programs with homes in four Colleges (Medicine Public Health Engineering Liberal Arts) at theUniversity of Iowa. Our activities are aimed at inspiring and enhancing not only training of our students andpostdoctoral scholars but also enriching the collaborative interactions between faculty members with differentareas of expertise. In this submission we now add faculty with expertise in Metabolomics PhylogeneticsBioinformatics and Epidemiology to the faculty. Our current faculty members already have considerable depthin mechanisms of microbial virulence and host innate and adaptive immune responses. We aim to adopt andby default have our trainees adopt a more comprehensive view of the intricate relationships between hostmicrobe and environment that contributed to parasitism. Our prior trainees have been highly successful; 100%of those who are done with training have assumed positions in the biomedical sciences or related fields with54% holding tenure track university positions and 39% performing research in industry. In this application wepropose an enhanced approach to helping trainees develop their careers. We have been successful at recruitingminority candidates and propose means to enhance that even further. Overall we view this as a comprehensiveprogram to train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in diverse aspects of parasitism and to preparethem for productive careers in education industry scientific policy or biomedical research.","Training;parasitism","Training in Mechanisms of Parasitism","PROJECT NARRATIVEIt is important to understand the means by which microbes infect and cause disease in humans to discoverhow to control the waves of pestilence that have spread through regions of the world.

"No NIH Category available","Studies of the immune system over the last hundred+ years have demonstrated its critical importance todefense against pathogens and toxins; its role in asthma allergy and autoimmunity; and more recently how itcan be harnessed in the treatment of cancer. The routine appearance of viral bacterial and parasiticoutbreaks all point to the need for the development of new or better immune-based vaccines and a need forbetter understanding of how the immune system controls or contributes to disease. Likewise recent work inImmunology has increased our understanding of how the microbiome can contribute to or regulateautoimmune as well as infectious disease how immunoparalysis alters long-term outcomes after sepsis andother diseases and how manipulation of immune checkpoints can boost the immune response. Collectivelythese and other immune based studies have had a major impact on human health and led to the discovery ofnew therapies and vaccines.

"Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections","Project SummaryChlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) is the leading cause of non-congenital blindness and the most prevalent sexuallytransmitted bacterial infection in the world which if left untreated can result in severe consequences. Allchlamydiae are obligate intracellular bacteria and thus gaining entry into a host cell is essential for the pathogento complete its replicative cycle and proliferate. Despite the critical nature of the invasion process the molecularmechanisms and details regarding how C.t. forces its way into non-phagocytic cells remains a large knowledgegap. A major premise of the current model suggests that invasion is facilitated by delivery of prepackagedconventional type III secretion system (cT3SS) effector proteins into the host cell prior to pathogen entry. Wehypothesize that a subset of these cT3SS effectors coordinate active subversion of the host cytoskeleton throughdirect manipulation of key regulators of actin dynamics. New data from our laboratory indicates that the cT3SSeffector protein TmeA binds to the nucleation promoting factor N-WASP both of which we show are essentialfor invasion. In Aim 1 we will mechanistically determine how TmeA regulates N-WASP and determine whetherthis interaction promotes key membrane features that likely aid in bacterial entry such as; membrane rufflingpedestal formation and filopodial dynamics. Given the essential nature of invasion to bacterial proliferation andsurvival C.t. likely employs multiple measures for invasion. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the complex interplaybetween TarP TepP and TmeA and reveal the ultimate molecular effects of their effector function and describehow the seemingly disparate pathways targeted by these effectors converge to assure chlamydial invasion.Furthermore we will determine whether other cT3SS effectors only expressed in the invasive EB form ofchlamydia are necessary for invasion of non-phagocytic cells. Detailed characterization of the bacterial and hostproteins required to promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during C.t. invasion will provide a holisticview of how intracellular pathogens such as C.t. coordinate subversion of cytoskeletal regulators to invade hostcells.","ANGPTL2 gene;Actins;Address;Antibiotics;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Binding;Blindness;Cells;Cervical;Chlamydia;Chlamydia trachomatis;Complex;Cytoskeletal Modeling;Cytoskeleton;Data;Defect;Development;Disease Progression;EMS1 gene;Ensure;Filopodia;Genetic;Glean;Goals;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Human;Impairment;Incidence;Infection;Injections;Integration Host Factors;Invaded;Knowledge;Laboratories;Left;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Modeling;Molecular;Nature;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Prevalence;Process;Proliferating;Proteins;Recurrence;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Sexual Transmission;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Type III Secretion System Pathway;knock-down;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;pathogen;polymerization;recruit;tool;uptake","The role of secreted effector proteins in Chlamydia trachomatis invasion","Project NarrativeThe paucity of genetic tools for manipulation of Chlamydia trachomatis has significantly hindered our ability todefine bacterial and host factors that facilitate host cell invasion a process that is essential for bacterialproliferation and disease progression.

"Brain Disorders; Childhood Injury; Epilepsy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThere are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema which is a common consequence of multiplebrain insults including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury stroke metabolic derangements andseizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1000 live births is a type ofbrain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizuresand both correlate with long-term morbidity including cerebral palsy cognitive delay epilepsy vision loss anddeafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema which is characterized by the accumulation ofwater chloride (Cl-) and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during theneonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that resultand perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxicedema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovativeways to treat cytotoxic edema which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatalseizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have beendescribed in different cell types but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long-term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling resultsin neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs)move water along with Cl- in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesisis based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema.We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movementinto neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out ofcortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imagingtechniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in differenttransgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores in vitro and in vivo whilealtering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also we will use a noveldeep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncoverfundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling duringearly brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues onneuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edemawhich are currently lacking. Moreover our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that areassociated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration including trauma and stroke.","Age;Anions;Blindness;Blood flow;Brain;Brain Edema;Brain Injuries;Cations;Cell Death;Cells;Cerebral Palsy;Childhood Injury;Chlorides;Cognitive;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Edema;Epilepsy;Event;Foundations;Future;Goals;Human;Hypoxia;Imaging Techniques;In Vitro;Incidence;Ions;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Live Birth;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Movement;Nervous System Trauma;Neurons;Newborn Infant;Osmolar Concentration;Outcome;Oxygen;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacological Treatment;Pharmacology;Positioning Attribute;Public Health;Regulation;Reproducibility;Research;Resistance;Role;Seizures;Stroke;Swelling;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Trauma;Traumatic Brain Injury;United States National Institutes of Health;Water;Water Movements;base;cell type;cytotoxic;deafness;deep learning algorithm;deprivation;disability;drug development;excitotoxicity;extracellular;fluorophore;genetic manipulation;improved;in vivo;innovation;multiphoton imaging;neonatal brain;neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury;neonatal period;neonatal seizure;neonate;neuron loss;novel;prevent;symporter;water channel;water flow","Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead towater accumulation during cytotoxic edema a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries ofthe newborn resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures.

"Diabetes; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","Project Summary / AbstractObesity is a major contributor to the epidemic of metabolic diseases including dyslipidemia cardiovasculardisease and type II diabetes. Numerous studies suggest that increasing energy expenditure can effectivelydecrease body weight. However no current therapeutic compounds safely or selectively activate energyexpenditure. The endocrine hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) decreases body weight duringobesity by increasing energy expenditure without affecting physical activity. Moreover FGF21 potentlydecreases both fat and body mass in obese animals and human patients. However the mechanism forFGF21-mediated increases in energy expenditure has not been identified. Work from our lab and others havedemonstrated that FGF21 acts in the central nervous system to promote weight loss. In addition several linesof evidence suggest that FGF21 requires intact signaling from the adipose-derived hormone leptin to elicit itsfull effects on driving weight loss. Finally our preliminary data demonstrates that the obligate FGF21 co-receptor -klotho is expressed in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) primarysites of leptin action in the brain and that leptin activates signaling in -klotho-expressing cells in the VMH andARC. Thus we hypothesize that FGF21 signals at least in part to leptin-sensitive cells in the VMH and/orARC to modulate energy expenditure. This proposal employs novel genetic mouse models chemogeneticmanipulation of neurons and pharmacological approaches to investigate the crosstalk between FGF21 andleptin signaling in the central control of energy homeostasis. Through these studies we aim to identify noveltherapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity and obesity-associated disorders.","Acute;Adipocytes;Adipose tissue;Adult;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Automobile Driving;Back;Body Temperature;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Brain region;Brown Fat;Calcium;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cells;Data;Disease;Dyslipidemias;Electrophysiology (science);Endocrine;Energy Intake;Energy Metabolism;Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase;Epidemic;Fat Body;Genetic;Goals;Homeostasis;Hormonal;Hormones;Human;Hydrogen;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;Image;Inner mitochondrial membrane;Insulin;Knock-out;Leptin;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Mus;Nerve;Neuraxis;Neurons;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Obesity associated disease;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Pharmacogenetics;Pharmacology;Physical activity;Population;Process;Publishing;Regulation;Research;Signal Transduction;Site;Slice;Structure of nucleus infundibularis hypothalami;Therapeutic;Thermogenesis;Tissues;Work;analog;blood glucose regulation;cellular targeting;chemical release;fasting glucose;fibroblast growth factor 21;flexibility;glutamatergic signaling;improved;in vivo;innovation;insulin sensitivity;leptin receptor;metabolic rate;mitochondrial uncoupling protein;mouse model;neural circuit;neural network;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;obesity treatment;promoter;receptor;receptor expression;response;uncoupling protein 1","Regulation of Energy Homeostasis by FGF21","Project NarrativeThe proposed research aims at understanding a novel hormonal pathway that regulates body weight andmetabolic flexibility with the ultimate goal to develop new treatments for obesity and obesity-associateddiseases.

Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years making earlyintervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressivedisorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clearmania is absent. In fact BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis with 70%misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals iscomplex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications inpatients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that using resting fMRI we canpredict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work togeneralize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop in consultationwith multiple psychiatrists a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocoland machine learning analysis in a timely meaningful and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be animportant step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness.2","Algorithms;Antidepressive Agents;Back;Biological;Biological Markers;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Brain imaging;Businesses;Classification;Clinic;Clinical Decision Support Systems;Clinical Trials;Clinical assessments;Collaborations;Combination Medication;Communities;Community Surveys;Complex;Consultations;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Data Set;Demography;Depressed mood;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders;Differential Diagnosis;Disease remission;Early Intervention;Ensure;Evaluation;Face;Feedback;Financial cost;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Generations;Geographic Locations;Goals;Image;Individual;Intuition;Lead;London;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Manic;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Minority;Modernization;Mood Disorders;New Mexico;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Ontario;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Psychiatric Diagnosis;Psychiatrist;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research;Rest;Running;Scanning;Site;Societies;Standardization;Suicide;Surveys;Symptoms;Technology Transfer;Therapeutic;Time;Training;Universities;Validation;Work;accurate diagnosis;base;biomedical informatics;clinical care;clinical development;clinical trial readiness;cloud based;commercialization;computerized data processing;cost;data acquisition;data repository;data sharing;data tools;depressive symptoms;disability-adjusted life years;effective therapy;emerging adulthood;experience;high risk;imaging biomarker;machine learning method;member;mortality risk;neuroimaging;novel;precision medicine;quality assurance;response;support tools;tool;treatment planning;treatment response;treatment strategy;web portal","Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients","Project Narrative Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication which can also makethem worse (e.g. putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants).

"Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","Project SummaryFilariases are a group of neglected tropical diseases produced by infection with microfilaria of Clade IIIparasitic nematodes that are transmitted by biting insects. One example is the lymphatic filariasisproduced by Brugia malayi. Lymphatic filariasis is a debilitating and disfiguring disease which occurs in120 million people worldwide. Other filarial diseases are River Blindness produced by Onchocercavolvulus and loiasis produced by Loa loa. Prevention and treatment of these nematode parasite diseasesrelies on the use of anthelmintic drugs because no effective vaccines are available. Prophylaxis usingMass Drug Administration [MDA] programs are limited by the efficacy of existing anthelmintics.Diethylcarbamazine is a mainstay for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis and loiasis in most parts of theworld except in areas where onchocerciasis is present because it is contra-indicated by risks of blindness.Diethylcarbamazine produces rapid clearance of microfilaria and causes ~40% mortality of adult parasites(macrofilaricide). A number of studies have suggested that diethylcarbamazine has an indirect host-mediated mode of action and that diethylcarbamazine acts by changing host arachidonic acid pathways.We have observed that diethylcarbamazine has direct effects on filarial nematodes. We presentpreliminary observations that show that diethylcarbamazine increases the opening of TRP-2 channels inBrugia malayi and opening of calcium-activated SLO-1 K channels. The effect is a rapid transientinhibition of motility followed by recovery: the response accommodates.Emodepside is an emerging and important cyclooctadepsipeptide class of anthelmintic that also haseffects on microfilaria and adult filaria. Emodepside treatments could allow a major advance over existingmass drug administration (MDA) programs which require regular treatments to kill adult parasites. Oneof the sites of action of emodepside is on nematode SLO-1 K channels where opening of the channelsinhibits motility but it is not effective against all filaria. Here we propose to compare effects on filarial SLO-1 K channels from Brugia Onchocerca and Loa and to examine actions and interactions of these twodrugs to explore their mode of action.We have 3 aims:Aim #1: Characterize in vitro the concentration motility-inhibition-response relationships ofdiethylcarbamazine and emodepside and their combination on: A) Brugia microfilaria; B) Brugiaadult females; C) Brugia adult males.We will test the hypothesis that effects of diethylcarbamazineand emodepside are additive synergistic or antagonistic and dependent of life-cycle stage and sex.Aim #2 Characterize the SLO-1 K channel current responses to diethylcarbamazine andemodepside in isolated Brugia malayi muscle flaps under patch-clamp We will test the hypotheses:a) that the effects of emodepside and diethylcarbamazine interact; b) that the interactions ofdiethylcarbamazine and emodepside are dependent on the presence of TRP-2 by knockdown of TRP-2channels; and c) that TRP-2 and SLO-1 channel message & channel opening accommodates duringprolonged exposure to diethylcarbamazine or emodepside.Aim #3: Characterize the comparative molecular pharmacology of: a) different SLO-1 K channelsof Brugia malayi Onchocerca volvulus and Loa loa and; b) TRP-2 channels of Brugia malayi andLoa loa expressed in oocytes.We will test the hypothesis that the pharmacology and potencies ofemodepside and diethylcarbamazine on SLO-1 K channels and TRP-2 channels of Brugia Onchocercaand Loa are different and also different to a human channel homologue. We will examine channeldesensitization.The proposal is innovative using a combination of techniques to test the effects of diethylcarbamazineand emodepside on their putative target sites SLO-1 K channels of filarial. The overall impact of usingour mixture of techniques will be discovery and comparison of effects of diethylcarbamazine andemodepside on different species of filarial TRP-2 channels and SLO-1 K channels. Knowledge of themolecular actions of these drugs is required for: a) molecular detection of sensitivity of different filarialspecies and resistance; b) designing new drugs and combination therapies; c) predicting andunderstanding sensitivities of different nematode parasite species; and d) predicting possible host toxicity.","Adult;Adverse effects;African;Anthelmintics;Arachidonic Acids;Area;Basic Science;Blindness;Brugia;Brugia malayi;Calcium;Combined Modality Therapy;Development;Diethylcarbamazine;Disease;Disputes;Dopachrome isomerase;Evolution;Exposure to;Eye;Female;Filarial Elephantiases;Homologous Gene;Human;In Situ;In Vitro;Infection;Insecta;Intestinal Volvulus;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Larva;Life Cycle Stages;Loa;Loa loa;Loiasis;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Microfilaria;Molecular;Muscle;Nematoda;Nematode infections;Ocular Onchocerciasis;Onchocerca;Onchocerca volvulus;Onchocerciasis;Oocytes;Parasites;Parasitic nematode;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pharmacotherapy;Potassium Channel;Prevention;Prophylactic treatment;RNA Splicing;Recovery;Research;Resistance;Risk;Services;Site;Surgical Flaps;Techniques;Testing;Toxic effect;Variant;cell motility;comparative;desensitization;design;detection sensitivity;differential expression;drug action;filaria;gastrointestinal;human model;innovation;knock-down;male;mortality;neglected tropical diseases;novel therapeutics;patch clamp;phase II trial;programs;response;sex;success;vaccine access","Slo-1K channels TRP-2 channels emodepside and diethylcarbamazine in Filaria","Project NarrativeThe Neglected Tropical Diseases include filariases the parasitic nematode infectionstransmitted by biting insects.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARYIn the US major birth defects affect a delivery every 4 minutes and the morbidity and mortality of tens ofthousands of children annually. An environmental (i.e. non-inherited) exposure or causal gene variant isestimated to explain about one-third of all defects that occur. Since 1996 the Iowa Center for Birth DefectsResearch and Prevention (CBDRP) has played a leadership role in surveillance and research of major birthdefects. Our partnerships with the Iowa Department of Public Health and Iowa Registry for Congenital andInherited Disorders provide comprehensive and timely surveillance of deliveries to Iowa residents. With thesepartnerships we successfully enrolled mothers in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) andBirth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS) I. Using exposure data and biologicspecimens collected we made substantial contributions to birth defects epidemiology ranging from methodsdevelopment to identifying gene-environment interaction effects. Our work has provided critical insights intobirth defect etiology and been disseminated in high-impact journals. We propose to expand the work of theIowa CBDRP through successful participation in the BD-STEPS II. Our overall goal is to identify modifiablematernal exposures in early pregnancy which may increase the risk for having a pregnancy affected with amajor birth defect. We will expertly conduct comprehensive and timely data collection and reporting for the BD-STEPS II using our highly experienced surveillance and research infrastructures. Our proposed researchapproach is not only consistent with the BD-STEPS II required activities but expands and innovates theconceived study design (RFA-DD-18-001). We propose to address critical barriers identified in a recent reviewof the NBDPS to investigate modifiable risk factors for major birth defects. To accomplish this we will expandthe traditional epidemiology approach (used in the NBDPS and BD-STEPS) by integrating a multiomicssystems epidemiology approach. Our systems approach is novel in its application to NBDPS and BD-STEPSdata. It will use state of the art genomic analysis to lead to improved characterization of the case phenome andimproved delineation of pathways that influence birth defect development via the exposome. The expertise ofour key personnel and collaborating investigators along with access to rich exposure and biologic data fromindependent populations provides us with unique resources among all CBDRPs allowing us to successfullyimplement our systems approach. Additionally we will continue our leadership role and expand our training ofa future generation of birth defect researchers. Along with continuing to train pre-doctoral and postdoctoralscholars we will now include bachelors scholars. Our key personnel investigators and scholars will continueour high productivity in disseminating findings from NBDPS and BD-STEPS through peer-reviewedpublications.

Both AUD and ADRD are associated with chronic insomniabut to date no studies have linked alcohol-induced sleep disturbances to tau-based neuropathology in the brain.Sleep disruption also induces microglial activation and aging which can promote the spread of tau pathology inthe brain. In Aim 1 we will use EEG fiber photometry electrophysiology and DREADD-based manipulations ofneural activity in vivo in mice expressing human tau pathology (htau mice) to determine whether chronic alcoholexacerbates sleep deficits and whether enhanced neural activity in 5-HT neurons contributes to sleepdisruptions. In Aim 2 we will examine the effect of chronic alcohol on microglia and their contribution to theprogression of tau pathology in the DRN. In Aim 3 we will determine whether chronic alcohol can facilitate thespread of tau pathology from the DRN to other brain regions using an AAV-based strategy for expressing taupathology exclusively in 5-HT neurons. 3D immunolabeling and light sheet imaging using the iDISCO techniquewill be used to identify areas and quantify the extent of tau spread. We will also examine whether neural activityin 5-HT neurons and microglial activation contributes to this spread.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Neurosciences; Radiation Oncology","Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are enigmatic malignancies with an increasing incidence and poor outcomes (5-yrsurvival <30%). Recently peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using [177Lu]DOTATATE beta(b)-particletreatment (Lutathera) improved survival vs standard of care and was FDA approved. However objective tumorresponses were low (18%) in the Phase 3 trial. Nonetheless Lutathera developer AAA Inc. was subsequentlyacquired by Novartis for $3.9 Bln demonstrating the commercial potential and significance of PRRT products.Viewpoints next-generation PRRT employs alpha(a)-particle therapy an emergent form of PRRT that isproducing objective (and even complete) responses. Viewpoint and the University of Iowa have secured an NIHR01 (CA243014-01; Viewpoint CSO Michael Schultz is Co-PI) that supports a Phase 1 trial of Viewpoints[203/212Pb]VMT-a-NET for NET in human subjects (a-therapy to begin Oct. 2021). VMT-a-NET (patent nowpending) is innovative because rationally-designed molecular modifications (patents now pending)significantly improve radiolabeling in vitro cell/internalization binding (20-fold) Kd (up to 6-fold) and in vivo PKproperties that significantly improve tumor accumulation/retention and reduce other organ retention (e.g.tumor:kidney ratio increased 8-fold) compared to competing agents. Thus this research is significant becausenew predicate biomarker and efficacy data demonstrate a therapeutic window that can significantly improveoutcomes for NET patients. This research is further significant because Viewpoints proprietary 212Pbproduction device (VMT-a-GEN) establishes control of on-demand supply of 212Pb for commercialization. In thisrevised Direct to Phase II SBIR project Viewpoint will (i) procure GMP VMT-a-NET and conduct IND-enablingtoxicology prior to the therapy trial; and (ii) validate formulations and automate manufacturing of VMT-a-GEN.PREDICATE MILESTONES: Secured $1.2Mln seed financing; signed terms for Series A investment; validatedSST2R target; secured R01 for [203/212Pb]VMT-a-NET Phase 1 therapy trial; GMP kits for production; exclusivelicenses; secured 203Pb supply (Lantheus); working prototype of therapeutic isotope (212Pb) production device(VMT-a-GEN); VMT-a-GEN mfg. facilities established.

"Aging; Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Infectious Diseases; Minority Health; Rare Diseases; Wound Healing and Care","PROJECT SUMMARYThere is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of Bullous pemphigoid (BP)an autoimmune blistering disease of the elderly. Thus standard treatment consists of high doseimmunosuppression which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our long-term goal is toidentify the pathogenic mechanisms of BP so that targeted therapies can be developed resulting in improvedefficacy decreased off-target effects and a reduced healthcare burden. The objective of this proposal is todefine the role of bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus aureus in the pathogenesis of BP. S. aureus is aleading cause of skin and soft tissue infection and systemic disease. An estimated 30% of the generalpopulation is colonized with S. aureus leading to an increased risk of pathologic infection. Further S. aureushas been implicated in a host of inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases resulting from the local orsystemic effects of secreted virulence factors known as superantigens (SAg). Our central hypothesis is that S.aureus colonization plays an important role in pathogenesis BP. The rationale for the proposed research is thatestablishing a role for S. aureus in the pathogenesis of BP will immediately impact patient care through theaddition of antibiotic therapy to the first line of treatment for BP in order to reduce immunosuppressive burdenand improve patient outcomes. Guided by our robust preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested bypursuing two specific aims: 1) Establish the prevalence of S. aureus colonization and define SAg profiles ingeographically and demographically diverse BP patients. The studies in Aim 1 will determine the impact of raceor geographic location on the rate of S. aureus colonization in BP patients and controls matched by age sexand race through two enrollment sites in Iowa and Georgia. The rate of S. aureus colonization SAgexpression and protective antibody titers will be assessed in relation to measures of BP disease activity. Thestudies in Aim 2 will determine if S. aureus colonization promotes cutaneous autoimmunity by inducing skin-specific changes in cytokine profiles and V-TCR repertoire. These studies are relevant to the NIH's missionaimed at enhancing health lengthening life and reducing illness and relevant to Funding Opportunity PA-18-739 aimed at evaluating changes in microbiota and its influence in health and disease in the elderly includingthose of racial/ethnic minorities and understanding the underlying mechanisms of microbiota in aged subjectsas related to health and disease. This approach innovative because it represents a substantial departure fromthe current paradigms of BP pathogenesis. The proposed studies are significant because they will advanceand expand our understanding of the basic mechanisms of cutaneous autoimmunity in the elderly and will laythe groundwork for mechanistic studies geared toward understanding the role of S. aureus in the propagationof autoimmunity and generation of the initial autoantibody response in BP.","Abbreviations;Acute;Affect;Age;Age of Onset;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Antibody titer measurement;Area;Atopic Dermatitis;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune;Autoimmunity;Biopsy;Blood;Bulla;Bullous Pemphigoid;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Clinical Trials;Collagen Type XVII;Cutaneous;Data;Development;Disease;Disease remission;Doctor of Philosophy;Dose;Elderly;Enrollment;Enterotoxins;Environment;Exhibits;Flare;Forearm;Funding Opportunities;Gene Cluster;General Population;Generations;Geographic Locations;Geography;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Histocompatibility Antigens Class II;Hospitalization;Immune;Immunity;Immunosuppression;Incidence;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Investigation;Iowa;Knowledge;Lateral;Lesion;Letters;Life;Link;Liquid substance;Location;Measures;Medical History;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Play;Pneumonia;Population;Prevalence;Production;Race;Research;Respiratory System;Risk;Role;Sampling;Sepsis;Severity of illness;Site;Skin;Skin Tissue;Soft Tissue Infections;Staphylococcus aureus;Superantigens;Systemic disease;Systemic infection;T Chain;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Receptor;T-cell receptor repertoire;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic immunosuppression;Toxic Shock Syndrome;Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1;Toxin;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Virulence Factors;aged;aging population;clinical remission;commensal bacteria;cost effective;cytokine;efficacy evaluation;ethnic minority population;improved;improved outcome;innovation;microbiota;mortality;novel;pathogenic bacteria;pathogenic virus;peripheral blood;racial and ethnic;response;sex;skin disorder;standard care;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;therapy outcome","Modulation of Cutaneous Autoimmunity by Staphylococcus Aureus","NARRATIVEThe proposed studies will establish a role for staphylococcus aureus colonization in Bullous pemphigoid.

"Nutrition; Obesity","PROJECT SUMMARY Control of metabolic flux through the TCA cycle has been investigated dating back manydecades. However there are issues that still require clarification. One important but largelyneglected issue regards the role of oxaloacetate (OAA) inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase(SDH) in regulating mitochondrial function. Recent findings in my laboratory focused on skeletalmuscle mitochondria show that while low membrane potential () drives respiration low also initiates a sequence of events leading to mitochondrial OAA accumulation inhibition ofSDH and consequent inhibition or metabolic braking of respiration. Given that low appears to be the initiating factor the current proposal is focused on the role of OAA inregulating respiration in brown adipose tissue (BAT) wherein  is intrinsically low due to theaction of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Our overall hypothesis is that mitochondrial OAA metabolism and inhibition of SDH isregulated by definable interactions between UCP1 controlled  and downstream events andthat there are physiological consequences. Our aims address three issues. Aim 1 will delineatemolecular events initiated by UCP1-regulated  and culminating in OAA inhibition of O2 flux.Aim 2 examines UCP1 perturbations in live mice to determine if this translates to OAA effectson mitochondrial and cellular function. Aim 3 attempts to modulate OAA inhibition of SDH in away that may prove beneficial towards mitochondrial cellular and whole-body metabolism. To accomplish our objectives we will use a novel NMR assay to assess mitochondrialOAA content as well as other metabolites. A major reason why our knowledge of OAA effectson respiration is lacking is that OAA is difficult to assay since the metabolite is not stable. In factmetabolomics services whether commercial or in university cores do not offer quantification ofOAA. Our research will also use a novel adaptation of existing technology that we developed toassess mitochondrial respiration at clamped concentrations of ADP. In this way we can assessmitochodnrial respiration beyond the often-determined state 3 and state 4 which are notphysiological states. Finally we will use up-to-date mass spectroscopy methods for targetedmetabolite expression and for [13C]isotopomer tracer studies directed at metabolic flux. Our project is applicable to the clinical issue of obesity and its complications sinceunderstanding BAT physiology and how it is regulated will add to our overall knowledge ofwhole-body energetics.","Address;Adipocytes;Affect;Back;Biological Assay;Body fat;Brown Fat;Cell Respiration;Cell physiology;Cells;Citric Acid Cycle;Clinical;Closure by clamp;Diet;Dietary Intervention;Disease;Event;Goals;Heart;Hormonal;Human;Investigation;Knock-out;Knowledge;Laboratories;Learning;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Membrane Potentials;Metabolic;Metabolic Control;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;Methods;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Aspartate Aminotransferase;Molecular;Mouse Strains;Mus;Muscle Mitochondria;Nutrient;Obesity;Outcome;Oxalacetic Acid;Oxaloacetates;Pharmacology;Physiological;Physiology;Process;Production;Proteins;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Respiration;Rodent;Role;Services;Skeletal Muscle;Succinate Dehydrogenase;Technology;Tracer;Translating;Universities;Work;design;experimental study;improved;ketogenic diet;lipid metabolism;metabolomics;neglect;novel;overexpression;uncoupling protein 1","UCP1 and the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in brown adipose tissue by oxaloacetate","PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is designed to better understand the metabolic function of brown adiposetissue.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/AbstractIncreasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019 the Centerfor Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million peopleand are associated with at least 35900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularlyproblematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-lineantimicrobials have emerged globally while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled.To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens it is essential to guide clinicians away fromchoosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram a facility-level summary ofantimicrobial susceptibility data is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empirictherapy. However antibiograms have major limitations. First little is known about how clinicians are currentlyusing them when making empiric therapy decision. Second antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-leveland data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly but most importantly anantibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore there are strong and pressing needs tounderstand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk ofAMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapyand reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel real-time personalized antibiogram (SmartAntibiogram) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapyfor GNRs by providing a predicted risk of AMR based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- andfacility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informaticscoursework (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops and (d)a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinicalpractice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions forGram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assessthe accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a largeretrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict theindividualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally.This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (Smart Antibiogram). Theexpected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectivenessand limitations of antibiogram and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08Award the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR andhealth informatics with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system."," ","Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram","Project NarrativeAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public healththreats in the United States and globally.

"Genetics; Neurodegenerative","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTIn recent years there has emerged a striking realization that liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleicacids is responsible for the formation of various intracellular membraneless organelles. Examples of organellesformed by phase separation are nucleoli and Cajal bodies in the nucleus and stress granules and P granules inthe cytoplasm. The phase separation of protein-RNA composites in particular is being appreciated for crucialroles of connecting gene regulatory processes with the phenotypic complexity of eukaryotes. Despite the appar-ent biological signicance and extensive experimental efforts our understanding of the mechanisms which linkprotein-RNA phase separation with the transcriptional and catalytic processes is still lacking. The fundamentalchallenges stem from (i) The molecular heterogeneity and conformational exibility of RNA and proteins whichcontain low complexity disordered regions (ii) The juxtaposition of molecular and cellular scales (iii) Presence ofnon-equilibrium effects due to biochemical reactions ATP driven processes and irreversible bio-polymer uxes.The current theoretical and computational paradigms often lack optimal spatio-temporal resolution and the rightcombination of physical insights for confronting the complex experimental data in a comprehensive and integrativemanner. Here I propose using multi-scale computational tools developed in our lab combined in conjunction withdata-driven approaches for revealing general mechanistic principles of protein-RNA phase separation and its linkwith the functional regulatory processes. The proposal consists of three directions. In the rst direction we focuson hierarchical coarse-graining of proteins and RNA for studying thermodynamic driving forces of liquid-liquidphase separation in in vitro via molecular dynamics techniques. In the second direction we employ nite-elementand reaction-diffusion simulations trained by molecular models and experimental data for studying the connec-tion of liquid-liquid phase separation with transcriptional and catalytic reactions which is characteristic of in vivoconditions. In the third direction we assess the impact of protein-RNA phase separation generic gene regulatorynetworks by using stochastic dynamics simulations. The specic systems chosen for the study are experimen-tally well-characterized RNA binding proteins FUS TDP-43 Tau hnrpa1 and hnrpa2. These systems are knownfor forming liquid protein-RNA condensates under usually regulated conditions and aggregated structures whenmisregulated thereby leading to major neurodegenerative diseases. The completion of the proposed research program will elucidate the nature of the protein-RNA phase sepa-ration its link with functional biochemical reactions and provide much-needed insights for developing interventionstrategies for halting protein aggregation into diseases inducing cellular bodies.","Biochemical Reaction;Biological;Cell Nucleus;Characteristics;Complex;Cytoplasm;Cytoplasmic Granules;Data;Diffusion;Disease;Elements;Eukaryota;Genetic Transcription;Grain;Heterogeneity;In Vitro;Intervention;Investigation;Lead;Link;Liquid substance;Mental disorders;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Nature;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Nucleic Acids;Organelles;Phase;Phenotype;Polymers;Prevention strategy;Process;Proteins;RNA;RNA-Binding Protein FUS;Reaction;Regulator Genes;Research;Resolution;Role;Source;Structure;System;Techniques;Thermodynamics;Training;combat;computerized tools;driving force;flexibility;in vivo;insight;link protein;molecular dynamics;molecular modeling;novel;programs;protein TDP-43;protein aggregation;simulation;spatiotemporal;stem;stress granule;tau Proteins;theories","Multi-scale computational investigation of functions and mechanisms of protein-RNA phase separation.","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research will reveal general mechanistic principles of protein-RNA liquid-liquid phase separationthe misregulation of which is known to be a signicant source of neurodegenerative diseases.

Her long-term career goal is to become anindependent investigator and national leader conducting patient-centered interdisciplinary clinical research tooptimize mealtime care and patient outcomes across a broad range of care settings. Dr. Lius three traininggoals are: 1) Behavioral intervention science to develop knowledge and skills on the development deliveryevaluation and refinement of behavioral interventions for dementia mealtime care in clinical care settings; 2)Advanced methodologies in clinical trials to develop knowledge and skills in a) design and conduct of clinicaltrials and b) the use of qualitative and mixed methods to inform feasibility of the intervention and guiderefinement of the intervention; and 3) Advanced quantitative statistical methods to analyze large clustereddata coded from video-taped mealtime observations that are collected from behavioral clinical trials. Under thementorship of an accomplished team of investigators Dr. Liu will achieve the training goals through completionof systematically planned formal and informal training activities at the University of Iowa a research-intensiveorganization with significant and long-standing resources for early career investigators. The training plan willprovide her with knowledge and skills necessary to address two significant and intertwined dementia mealtimecare problems - mealtime difficulties and insufficient intake - both requiring immediate and joint resolution.Emerging evidence supports the negative association of full assistance provision and the positive associationof person-centered care with resident mealtime difficulties and intake. Current interventions on the use ofperson-centered care is lacking and fail to address care providers needs for knowledge and skills to provideoptimal mealtime care. To address this gap the proposed research aims to complete the development andfeasibility testing of a theory-based person-centered mealtime care intervention Optimizing Mealtime Care(OPTIMAL) to effectively engage residents in eating and maintain their highest level of function possible. Thethree specific aims are: 1) Develop the OPTIMAL intervention and training materials; 2) Determine thefeasibility of successfully delivering the OPTIMAL intervention; and 3) Determine the treatment fidelityof delivering OPTIMAL. This study will use a mixed methods approach integrating qualitative interviews and aone-group pre-post design. Data from this study will be used to refine the OPTIMAL intervention trainingmaterials and study procedures all of which will be used in future larger trials.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Contraception/Reproduction; Diabetes; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Maternal Health; Maternal Morbidity and Mortality; Physical Activity; Pregnancy; Prevention; Sleep Research; Women's Health","ABSTRACTAdverse pregnancy outcomes including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia affect 10-20% of pregnantwomen and are major risk factors for future maternal cardiovascular disease (CVD). Though moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) during pregnancy can reduce these risks less than 25% of pregnantwomen meet MVPA guidelines. Identification of additional modifiable behaviors that could reduce maternalhealth risks during pregnancy is needed to inform clinical interventions and practice. Remarkably little is knownabout the role of sedentary behavior or sleep in adverse pregnancy outcomes that increase future CVD risk. Thisis a critical research gap because sedentary behavior and sleep are increasingly recognized as CVD risk factorsin the general population independent of MVPA. Unfortunately existing studies in pregnancy largely focus onMVPA rather than the emerging paradigm that considers the full 24-hour behavioral cycle (i.e. sedentarybehavior sleep light-intensity physical activity and MVPA) lack repeated measures use suboptimalassessment methods and fail to measure clinically relevant outcomes. Clarifying how sedentary behavior andsleep influence pregnancy outcomes could inform intervention targets and guidelines to improve cardiovascularhealth during and after pregnancy. The overall goal of the proposed study is to examine the associations ofsedentary behavior (Aim 1) and sleep (Aim 2) with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adversepregnancy outcomes that increase future CVD risk. Novel statistical methods will be used to determine optimal24-hour behavioral patterns (Aim 3) during pregnancy for cardiovascular health. For this 500 women in earlypregnancy will be recruited to take part in a multi-site (Universities of Iowa and Pittsburgh) cohort study. Womenwill wear three state-of-the-art devices for seven days in each trimester of pregnancy to assess sedentarybehavior (activPAL micro 3) sleep (ActiWatch Spectrum Plus) and physical activity (ActiGraph GT3X).Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and other adverse outcomes will be obtained through medical chartabstraction. We hypothesize that women with a high sedentary behavior pattern short sleep duration patternand poor sleep quality pattern across trimesters will be more likely to have hypertensive disorders of pregnancy(primary) gestational diabetes preterm birth small-for-gestational age infants high blood pressure and poorglycemic control (secondary). Further we hypothesize that statistically reallocating time spent in sedentarybehavior for physical activity (LPA or MVPA) but not sleep (among adequate or high duration sleepers) will beassociated with lower incidence of these adverse outcomes. In direct response to the NHLBI Research Priority3.CC.04 this project will use advanced methods and models to assess and characterize the 24-hour behavioralcycle during pregnancy to better understand differences in health. This project will inform guidelines on optimal24-hour behavioral patterns in pregnancy as well as lay the foundation for future studies testing behavioralinterventions in pregnancy to achieve optimal outcomes and improve womens long-term cardiovascular health.","Adverse event;Affect;American Heart Association;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavior assessment;Behavioral;Biological;Blood Pressure;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Devices;Diabetes Mellitus;Event;Failure;Foundations;Future;General Population;Gestational Diabetes;Goals;Growth;Guidelines;Health;Hour;Hypertension;Incidence;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Iowa;Link;Maternal Health;Measures;Medical;Metabolic;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Mothers;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;Obesity;Outcome;Patient Self-Report;Pattern;Physical activity;Pilot Projects;Pre-Eclampsia;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Outcome;Pregnancy Trimesters;Pregnant Women;Premature Birth;Prevalence;Public Health;Research;Research Priority;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Site;Sleep;Small for Gestational Age Infant;Statistical Methods;Subgroup;Time;Universities;Woman;actigraphy;adverse outcome;adverse pregnancy outcome;behavior test;cardiometabolic risk;cardiovascular disorder risk;cardiovascular health;cardiovascular risk factor;clinically relevant;demographics;early pregnancy;glycemic control;health difference;improved;light intensity;modifiable behavior;mortality;novel;poor sleep;pregnancy disorder;pregnancy hypertension;primary outcome;recruit;response;secondary outcome;sedentary;sedentary lifestyle;sleep pattern;sleep quality;success;therapy design;vigorous intensity","Sedentary behavior physical activity sleep and cardiovascular risk in pregnancy: the Pregnancy 24/7 cohort study","PROJECT NARRATIVEModerate to vigorous intensity physical activity is known to reduce the risk of hypertensive disorders ofpregnancy and other adverse pregnancy outcomes that increase future maternal cardiovascular disease riskyet less than 25% of pregnant women meet public health activity guidelines.

As an example of degenerative TMD the risk for post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA)after serious joint injuries has not improved substantially in the last 40 years despite many refinements in care.This underscores the urgent need for new treatments to prevent PTOA initiated by joint damage. Fibrocartilageis notoriously limited in its intrinsic capacity for repair focal damage associated with joint injuries seldom healsand often worsens to engulf entire articular surfaces. Cell-based therapies intended to regenerate neocartilagein situ have shown some clinical promise. The two most common microfracture and autologous chondrocyteimplantation (ACI) work well in the short term; however long term results have been disappointing. Thepresence of chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) in the TMJ fibrocartilage suggests that a rudimentary self-repair mechanism exists that might be marshaled for fibrocartilage regeneration after traumatic injury. CPCrecruitment can be enhanced by exosomes derived from bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC-Exos) which servean important role in intercellular communication and tissue repair. Our central hypothesis is that BMSC-Exos will stimulate TMJ condylar fibrocartilage repair by promotingCPC chemotaxis and chondrogenesis intended for the treatment of focal lesions in TMJ fibrocartilage. The mainappeal of a CPC-based repair strategy lies in their ability to heal by self-congregating at injury sites without exvivo cell expansion and the additional surgery needed for grafting in ACI. Specific aims in this proposed studyare to characterize BMSC-Exos and determine the effects of BMSC-Exos on CPC migration and fibrocartilagedifferentiation in vitro. Finally in vivo fibrocartilage repair will be evaluated in a rabbit TMJ disc perforation modelwhere direct fibrocartilage contact between the condyle and mandibular fossa will induce degenerativefibrocartilage. BMSC-Exos encapsulated in hydrogel (F-127/hyaluronic acid) will be injected to the damagedTMJs 2 weeks after the perforation surgeries. Six weeks after the injection integrity of the repaired fibrocartilagewill be determined by histological/immunohistochemical staining and evaluated based on a modified OARSIscoring system. At the conclusion of this project we will be able to define the therapeutic potential of BMSC-Exos for fibrocartilage repair and to identify miRNAs that may regulate cell migration and neotissue formation. As our future research plans we will validate the candidate key miRNAs and synthesize target microRNA(miRNAs) for CPC migration and neofibrocartilage formation. The target miRNAs will be loaded in engineeredexosomes for in vivo delivery thereby replacing BMSC culture as a means of exosome production. This willfurther enhance the translatability of the minimally-invasive single-step delivery procedure for cartilageregeneration described in this proposal.","3-Dimensional;Applications Grants;Arthralgia;Arthroscopy;Attention;Autologous;Bilateral;Biological Assay;Bone Marrow;Caring;Cell Communication;Cell Lineage;Cell Therapy;Cells;Characteristics;Chemotactic Factors;Chemotaxis;Chondrocytes;Chondrogenesis;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Data;Degenerative Disorder;Degenerative polyarthritis;Diagnosis;Disease;Encapsulated;Fibrocartilages;Fossa;Functional disorder;Future;Goals;Histologic;Homing;Human;Hyaline Cartilage;Hyaluronic Acid;Hydrogels;In Situ;In Vitro;Injections;Injury;International;Intervention;Joints;Knowledge;Lead;Left;Lesion;Long-Term Effects;Mandible;Marshal;Masticatory muscles;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Morphology;Natural regeneration;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;Pain;Patients;Perforation;Play;Postoperative Period;Procedures;Production;Proliferating;Prunella vulgaris;Replacement Arthroplasty;Research;Role;Signs and Symptoms;Site;Societies;Stains;Stromal Cells;Structure of articular disc of temporomandibular joint;Surface;Symptoms;System;Temporomandibular Joint;Temporomandibular Joint Disorders;Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;Traumatic injury;United States;Work;arthropathies;base;cartilage regeneration;cartilage repair;cell motility;cost;design;disorder risk;engineered exosomes;exosome;healing;implantation;improved;in vivo;intercellular communication;joint injury;maxillofacial;miRNA expression profiling;minimally invasive;next generation sequencing;novel;novel strategies;prevent;protein biomarkers;recruit;regenerative;repair strategy;repaired;stem cells;tissue repair;treatment strategy;uptake","A Novel Strategy of Endogenous Progenitor Cell Homing Using Exosomes for Condylar Fibrocartilage Repair in Temporomandibular Joint","PROJECT NARRATIVE Degenerative temporomandibular joint (TMJ) fibrocartilage rarely heals spontaneously and may lead tothe syndrome of TMJ disorder (TMD) which is one of the most challenging oral and maxillofacial problems.

"Diabetes; Neurosciences; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTDiabetes is one of the leading causes of death affecting more than 30 million people in the U.S. with one in fourindividuals over 65 years suffering from its debilitating symptoms. Economically diabetes represents anenormous burden due to associated healthcare cost and loss of productivity. Insulin is the most effectivetreatment used by many diabetic patients. However achieving euglycemic balance can be a challenge sincetherapeutic insulin often leads to unintended sharp drop in blood glucose level causing severe hypoglycemiawhich if not addressed may result in coma and death. Frequent hypoglycemia is one of the most reliablepredictor of malignant disease course and mortality in diabetes. Normally hypoglycemia is averted bycounterregulary response pathway in the brain which coordinates a series of physiological measures along withhunger to restore blood glucose. However recurrent hypoglycemic episodes due to intensive insulin therapyand daily activities impairs these brain pathways leaving diabetic patients vulnerable to subsequenthypoglycemia. Efforts to identify the central counterregulatory pathways revealed essential role of brainstemcatecholamine neurons. We and others have shown that these neurons project extensively to hypothalamusand these projections are essential for their counterregulatory actions. However hypothalamic target(s) of theseneurons and the mechanism(s) underlying their impairment by repeated hypoglycemia has not been determined.The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the neural circuit(s) mediating counterregulatory actions ofbrainstem catecholamine neurons. The aims of this grant are to 1) determine the direct neuronal target(s) ofmedullary catecholamine neurons in the hypothalamus mediating counterregulation and 2) determine howrepeated hypoglycemic episodes desensitize communication in this pathway. To accomplish these aims we willuse axons of medullary catecholamine neurons as a map to downstream circuits. These studies will provide newfundamental insights into the central counterregulatory pathways. In addition by identifying mechanism ofimpaired counterregulation these studies may lead to novel therapeutic targets for the treatment ofhypoglycemia associated autonomic failure and hypoglycemia unawareness.","Ablation;Address;Adult;Affect;American;Axon;Blood Glucose;Brain;Brain Stem;Catecholamines;Cause of Death;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cessation of life;Clinical;Coma;Communication;Dangerousness;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Dorsal;Drops;Equilibrium;Failure;Fiber;Glucose;Goals;Grant;Health Care Costs;Hormonal;Hunger;Hypoglycemia;Hypothalamic structure;Impairment;Individual;Insulin;Intervention;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Malignant - descriptor;Maps;Measures;Medial;Mediating;Microglia;Molecular;Neurons;Norepinephrine;Outcome;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Photometry;Physiological;Recurrence;Research;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Risk;Role;Series;Signal Transduction;Therapeutic;behavioral response;blood glucose regulation;brain pathway;counterregulation;desensitization;diabetes management;diabetic patient;disabling symptom;effective therapy;feeding;glycemic control;hypoglycemia unawareness;improved;in vivo;insight;mortality;neural circuit;new therapeutic target;novel;optogenetics;paraventricular nucleus;prevent;productivity loss;real-time images;response;single-cell RNA sequencing","Targeting Ascending Catecholamine Pathways to Prevent Hypoglycemia","PROJECT NARRATIVEAccording to the CDC over 30 million Americans live with diabetes with more than a quarter of adults over 65years suffer from its debilitating sequela.

"Clinical Research; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention","Project SummaryWorldwide more than 1 in 10 babies born are premature (<37 weeks gestation) and the incidence is on therise. The recent increase in preterm (PT) births is the result of the rise in late preterm (LPT) birth (34 to 36weeks gestation) which constitute the largest and fastest growing portion of all PT births. Children with LPTare at significant risk to experience mathematical difficulties in school. Mathematical skills are paramount tolater life outcomes including adulthood health and wealth. Math success in school is rooted in numerical andspatial skills that develop during preschool years. However a significant knowledge gap exists on the origins ofLPTs math difficulties. The long-term goal for this application is to identify the mechanisms that underlieacademic difficulties in PT children. The overall objective for this application is to characterize the developmentof numerical and spatial skills (NS) among LPTs and to identify the key factors that explain individualdifferences in NS skills in LPTs and Term children during preschool years. The central hypothesis is that LPTswill exhibit specific difficulties in NS tasks compared to Term children controlling for general cognitiveperformance. Further prematurity and parental factors (parental language NS input) will interact in predictingindividual differences in NS skill in LPT and Term children. The rationale that underlies the proposed project isthat once NS development in LPTs is better understood evidence-based early identification and interventionmethods can be developed to support at-risk LPTs before math difficulties in school emerge. The centralhypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Compare the differences in NS skills of LPT andTerm children at age 4 to 5 years; and 2) Determine the relation between parental NS language input and NSskills of LPT and Term children at age 4 to 5 years. For the first aim childrens verbal and nonverbal NS skillswill be assessed using experimental and standardized measures. For the second aim parental language inputabout NS concepts (e.g. counting cardinality spatial terms) during a semi-naturalistic play interaction in thelab will be identified. The research proposed in this application is innovative in the applicants opinionbecause it departs from the status quo in research on PTs by focusing on late prematurity and preschoolyears combining experimental standardized and observational measures and examining the role ofexperiential factors that might serve as modifiable risk factors that stakeholders can target. The proposal issignificant because it will inform efforts targeting early NS difficulties and thereby maximize LPTs futurepotential. Ultimately such knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development ofinnovative and effective early prevention and interventions that leverage home support to prevent academicdifficulties in at-risk children.","37 weeks gestation;Adult;Age;Area;Birth Weight;Caring;Characteristics;Child;Child Support;Clinics and Hospitals;Collaborations;Data;Development;Early Intervention;Early identification;Elderly;Exhibits;Future;Gestational Age;Goals;Health;Home;Incidence;Individual Differences;Interdisciplinary Study;Intervention;Iowa;Knowledge;Language;Life;Mathematics;Measures;Medical;Methods;Mission;Neurocognitive;Nursery Schools;Outcome;PF4 Gene;Parents;Performance;Plant Roots;Play;Population;Pregnancy;Premature Birth;Premature Infant;Prevention;Productivity;Public Health;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Schools;Socioeconomic Status;Source;Special Education;Standardization;Testing;Toy;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Variant;aged;cognitive performance;cost;delivery complications;evidence base;experience;improved;innovation;literacy;mathematical difficulties;modifiable risk;neglect;peer;perinatal health;premature;prevent;preventive intervention;provider factors;recruit;skill acquisition;skills;standardize measure;success","Identifying Relationships between Late Premature Birth Parental Factors and Early Numerical and Spatial Development","Project NarrativeThe proposed project is relevant to public health because rates of late preterm birth (gestational age 34 to 36weeks) are increasing and children with late preterm birth are at significant risk for math difficulties predictiveof significant life outcomes.

"No NIH Category available","Our goal is to provide a physical and chemical rationale for how human caspase-7 (C7) is allostericallycontrolled particularly by small molecules. Caspase dysregulation both catalytic and autocatalytichas been implicated in numerous neurodegenerative inflammatory diseases and cancers. Due to ahighly charged active site with low druggability and selectivity problems development of active siteinhibitors has been problematic. However there has been enormous interest in targeting an allostericpocket of C7 which is located more than 17  from the active site. The current proposal includes datathat represents a breakthrough advance in our understanding of how small drug-like molecules maybe used to allosterically dial down the activity of C7. This initial groundwork has been made possibleby advances in Fragment Based Drug Discovery (FBDD) which includes a confluence of chemicalinformatics biophysical methods such as Surface Plasmon Resonance X-ray crystallography andmolecular dynamics. The work described in this proposal centers on our discovery of a series ofreversible allosteric inhibitors that bind in this allosteric pocket which are the first drug-like compoundsto show such activity in caspases. The allosteric effectors obtained from our FBDD campaign wereused to elucidate several high resolution crystal structures of the inhibited complex which revealed away forward for specific allosteric control for this enzyme. The use of FBDD as illustrated by our twoinhibited high resolution crystal structures PDB-ID 5V6U and 5V6Z provide us with the first rationalbasis for structure-activity relationships for reversible allosteric inhibitors for the executioner caspaseclass of drug targets. These two structures clearly show that binding of the allosteric inhibitor to theremote allosteric pocket of C7 yields structures with C7s catalytic thiolate (Cys186) oriented in a non-productive conformation (pointing into the P1 pocket instead of into the active site). Another importantfeature of these allosterically inhibited complexes is a large increase in crystallographic B-factors(relative to crystal structures of uninhibited C7) of a number of important loop regions. This proposalwill focus on obtaining high resolution structures of the many other distinct allosteric effectors resultingfrom our FBDD campaign which have not been co-crystallized with C7 including 13 confirmedinhibitors 5 binders that do not inhibit and one activator; completion of this work will provide astructural Rosetta Stone (an ability to directly compare inhibitor non-inhibitor and activator) forunderstanding how C7s catalytic power is affected by remote ligation at the allosteric pocket. Uponsuccessful completion not only will we learn what chemical space occupancy in the C7 allostericpocket results in inhibition but more importantly we will know how these remotely bound species areachieving their dampening of C7s catalytic power.","Active Sites;Acylation;Affect;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Binding;Biophysics;CASP7 gene;Caspase;Cells;Charge;Chemicals;Cleaved cell;Complex;Crystallization;Data;Deposition;Development;Disease;Drug Targeting;Enzyme Precursors;Enzymes;Family;Foundations;Goals;Human;Hydrolysis;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Kinetics;Knowledge;Learning;Ligation;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurable;Methods;Modeling;Molecular Conformation;Nerve Degeneration;Pathway interactions;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Positioning Attribute;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Property;Resolution;Role;Scheme;Series;Source;Specificity;Stimulus;Structural Models;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Surface Plasmon Resonance;System;Testing;Work;X-Ray Crystallography;base;biophysical techniques;cheminformatics;deacylation;drug discovery;flexibility;genetic regulatory protein;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;interest;molecular dynamics;novel;response;screening;simulation;small molecule","Dialing down caspase-7 through allosteric control: An integrated approach","Upon successful completion of the proposed project not only will we learn how caspase-7 isallosterically controlled both in its natural zymogenic context but also how small molecules boundvery far from the enzyme active site are able to tune the catalytic activity.

"Lung; Prevention; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYAlthough the ubiquity of metabolic problems in pulmonary hypertension (PH) has been known for more than adecade a wealth of new details on the nature of this problem presents the opportunity for intervention. Acombination of experimental work in cells and animals and early trials in humans suggests that thesemetabolic problems are part of the causation for PH and that inactivation of the mitochondrial lysinedeacetylase SIRT3 is a central node in regulating the metabolic defects. A vicious cycle exists in which atriggering event or mutation increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) which produces reactive lipids whichadduct and inactivate SIRT3 causing metabolic changes that result in further increased ROS. Here we breakthis cycle using 2-HOBA a small molecule which can effectively soak up reactive lipids in vivo and has positiveresults in safety trials for other indications in humans with some still ongoing. Effectiveness of 2-HOBA hasalready been established for the prevention of PH in mice and the mechanism suggests it should be effectivefor reversal. Here we prepare for human trials of 2-HOBA by testing its efficacy for reversal of establisheddisease in two molecularly accurate mouse models alone or in combination with metformin and by examiningserum biomarkers of disease shared between humans and mice for early indications of response which can beused to guide human trials.","Acetylation;Address;Affinity;Animal Model;Animals;BMPR2 gene;Binding;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Blood Vessels;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical Trials;Data;Deacetylase;Defect;Disease;Disease Progression;Doxycycline;EFRAC;Effectiveness;Etiology;Event;Failure;Genetic;Glucose;Glutamine;Heart;Heart failure;Heritability;Human;Hypoxia;Incidence;Insulin;Intervention;Life;Lipids;Literature;Lung;Lysine;Measurable;Metabolic;Metabolic Marker;Metabolism;Metformin;Methods;Mitochondria;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Nature;Oxygen;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phenotype;Physiological;Prevention;Process;Proteins;Publishing;Pulmonary Hypertension;Pulmonary Vascular Resistance;Pulmonary vessels;Rare Diseases;Reactive Oxygen Species;SOD2 gene;Safety;Sampling;Serum;Testing;Time;Vasodilator Agents;Work;adduct;blood vessel occlusion;circulating biomarkers;disease-causing mutation;early detection biomarkers;efficacy testing;fatty acid oxidation;human disease;in vivo;innovation;molecular phenotype;mouse model;mutant;overexpression;preservation;primary pulmonary hypertension;response;safety testing;small molecule;success;uptake","2-HOBA for Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension","NARRATIVEThe literature and our preliminary data support the hypothesis that the metabolic defects that are required forprogression of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) are caused in part of by inactivation of key proteins by adductionof reactive lipids.

"Autoimmune Disease; Biotechnology; Cancer; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Stomach Cancer; Women's Health","SUMMARY:Many cancers are recognized to have an inflammatory etiology. Gastric cancer the third leading cause of cancerdeaths worldwide is the prototype- it is caused by infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori in90% of cases. For colorectal cancer (CRC) the second leading cause of cancer deaths inflammatory boweldisease (IBD) is a frequent precursor lesion. This STTR Phase I proposal is a partnership between the WilsonLab at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) which is focused on gastrointestinal inflammation-associated carcinogenesis and MTI BioTech Inc. (MTI) who are together developing a new therapeutic strategyto prevent cancer. Under conditions of chronic mucosal inflammation increased enzyme activities result information of dicarbonyl electrophiles products of lipid peroxidation that include isolevuglandins (isoLGs)malondialdehyde 4-oxo-nonenal and acrolein all of which can form adducts with DNA histones and proteins.This adduct formation may lead to somatic genomic abnormalities and risk for neoplastic transformation. Thecompound 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) can serve as a scavenger of all electrophiles thus preventingadduct formation. 2-HOBA is a natural product derived from buckwheat seeds. It has been shown to be highlybioavailable with no toxicity in rodents and in recent human Phase I clinical trials. 2-HOBA protects mice fromoxidative damage in models of hypertension and Alzheimers disease. The Wilson Lab has discovered that isoLGadducts are increased i) in gastric tissues of patients and mice infected with H. pylori; ii) in the colon of humanswith chronic colitis from inflammatory bowel disease and colitis-associated cancer (CAC) and mice treated withazoxymethane-dextran sulfate sodium (AOM-DSS) a model of CAC. The Lab has found that a 2-HOBA analogEtHOBA which also scavenges electrophiles markedly reduces gastric dysplasia and carcinoma in two modelsof H. pylori-induced gastric carcinoma transgenic FVB/N insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) mice and Mongolian gerbilsand reduces colonic tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS CAC model. However unlike 2-HOBA EtHOBA has notreached development for human use. We hypothesize that electrophiles have a key role in inflammation-drivengastrointestinal carcinogenesis via formation of adducts to macromolecules and are new molecular targets forcancer prevention by 2-HOBA. We will determine the protective effect of 2-HOBA on H. pylori-induced gastriccarcinogenesis in INS-GAS mice and gerbils (Aim 1) and on colitis-associated carcinogenesis in the AOM-DSSmouse model (Aim 2). Primary endpoints will be reduction in dysplasia carcinoma and tumor formation andsecondary endpoints will be effects on DNA damage and isoLG adducts. A successful STTR Phase I outcomewill be a protective effect of 2-HOBA on gastric and colon carcinogenesis and will be the primary go/no goendpoint to a Phase II STTR project. We envision future studies testing 2-HOBA in animals in which disease isalready fully established; further assessment of molecular mechanisms underlying protective effects includingin human organoids; and human clinical trials in patients with precancerous gastric and colon lesions.","Academic Medical Centers;Acrolein;Aldehydes;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amines;Animal Experiments;Animal Model;Animals;Automobile Driving;Azoxymethane;Bacterial Infections;Bioavailable;Biological Availability;Biotechnology;Buckwheat;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Carcinoma;Cells;Cessation of life;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Colitis;Collaborations;Colon;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Neoplasms;Colorectal Cancer;DNA;DNA Damage;Data;Development;Disease;Dysplasia;Enzymes;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Etiology;Future;Gastric Intraepithelial Neoplasia;Gastric Tissue;Gastrins;Gastritis;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Genes;Genomics;Gerbils;Helicobacter Infections;Helicobacter pylori;Histologic;Histones;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Hypertension;Immune;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Insulin;Lead;Lesion;Lipid Peroxidation;Lymphoma cell;Lysine;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Malondialdehyde;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Mucositis;Mus;N-methylacetamide-oxotremorine M;NADPH Oxidase;Natural Products;Neoplastic Cell Transformation;Nucleic Acids;Organoids;Outcome;Oxides;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Phase I Clinical Trials;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids;Prevention;Process;Prostaglandins;Proteins;Publishing;Risk;Rodent;Rodent Model;Role;Safety;Seeds;Small Business Technology Transfer Research;Sodium Dextran Sulfate;Stomach;Stomach Carcinoma;Testing;Therapeutic;Toxic effect;Transgenic Organisms;adduct;analog;base;cancer prevention;cancer risk;carcinogenesis;colitis associated cancer;colon carcinogenesis;crosslink;cyclooxygenase 2;enzyme activity;gastric carcinogenesis;gastrointestinal;high risk;lifetime risk;macromolecule;malignant stomach neoplasm;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;oxidative damage;pathogenic bacteria;phase 2 study;polyamine oxidase;pre-clinical;premalignant;prevent;primary endpoint;protective effect;prototype;secondary endpoint;tumor;tumorigenesis","Efficacy of an Electrophile Scavenger in the Prevention of Gastrointestinal Inflammatory Carcinogenesis","NARRATIVE:Many human cancers are caused by chronic inflammation and this is especially true in the gastrointestinal tractwhere most cases of stomach cancer are caused by a bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori and colorectalcancer is often caused by inflammatory bowel disease due to colitis-associated carcinogenesis.

"Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease","PROJECT SUMMARYJunctophilin 2 (JP2) is an essential structural protein required for the formation of junctional couplings (i.e.cardiac dyads) between the transverse (T)-tubule membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). JP2 functionis therefore fundamental for the local control of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and efficient contraction in ventricularmyocytes during cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. JP2 protein levels progressively decline in failinghuman hearts and in animal models of heart failure leading to T-tubule remodeling and loss of E-C couplingfunction. The downregulation of JP2 at E-C coupling sites is in part due to specific cleavage by the Ca2+-activatedprotease calpain that is implicated in a variety of heart diseases. During the previous funding period wedemonstrated that stress- and calpain-dependent cleavage of JP2 liberates a novel nuclear translocating N-terminal fragment (JP2NT) that represses maladaptive transcriptional reprogramming in diseased hearts thustransducing E-C uncoupling information into a unique cardio-protective excitation-transcription (E-T) couplingsignal to the nucleus. However how JP2-mediated E-C and E-T coupling phenomena are mechanistically regulatedremains to be determined. Our new preliminary results show that JP2 is reproducibly phosphorylated in stressedhearts near regions responsible for JP2 cleavage and the subcellular localization of JP2NT. In this competitiverenewal application we aim to define how stress-induced post-translational modifications regulate the structurelocalization and function of JP2/JP2NT. We hypothesize that JP2NT-mediated E-T coupling is tightly regulatedby cardiac stress-dependent phosphorylation of JP2 that determines JP2 sensitivity to calpain and JP2NTnuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. To test our hypothesis in Aim 1 we will use mutation analysisand cell models to determine how JP2 phosphorylation regulates E-C coupling and cleavage-induced JP2NTgeneration nuclear translocation and transcriptional regulation. In Aim 2 we will utilize our novel JP2 calpainresistant mice in combination with JP2NT overexpression to determine how these targeted approaches modulatecardiac responses to stress in vivo. We will determine how E-C coupling structure/function and cardiac genetranscription are altered in these mice in response to pressure overload and myocardial infarction. We expectour studies will provide significant insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing JP2/JP2NT function andtheir salutary contribution toward heart disease pathogenesis.","Animal Model;Attenuated;Biochemical;Calpain;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Nucleus;Cell membrane;Cell model;Complex;Coupling;Data;Development;Disease;Down-Regulation;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart failure;Homeostasis;Human;Knock-in Mouse;Link;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Membrane;Modification;Molecular;Mus;Muscle Cells;Mutate;Mutation;Mutation Analysis;Myocardial Infarction;N-terminal;Nuclear;Nuclear Import;Nuclear Translocation;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Physiology;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Prevalence;Process;Production;Proteins;Proteolysis;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Role;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Stress;Structural Protein;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Transcript;Transcriptional Regulation;Translations;Treatment Failure;Tubular formation;Ventricular;base;biological adaptation to stress;cardioprotection;cardiovascular health;design;experimental study;heart function;heart preservation;improved;in vitro Assay;in vivo;insight;junctophilin;mimetics;multidisciplinary;mutant;novel;overexpression;preservation;pressure;prevent;response;tool;transcriptional reprogramming","Novel Functions of the E-C Coupling Structural Protein Junctophilin-2 in the Heart","PROJECT NARRATIVECurrent treatments of heart failure continue to be insufficient for all patients.

Current clinical standard relies on histopathology that fail to accurately predict PD-L1 due tospatial and temporal heterogeneities among patients. Further screening patients for PD-L1 alone is notpredictive of treatment response due to significant variabilities in PD-L1 assays across labs necessitatingsimultaneous detection of multiple immunomarkers. This establishes our scientific premise that an urgentneed exists for accurate noninvasive diagnostic tools that enables detection of both PD-L1 and other markersinvolved in immune modulation directly in vivo. Whereas ImmunoPET (positron emission tomography) imaginghas transformed our ability to detect single immunomarkers in vivo multiplexing cannot be achieved with PETas signal between radionuclides cannot be distinguished. Without the ability to multiplex patients wouldundergo multiple radiotracer dosing and repeated radiation exposure. Further dynamic changes inimmunomarkers during treatment would be missed as sequential dosing of different radiotracers would require>1 week wait time between doses to allow for decay of the radiotracers. Our objective is to address thelimitations of current approaches and enable multiplexed detection of both PD-L1 and CD8+ T cells in vivo withan innovative nanoprobe immunoactive gold nanoparticles (IGNs). IGNs labeled with antibodies Ramanreporters and 89Zr radiotracers synergistically integrates the merits of immunoPET with surface-enhancedRaman spectroscopy (SERS). SERS an optical technique uses near-infrared light to enhance the vibrationalsignal of Raman reporters enabling narrow spectral features amenable for multiplexing. Our approach isunique because clinically-translatable IGNs seamlessly combine the depth-resolved whole body imaging ofPET with the high resolution and multiplexing ability of SERS enabling simultaneous detection of bothimmunomarkers in vivo with high specificity. Detection of both immunomarkers in vivo is important becausedynamic changes occur in both PD-L1 and CD8 during and after treatment that are not captured by staticmeasure of receptors or by single biomarker imaging. Whereas immunomarker detection with IGNs is relevantto many diseases we will use mouse models of breast cancer (BC) since PD-L1 and CD8 immunomarkersplay a critical role in BC treatment response. IGNs will detect both PD-L1 and CD8 in orthotopic BC mousemodels (Aim 1) monitor response to immunotherapies (Aim 2) and validate in clinically-relevant humanizedmice (Aim 3). IGNs is a generalizable platform and ultimately our strategy can be mapped onto other diseasesincluding infection and autoimmunity where PD-L1 and CD8 biomarkers also play a key role. Further IGNscan also be targeted to a number of other biomarkers via antibodies facilitating treatment response in multipledisorders with unprecedented accuracy not achievable with current clinicopathological approaches.","Address;Aftercare;Alternative Therapies;Antibodies;Autoimmunity;Beta Cell;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Treatment;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cell physiology;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Detection;Disease;Disease model;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Heterogeneity;Histopathology;Human;ImmunoPET;Immunocompetent;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapy;Infection;Infiltration;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Internal Breast Prosthesis;Label;Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex;Ligands;Light;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Measures;Methods;Monitor;Monoclonal Antibodies;Multimodal Imaging;Mus;Optics;Outcome;PD-L1 blockade;Patients;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Play;Positron-Emission Tomography;Radiation exposure;Radiochemistry;Radioimmunoconjugate;Radioisotopes;Radiolabeled;Raman Spectrum Analysis;Regimen;Reporter;Resolution;Retrieval;Role;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Surface;T-Lymphocyte;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tissues;Treatment Protocols;Up-Regulation;Wait Time;alternative treatment;anti-PD-L1;anti-PD-L1 therapy;bioimaging;clinically relevant;clinically translatable;humanized mouse;imaging biomarker;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;in vivo imaging;in vivo monitoring;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;interest;intraperitoneal;islet;longitudinal positron emission tomography;malignant breast neoplasm;mouse model;multidisciplinary;multimodality;multiplex detection;nanoGold;nanoparticle;nanoprobe;noninvasive diagnosis;novel;orthotopic breast cancer;patient screening;patient subsets;pre-clinical;predicting response;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;radiotracer;receptor;response;screening;spatiotemporal;spectroscopic imaging;therapy outcome;tool;translational study;treatment response;tumor;tumor-immune system interactions;vibration;whole body imaging","Developing Multimodal Multiplexed ImmunoPET-Raman Probes to Guide Immunotherapies","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis impactful proposal will enable multiplexed detection of both PD-L1 and CD8 immunomarkerssimultaneously in vivo and monitor response to immunotherapies through a cutting-edge multimodalnanoprobe immunoactive gold nanoparticles (IGNs).

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Neuroblastoma; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases","Melanoma incidence in the United States is growing rapidly. Surgery combined with radiation can be curative atearly stages but metastatic melanoma is usually fatal. Since 2011 targeted MAPKi and immunotherapies haveimproved outcomes but low response rates acquired resistance and adverse events limit quality of life for thesepatients (5-yr. survival <25%). Under predicate R&D Viewpoint (VMT) demonstrated the potential of peptide-receptor-targeted alpha(a)-particle ([212Pb]VMT01) therapy (PRRT) targeting the melanocortin subtype 1 receptor (MC1R);alone and in combination with FDA-approved drugs. VMT01 innovations include our biorthogonal clickcyclization; Pb-specific chelator (PSC) that enhances 203Pb/212Pb radiometal coupling; and linker-chemistry thatimproves VMT01 internalization on receptor binding. The commercial potential of PRRT is evidenced by the recentFDA approval of beta(b)-particle PRRT for neuroendocrine tumors (Lutathera). While objective responses wereseen in only 18% of patients in the Phase 3 trial Lutathera developer (AAA) was acquired by Novartis for $3.9Bln.Alpha(a)-particle therapy is an exciting-emerging form of PRRT that is producing objective (and even complete)responses clinically. Viewpoint secured financing to support a Phase 1 [203Pb]VMT01 human imaging/dosimetrytrial according to FDA guidance (begins May 2020; Mayo Clinic) prior to therapy trials of [212Pb]VMT01. ThisDirect to Phase II research is significant because VMTs a-therapies have the potential to improve outcomesfor thousands of metastatic melanoma neuroendocrine tumor patients for whom all therapies fall short.PREDICATE MILESTONES: Secured $650k investment; a Phase II SBIR (CA203430) to conduct an[203Pb]VMT01 imaging/dosimetry trial (Mayo Clinic); an NIH R01 with the University of Iowa to (CA243014;Viewpoint CSO Schultz is Co-PI) to conduct a Phase 1 a-therapy trial (VMT-a-NET) for neuroendocrine tumors;automated radiopharmaceutical production (GMP kits); exclusively licensed IP; 203Pb supply agreement withLantheus; established radiopharmacy operations; completed working prototype of 212Pb production device (VMT-a-GEN) and established manufacturing facilities.

Manufacture & validate GMP VMT01 peptide and conduct pharmacology/toxicology in non-humanprimates in parallel with funded Phase 1 imaging trial.AIM 2. Scale and validate manufacturing of 224Ra/212Pb production device (VMT-a-GEN) for clinical trials.IMPACT: With success we expect to have obtained validated GMP grade VMT01 peptide and thepharmacology/toxicology data needed for CMC/IND submission/approval for VMT01 therapy trials. We furtherexpect to have scaled VMT-a-GEN manufacturing to meet the need of 1 generator per week for our funded VMT-a-NET for neuroendocrine tumors trial and yet to be funded VMT01 for metastatic melanoma therapy trial.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Pediatric","Abstract: The US has many more health science STEM jobs available than qualified workers to do them. Wealso lag other OECD nations in math and science skills. Better STEM education is needed that engagesprepares and inspires K-12 studentsespecially under-represented groups. 21st Century STEM jobs requiresolid STEM content knowledge along with problem-solving/critical thinking skills and teamwork. Collaborativegame-based bioengineering learning experiences have the potential to meet these STEM-related needs and toprepare more people of all types for health science jobs. However innovations are required to boostimplementation reduce cost and enhance authenticity/realism and K-12 student engagement. A key aspect ofour STEM deficit is our failure to give students foundational math/science skills and to convey their real-worldrelevance. Project-based learning (PBL) and engineering in K-12 can achieve this but is currently limited byinstructional time teacher training project resource costs and difficulty in evaluating engaging project-basedexperiences. Research shows that team STEM collaboration and application to community problems improveSTEM outcomesespecially for under-represented groups. Yet access to programs and experiences that meldthese two features with instruction is limited; common PBL lacks sufficient realism for upper-level high schoollearning; and innovative cost-effective solutions that are self-paced easy to implement and that supportcollaboration are not yet available. In response to these needs this multi-phase SBIR project will capitalize onstrong preliminary work/data to develop validate and commercialize a game-based bioengineering tool calledMimetics and Medically Inspired Classroom Engineering (MiMCRE). As envisioned it will employ applied mathand science in the design analysis and simulation of bioengineering- and biomimicry-focused projects. Studentswill collaboratively design prosthetics apply math and science models to evaluate them and then 3D-print andtest outcomes in the real world. MiMICRE will be sold into high school post-secondary and informal Ed. markets.Our STEM application team will work with bioengineering diversity and evaluation consultants and engineeringsoftware industry partners to pursue three proof-of-concept Phase I Aims: 1) Show the feasibility of integratingcommercial tools for CAD and computational analysis with a game-based bioengineering environment for STEM;2) Show the functionality of a biomedical engineering project in MiMICRE to engage teams of students supportprototyping and connect to NGSS and CCSS math standards; and 3) Test MiMICRE with students. Success inverifying usability via a System Usability Score feasibility of implementation by completing challenges duringtypical class sessions and time support for effective collaboration using group interaction and digital design-sharing and improved outcomes with statistically significant knowledge increases will set the stage for a largerPhase II demonstrationduring which we will add to the diversity of biomimetic/bioengineering projects addsupport for post-secondary applications refine the prototype and conduct more-rigorous MiMICRE evaluation.","3-Dimensional;3D Print;Achievement;Address;African American;Algebra;Biology;Biomedical Engineering;Biomimetics;Collaborations;Communities;Computer Analysis;Computer software;Computer-Aided Design;Consumption;Critical Thinking;Data;Disadvantaged;Educational Assessment;Educational Curriculum;Electromagnetics;Employment;Engineering;Environment;Evaluation;Failure;Foundations;Future Teacher;Geometry;Goals;Health Sciences;High School Student;Hispanic Americans;Individual;Industry;Instruction;K-12 student;Knowledge;Lasers;Learning;Liquid substance;Mathematics;Measures;Medical;Modeling;Morphologic artifacts;Motion;Occupations;Online Systems;Outcome;Patient Self-Report;Phase;Physics;Population Heterogeneity;Printing;Problem Solving;Prosthesis Design;Questionnaires;Research;Resources;STEM career;School-Age Population;Science;Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics;Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics Education;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Software Engineering;Solid;Structure;Students;System;Teacher Professional Development;Testing;Time;Underrepresented Populations;Woman;Work;base;career;cost;cost effective;design;digital;engineering design;essays;experience;fitness;gaming environment;high school;improved;improved outcome;industry partner;innovation;interest;learning strategy;mathematical ability;mathematical difficulties;mathematical sciences;mathematics content;mimetics;multidisciplinary;peer;phase 1 testing;precalculus;programs;project-based learning;prototype;real world application;response;simulation;simulation game;skills;software development;student participation;success;tool;training project;twelfth grade;usability;virtual;virtual environment","A Virtual Project-Based Learning Sandbox for Mimetics and Medically Inspired Classroom Engineering (MiMICRE)","Project NarrativeOver three-quarters of today's ten fastest-growing occupations require a background in science technologyengineering and mathematics (STEM) yet nearly two-thirds of U.S. students entering high school scored belowthe proficient level in math on the 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress; furthermore womenAfrican Americans Hispanic Americans and disadvantaged individuals continue to be underrepresented as apercentage of the STEM workforce.

"Genetics","Project Summary/AbstractMutations play a fundamental role in the etiology of many diseases including cancers diabetesepilepsy schizophrenia and others. Many of these mutations result from translesion synthesisa pathway the cell uses to bypass DNA damage during DNA replication. In translesionsynthesis the high-fidelity classical DNA polymerase (i.e. the one involved in normal DNAreplication) encounters DNA damage and stalls. Low-fidelity non-classical polymerases arerecruited to the stalled replication fork where they carry out replication of the damaged DNA.Each non-classical polymerase is specialized for incorporating nucleotides opposite a few typesof DNA damage. When the proper non-classical polymerase is used damage bypass is notmutagenic. When an improper one is used it is mutagenic. The overall goal of the proposedresearch is to understand the factors that affect the accuracy and efficiency of translesionsynthesis. We are particularly interested in examining how non-classical polymerases areselected and regulated during translesion synthesis. Little is known about non-classicalpolymerase selection and regulation because these polymerases function within dynamicmulti-protein complexes (bypass complexes) that are difficult to study. We are using aninnovative and novel combination of biochemical biophysical and structural approaches thatwill allow us to overcome these challenges. In Aim 1 we will examine the architecture of bypasscomplexes using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) experiments. InAim 2 we will examine the regulation of bypass complexes using steady state and pre-steadystate kinetics studies. In Aim 3 we will examine the structure of bypass complexes using X-raycrystallography small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations.","Address;Adopted;Affect;Architecture;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biophysics;Bypass;Catalytic Domain;Cell Death;Cells;Complex;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Polymerase I;DNA Replication Damage;DNA biosynthesis;DNA replication fork;DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Enzymes;Epilepsy;Etiology;Eukaryota;Fluorescence;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer;Genome Stability;Genomic Instability;Goals;Individual;Kinetics;Lead;Lesion;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Molecular Conformation;Multiprotein Complexes;Mutation;Nucleotides;Pathway interactions;Play;Polymerase;Process;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Resolution;Roentgen Rays;Role;Schizophrenia;Structure;Testing;Ubiquitin;Work;Wrist;X-Ray Crystallography;base;disease-causing mutation;experimental study;flexibility;innovation;interest;mutant;novel;novel strategies;recruit;simulation;single molecule;tool","Mechanisms of Damaged DNA Replication in Eukaryotes","Project NarrativeMutations which play a fundamental role in causing many diseases mainly arise during thereplication of damaged DNA.

"Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Peripheral Neuropathy","AbstractCMT affects 1/2500 people and there are no proven treatments that modify the disease. Clinicaland basic research in inherited peripheral neuropathies is expanding rapidly on many fronts.Next generation sequencing enables the identification of novel genetic causes such that > 90genes causing CMT neuropathy have now been identified many by sites within the INC.Rational therapeutic approaches for the most common subtypes of CMT are being activelypursued or have even already developed.

"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Peripheral Neuropathy; Physical Activity; Prevention; Rare Diseases","SUMMARY: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a family of inherited peripheral neuropathies. CMT ischaracterized by progressive weakness imbalance sensory loss and gait abnormalities. Multiple promisingcandidate therapies will be ready for human clinical trials within 5 years. We in the Inherited NeuropathiesConsortium Rare Disease Clinical Research Network (INC RDCRN) have defined the natural history of CMT1Aand this research continues in other CMT subtypes. The INC RDCRN has also led development of multipleclinical outcome assessments and patient-reported outcome measures for children and adults with CMT.Individuals with CMT identify impairments in gait and balance as highly impacting their quality of life and thereforetherapeutic interventions that positively impact these functions are likely to be meaningful. In preparation forclinical trials in CMT some critical gaps in trial readiness must be urgently filled including precise knowledge ofreal world physical activity in individuals with different types of CMT and the effect of disease progression onphysical activity. Sensitive biomarkers of gait and balance dysfunction are also needed for early phase trials todetect signals of therapeutic effect. Research at INC sites using 3D motion analysis laboratories suggests thatgait parameters including gait speed and stride length are highly responsive to change in individuals with CMT.3D motion analysis laboratories are however not viable for multicenter trials. Wearable technology includingactivity monitors and inertial sensors is easily applied and suitable to measure physical activity gait and balancein multicenter studies involving children and adults. Clinical Research Project 3 Wearable Sensor Measures forPhysical Activity Gait and Balance in CMT addresses these gaps of clinical trial readiness. The aims of thisproject include: (1) Characterization of real world function in CMT by measuring habitual physical activity ofchildren and adults with the most common genetic subtypes. (2) Validation of digital biomarkers of gait andbalance deficits in CMT by assessment of the reliability and responsiveness to change of wearable sensors. Dr.J. Burns (U. Sydney) and Dr. K.

"Biotechnology; Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Peripheral Neuropathy; Rare Diseases","AbstractGenetics is at the core of CMT diagnoses pathophysiology and preparation for trials and gene therapyapproaches. The latter requires precise genetic diagnosis for each individual patient and genetics will also behighly informative for long-term outcomes. However even with 90+ CMT and related genes identified over50% of CMT2 patients do not receive a diagnosis today. This gap in heritability has many potentialexplanations including additional CMT genes to be discovered non-coding mutations unconventionalvariation (i.e. repeat expansions) oligogenic inheritance and Variants of Unknown Significance. Our long-termcommitment to the genetic modifier study in CMT1A has yielded a genome wide significant association(GWAS) of SIPA1L2 as the first CMT1A modifier gene. Importantly this discovery promises a novel strategy tocorrect the increased gene dosage of PMP22. The INC has collected 1700 samples of CMT1A patients andanother 1000 are expected over the next five years. With new statistical methods and genome sequencingnow available we will bring this unparalleled effort to its full potential by combining all these strengths andcomprehensively define the genetic architecture of CMT1A. We anticipate that some of these risk factors haveeffects on other more common types of CMT such as CMT1B CMTX and CMT2A. Over the past fundingperiod we have discovered 22+ novel CMT and related genes including a CMT causing repeat expansiondisease. We will continue this work but focus on improving our sample and data resources in size andancestral diversity. This will be achieved by further expanding data sharing with CMT-ID AOINC and the MRCin the UK. We will develop a CMT genetic data archive and utilize the GENESIS genomic software platformthat has helped to discover most of the above mentioned CMT genes. Finally in the previous funding cycle wehave created the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Browser (INVB) to collect disease related variation in CMTgenes internationally and provide this information openly to the community. Given our specialized interest inCMT and related disorders and our international reach this CMT-focused effort goes far beyond the reach ofNIH ClinVar. We will develop INVB version 2.0 that includes more data additional correlations and deeperinformation on VUS. Specifically we propose to (1) Perform an Iterative expansion of modifier studies inCMT1A and other relatively common CMT subtypes (2) Build a sustained infrastructure for data sharing andcontinued discovery of new CMT genes and (3) Develop the CMT variant browser 2.0 that will also provide aphenotype bank for CMT enabling patients and investigators to rapidly obtain diagnostic and de-identifiedclinical information on disease causing mutations.","Address;Alleles;Bioinformatics;Case Study;ClinVar;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Collaborations;Communities;Computer software;DNA;Data;Data Set;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Family;FarGo;Functional disorder;Funding;Gene Dosage;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Research;Genomic medicine;Genomics;Genotype;Hereditary Motor and Sensory-Neuropathy Type II;Heritability;Infrastructure;International;Laboratories;Link;Mutation;Natural History;Neurologist;Neuromuscular Diseases;Neuropathy;Oligogenic Traits;Outcome;Outcome Measure;PMP22 gene;Patients;Phenotype;Preparation;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Sampling;Statistical Data Interpretation;Statistical Methods;Technology;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Work;data archive;data infrastructure;data resource;data sharing;disease-causing mutation;gene discovery;gene therapy;genetic architecture;genetic disorder diagnosis;genome sequencing;genome wide association study;genome-wide;hereditary neuropathy;improved;individual patient;interest;international center;novel;novel strategies;outcome prediction;outreach;protective allele;success;targeted treatment;training opportunity;trial design;variant of unknown significance;virtual;whole genome","Identifying genetic factors that cause and modify CMT (Project 2)","Project NarrativePer RFA  do not complete.","NINDS","10254266","7/26/2021","RFA-TR-18-020","5U54NS065712-14","5","U54","NS","065712","14","","","9/30/2009","6/30/2024","ZTR1-RD-8","6126","8147824","ZUCHNER, STEPHAN ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","238971"," ","210191","28780"," "," ",
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Peripheral Neuropathy; Rare Diseases","Abstract Charcot Marie Tooth diseases (CMT) are heritable peripheral neuropathies and are the most commongenetic neuromuscular disease affecting 1:2500 individuals. CMT1A is the most common subtype affectingapproximately 1:4000 patients with CMT caused by a recurring 1.4 Mb duplication within chromosome17p11.2 in the region containing the PMP22 gene. CMTX1 (1:25000) CMT1B (1:36000) and CMT2A(1:36000) are the next most frequent forms and are caused by many different mutations in the GJB1 MPZand MFN2 genes respectively. Recent progress on these four forms of CMT has led to clinical trials that havebegun or will be ready to begin in the upcoming RDCRN cycle. Although the severity may vary in between patients individual CMT patients often progress slowly sothat sensitive outcome measures and biomarkers are needed for clinical trials. The Inherited NeuropathyConsortium (INC) has developed clinical outcome assessments (COAs) - including the Rasch modified CMTNeuropathy or Exam Scores (CMTNS-R/CMTES-R) and the CMT Pediatric Score (CMTPedS) - that canmeasure progression in adults and children with CMT1A within a two-year interval. The INC has recentlydeveloped patient reported outcomes (PROs) to measure disease burden (CMT Health Index; CMT-HI) andfunctional outcome measures (CMT-FOM) in adults. INC sites have also shown that the intramuscular fataccumulation (IMFA) fraction of calf muscles measured by MRI increases over 12 months in patients withCMT1A as a sensitive marker of chronic denervation of muscle and this has been confirmed in a collaborationbetween our London and Iowa sites. The London site also demonstrated that plasma levels of neurofilamentlight (NFL) a measure of axonal degeneration are elevated and correlate with severity in CMT1A. Incollaboration with Dr. Svaren a member of the INC External Advisory Committee (EAC) from the University ofWisconsin our Iowa site demonstrated that PMP22 mRNA and other Schwann cell genes are increased in skinbiopsies from patients with CMT1A compared to controls. We believe that the INC is uniquely situated to nowintegrate these various COAs in longitudinal studies and that this will enable high quality clinical trials inCMT1A CMTX1 CMT1B and CMT2A as well as in rarer forms of CMT all of which may be amenable totherapy in the upcoming RDCRN cycle. In Clinical Research Project 1 we propose to (1) Complete the longitudinal analysis of COA andbiomarkers in adults and children with CMT1A (2) Determine the relative responsiveness of our prior andnovel COAs CMTES-R CMT-FOM and CMT-HI on a yearly basis for subjects with CMTX1 CMT1B andCMT2A and (3) Determine the relative responsiveness of the COA CMTES-R CMT-FOM and CMT-HI on ayearly basis for subjects with rare forms of CMT. We believe that completion of these aims will enable clinicaltrials for the more common as well as rare forms of CMT.","17p11.2;Adult;Advisory Committees;Affect;Award;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Candidate Disease Gene;Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease;Child;Childhood;Chromosomes;Chronic;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Disease;Ensure;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Health;Heritability;Individual;International;Intramuscular;Iowa;Leg;Light;London;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Messenger RNA;Muscle;Muscle denervation procedure;Mutation;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Natural History;Neuromuscular Diseases;Neuropathy;Outcome Measure;PMP22 gene;Pathogenesis;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phenotype;Plasma;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Schwann Cells;Severities;Site;Skin;Therapeutic Studies;Time;Universities;Wisconsin;axonal degeneration;base;burden of illness;clinical candidate;clinical effect;clinical outcome assessment;clinical predictors;college;design;functional outcomes;gene replacement;hereditary neuropathy;indexing;longitudinal analysis;loss of function;member;neurofilament;novel;novel marker;participant enrollment;trial readiness","Natural History of the Inherited Neuropathies (Project 1)","Project NarrativeDo not include per RFA.","NINDS","10254264","7/26/2021","RFA-TR-18-020","5U54NS065712-14","5","U54","NS","065712","14","","","9/30/2009","6/30/2024","ZTR1-RD-8","6125","1868507","SHY, MICHAEL E.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","238970"," ","210191","28779"," "," ",

"Clinical Research; Data Science; Foodborne Illness; Health Disparities; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Social Determinants of Health","Project summary: Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinkingwater problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution atcommunity water systems with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants.Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity in under-served populations andwithin other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems arethe direct result of managerial negligence inconsistent monitoring and a lack of the ability to anticipate whereproblems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex if we could anticipatewhere health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future it could have an immediateand positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly extensive data about waterquality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large disparate databases. Thesedatabases are largely ignored and when used are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively.Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases which contain histories of administrativeviolations and sub-threshold water-quality results can be mined to accurately predict future drinking watercrises. The Superior Statistical Research R&D team is an internationally recognized group of water expertswith cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing water-quality monitoring ofbiological and chemical contaminants and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality andhealth information to actionable steps for individuals organizations and communities. In this Phase I projectwe will show that it is possible to predict water-related health-based problem areas utilizing already collectedhistorical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing thedisparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa).We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate ourmethods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finallywe will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health-based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will thendemonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-basedpredictions can be presented to customers in an economical usable form. Proof of our concept and profitabilitymodels in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization andimprovement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonizeddatasets identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas and proven financial models our technologywill ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually.","Acute;Address;Algorithms;American;Area;Biological Monitoring;Chemicals;Cities;Coal;Communities;Community Surveys;Complex;Cost Savings;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Databases;Ensure;Exposure to;Filtration;Focus Groups;Future;Gastroenteritis;Goals;Government;Health;Human;Individual;International;Iowa;Lead;Lead levels;Link;Location;Machine Learning;Methods;Michigan;Modeling;Monitor;Municipalities;Negligence;Pathway interactions;Performance;Persons;Phase;Pollution;Price;Provider;Public Health;ROC Curve;Recording of previous events;Records;Research;Safety;Sampling;Serinus;Site;Surveys;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Translating;Trust;Underserved Population;Vulnerable Populations;Water;advocacy organizations;base;commercialization;data harmonization;data integration;drinking water;economic impact;health disparity;high risk;improved;inner city;innovation;large scale data;member;pollutant;predictive modeling;research and development;rural area;statistics;water quality;water sampling;water testing;willingness to pay","Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises","Project NarrativeUp to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems butpredicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large andcomplex obstacle.

Most children with pancreatitis have a single mild acute episode that resolveswithout complications. However a subset of children with AP develops recurrent episodes(defined as acute recurrent pancreatitis or ARP) and some progress to chronic pancreatitis(CP). Pediatric ARP and CP significantly impact quality of life and carry high healthcare costs.Few studies have been performed to characterize the natural history pediatric ARP and CP toidentify its risk factors and to determine predictors of disease course. As INSPPIRE(INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) the first multicentermultidisciplinary collaboration in pediatric pancreatitis we determined that children with ARPharbor multiple genetic risk variants and rapidly transition to CP exocrine pancreaticinsufficiency (EPI) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The risk factors that predispose children toearly onset pancreatitis rapid progression to CP and premature loss of exocrine andendocrine function are not well-known. The objective of this application is to delineate thenatural history of pediatric CP through careful prospective analysis of INSPPIRE-2 cohort todefine the impact of genetic modifiers on disease course and to determine the mechanismsinvolved in pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (T3cDM). The overall hypothesis is that geneticfactors predispose children to early onset CP EPI and DM. Our specific aims are: 1)Characterize pediatric CP determine predictors of disease onset and progression; 2) Determinethe impact of genetic variants on disease onset and progression; 3) Identify mechanismsunderlying disturbed glucose regulation in pediatric ARP and CP. This project will provideinsight into the pathophysiology of pediatric pancreatitis investigate the impact of geneticvariants on disease course and explore the mechanisms of early islet cell dysfunction inpediatric ARP and CP. Our long-term goal is to develop diagnostic modalities prognostic factorsand innovative treatment approaches for pediatric ARP and CP.","Acute;Adult;Age;Aggressive course;Ancillary Study;Autoantibodies;Autoimmunity;Beta Cell;C-Peptide;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Cognitive Therapy;Cohort Analysis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Defect;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Progression;Endocrine;Environmental Risk Factor;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency;Fibrosis;Functional disorder;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Risk;Genetic Screening;Glucagon;Glucose;Goals;Health Care Costs;Hyperlipidemia;Hypertriglyceridemia;Image;Impaired health;Incidence;Insulin;Interdisciplinary Study;International;Islet Cell;Longitudinal cohort study;Modality;Natural History;Onset of illness;Outcome;Pain;Pancreatic Polypeptide;Pancreatitis;Pathogenicity;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Pediatric cohort;Peptides;Physiologic calcification;Prediabetes syndrome;Predisposing Factor;Prevalence;Prognostic Factor;Quality of life;Recurrence;Research Personnel;Risk;Risk Factors;SPINK1 gene;Susceptibility Gene;Testing;Therapeutic;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Work;acute pancreatitis;blood glucose regulation;burden of illness;chronic pancreatitis;clinical predictors;cohort;demographics;disability;early onset;genetic risk factor;genetic variant;genomic locus;glucagon-like peptide 1;glucose tolerance;health related quality of life;innovation;insight;islet;longitudinal analysis;premature;prospective;response;risk variant","INSPPIRE: A Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pediatric Chronic Pancreatitis to Predict Clinical Course and Identify Disease Modifiers","Project NarrativeChronic pancreatitis (CP) is an emerging but poorly understood condition in children that significantly impactsquality of life with high healthcare costs.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza","ABSTRACTRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious pneumovirus that infects over 70% of children underone year of age and nearly 100% of children by age two. Due to the poor immunological memory generatedafter disease resolution RSV produces recurrent outbreaks of infection that contribute to viral dissemination inthe community. RSV produces various clinical manifestations ranging from rhinitis and otitis media to moresevere diseases such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis. In addition to the respiratory disease caused by RSVclinical reports have described the development of neurological symptoms in around 2% of RSV-infectedchildren. Since most children get infected by RSV every year this fraction of the infected population canrepresent a significant number of patients. Neurological symptoms include non-febrile seizures central apnealethargy feeding/swallowing difficulties muscular tone abnormalities strabismus cerebrospinal uid (CSF)alterations and encephalopathy. Supporting these observations similar results have been obtained using themurine model of RSV infection including the demonstration that RSV causes viremia and infection of thenervous system (CNS). Strikingly RSV infected mice and rats show both learning and behavioral alterationsafter one month of infection. We have described that mice infected by RSV have altered blood brain barrier(BBB) permeability exhibit increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in the brain and CNS cells such asastrocytes are actively infected by RSV. Considering the burden of RSV-infection in children such a finding isof high interest for public health. However the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for RSVdissemination into the CNS and the cognitive/behavioral manifestations remain unknown. We believe that thetype of inflammatory response triggered by RSV infection in the lungs favors the development of the CNSalterations. Our studies suggest that RSV is able to infect the CNS and promote cognitive/behavioralimpairment due to the alteration of the blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Thus the opening of the BBBcould allow RSV and/or the inflammatory cells to infiltrate the brain. Based on these observations our centralhypothesis is that the inflammatory response elicited by RSV infection leads to neurological alterations causedby increased permeability of the BBB the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the CNS and the infection ofnerve cells. The specific aims of this grant will address the pathological processes of RSV infection and itseffects on the CNS. This will be achieved by determining the structural and functional changes at the BBBfollowing RSV infection and identifying the brain cells that are infected by RSV as well as its infection kineticsin mice. The results obtained in this proposal will provide a better understanding of the neuropathology causedby RSV and the possible detrimental effects at the CNS in humans. Moreover the knowledge of themodulation of the mechanism of RSV brain infection and its host inflammatory response could generate newtools that can help to prevent the consequences of RSV infection over the CNS.","1 year old;2 year old;Acute;Address;Affect;Age;Alveolitis;Animals;Antibodies;Astrocytes;Behavior;Behavioral;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Bronchiolitis;Cells;Central Nervous System Diseases;Central Sleep Apnea;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Cessation of life;Child;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;Communities;Control Animal;Data;Deglutition;Development;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Emergency department visit;Encephalopathies;Exhibits;Genetic Materials;Goals;Grant;Hospitalization;Human;Immune response;Immunologic Memory;Impaired cognition;Infant;Infection;Infectious Agent;Infiltration;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Intensive Care Units;Kinetics;Knowledge;Learning;Lethargies;Lower Respiratory Tract Infection;Lung;Lung diseases;Lung infections;Molecular;Mus;Muscle;Nerve Tissue;Neurologic;Neurologic Symptoms;Neurons;Otitis Media;Outpatients;Pathologic Processes;Patients;Play;Pneumonia;Pneumovirus;Population;Private Practice;Public Health;Rattus;Recurrence;Reporter;Reporting;Resolution;Respiration;Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections;Respiratory syncytial virus;Rhinitis;Role;Seasons;Strabismus;Structure;Testing;Viral;Viremia;Virus;Virus Diseases;Visit;World Health Organization;base;behavioral impairment;blood-brain barrier permeabilization;brain cell;brain tissue;cognitive process;cytokine;design;epidemiology study;experimental study;feeding;insight;interest;learned behavior;lung injury;mouse model;nervous system infection;neuropathology;prevent;recruit;symptomatology;tool;virus genetics","RSV-induced inflammation in the brain","Project Narrative (100 words)Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common infectious agent that affects children lessthan two years of age.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Data Science; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD)","Project SummaryOverview of research: The Reuel Group at Iowa State University (founded Fall 2016) seeks to develop newmaterials methods and measurement devices for biomanufacturing biotherapeutics and biosensors. Wehave active work-streams in 1) optical nanosensors for protein binding enzymatic activity and cell membranedisruption 2) scalable and reliable cell free protein synthesis (CFPS) methods for protein prototyping (extractand genetic template improvements) 3) microfluidics for droplet generation and measurement of CFPSproducts interrogated by nanosensors 4) algorithms for `big data' generated from nanosensors (machinelearning and deep learning methods) 5) engineered endospores for time-delayed synthetic biology circuitsand 6) resonant radio frequency sensors for biomanufacturing wound healing and water quality. The overallvision of the research program is to simplify and improve the design and manufacturing of biological products(cells and proteins) for applications in therapies advanced materials and bio-electronics. Protein basedtherapies have demonstrated in clinic to be a potent tool in the treatment of many diseases. In recent yearsthe design build and test cycle to find therapies for new disease targets has improved dramatically usingtechniques such as surface display coupled to evolutionary selection. However these mutagenic approacheshave a few limitations namely: 1) they require a suitable naturally occurring sequence as a starting point 2)they frequently optimize solely on a single desired feature and 3) they operate as a `black box' meaning thatgeneralizable design rules for in silico prediction of future products is not possible. It is the purpose of thisMIRA for ESI research plan to design a closed-loop system that allows for unsupervised design and discoveryof protein therapeutics that overcomes these limitations. Over the next five years we will build and integratethe system components which include enzymatic DNA synthesis coupled to cell free protein synthesis torapidly prototype libraries of custom proteins in micro-droplet reactors. These proteins will then becharacterized in the micro-droplets using optical nanosensors to test for desired features such as stabilitybinding affinity selectivity hydrolytic activity and/or membrane penetration. This will produce a large labeleddata set (tying sequence to phenotypic properties) that can be used to train a deep learning neural network toself-determine sequence patterns for specific properties. Once the tuning coefficients of the network arefound the algorithm will then predict next best sequences which will be synthesized tested etc. such that thedesign loop progresses unsupervised until optimization criteria are met. This new approach will result in fasterdevelopment of protein therapies that are optimized based on multiple criteria and not tied to existing naturalsequences. For patients this translates to more efficacious therapies with less side effects and a potential forreduced cost (due to shortened design timeline). At the end of the five-year project we will seek to translatethis technology via NIH SBIR funding such that the new technology can make an impact on actual therapies.","Affinity;Algorithms;Big Data;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological Products;Biological Response Modifier Therapy;Biomanufacturing;Biosensor;Cell membrane;Cells;Clinic;Coupled;Custom;DNA biosynthesis;Data Set;Development;Devices;Disease;Electronics;Engineering;Funding;Future;Generations;Genetic Template;In Vitro;Iowa;Label;Libraries;Machine Learning;Measurement;Membrane;Methods;Microfluidics;Optics;Patients;Pattern;Penetration;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Property;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Engineering;Proteins;Research;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Speed;Stream;Surface;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Uses;Time;TimeLine;Training;Translating;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Vision;Work;base;cost;deep learning;deep neural network;design;efficacious treatment;falls;improved;in silico;learning strategy;nanosensors;new technology;novel strategies;programs;prototype;radio frequency;sensor;side effect;synthetic biology;therapeutic protein;tool;treatment optimization;water quality;wound healing","Unsupervised optimization of protein therapeutics using closed-loop in vitro synthesis nanosensing and deep-learning","Project NarrativeThis project seeks to develop advanced tools to enable faster discovery and design of protein-based drugs fornew disease targets.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary / AbstractDiagnostic errors are increasingly recognized as a cause of pain suffering and increasedhealthcare costs. Diagnostic delays are an important class of diagnostic errors. While manydiagnostic errors occur in hospital settings emergency departments visits may be especiallyimportant to consider because they treat critically ill patients and because most decisions toadmit patients to the hospital are made in emergency departments. Thus to enable a morecomplete understanding of diagnostic delays requires consideration of healthcare visits across arange of healthcare settings including clinic visits emergency department visits andhospitalizations.Delays in diagnosing infectious diseases are important to consider. For contagious infectiousdiseases diagnostic delays increase the risk of additional exposures potentially generatingmore cases. Second many infectious diseases can be effectively treated but even short delaysin treatment lead to worse clinical outcomes. However with the exception of a few infectiousdiseases (e.g. tuberculosis) diagnostic delays for infectious diseases are understudied. Thusthere is a critical need to investigate the incidence risk factors and clinical impact for diagnosticdelays for infectious diseases.The overarching goal of our research is to investigate diagnostic delays associated withinfectious diseases using existing data along with methods from the fields of computer scienceand statistics. While our research relies upon big data we will also use clinical experts toreview and contribute to all of our results. Our subject matter experts incorporate expertise ininfectious diseases emergency medicine acute care medical education diagnostic reasoninghealthcare epidemiology public health industry and professional infectious disease societies.Specifically we will 1) determine the incidence of diagnostic delays for a wide range ofinfectious diseases; 2) identify the risk factors associated with diagnostic delays for infectiousdiseases that are frequently delayed or have serious outcomes; and 3) estimate the impact ofdiagnostic delays in terms of healthcare costs and mortality. With our data methods and clinicalexperts we will be able to translate our results into future interventions designed to decreasediagnostic delays and improve healthcare outcomes. In addition while our proposal focuses oninfectious diseases the methods and approaches that we will develop can be adopted toinvestigate non-infectious diseases and conditions."," ","An expert-guided machine-learning approach to estimate the incidence risk and harms associated with diagnostic delays for infectious diseases.","Project NarrativeDiagnostic delays for infectious diseases contribute to worse clinical outcomes increasedhealthcare costs and for some infectious diseases outbreaks of great public health importance.We will use existing large data sets along with machine-learning techniques and expert clinicalguidance to detect patterns of healthcare visits representing diagnostic delays.

Poor blood pressure (BP)control increases the risk of myocardial infarction stroke and death and is often due to delays in treatmentintensification. We have developed a telehealth service called Centralized Healthcare Solutions that hassuccessfully delivered clinical pharmacy services remotely to private physician offices especially in smallmedical offices and rural locations. In our prior work we demonstrated that a physician-pharmacistcollaboration could cost effectively reduce BP but pharmacists spent a considerable proportion of their timeobtaining and aggregating patients' home BP measurements. Thus we have developed an additional m-health solution called What's your BP? (WyBP) a custom- built bi-directional SMS-based (short messageservice or texting) platform. WyBP is inexpensive (i.e. does not require investment in smartphonetechnology or WiFi) acceptable to a broad range of patients (including the elderly and rural populations)scalable to subject volume observed in busy clinical settings and easily integrated into typical clinicworkflows. In two pilots we demonstrated a high rate of adherence indicating that patients were willing andable to take home BP measurements and send them to our research team. This proposal combines our twoprior efforts to use remotely located pharmacists and bi-directional texting to improve efficiencies reducecost and improve access to a dedicated pharmacist. A major gap in our knowledge is whether the potencyof a virtual team member can be improved by home BP monitoring with technological support especiallyin small medical offices. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether our scalable SMS approachcombined with a pharmacist-based intervention improves BP management cost effectively. To achieve thisobjective we will determine if our intervention leads to decreases in BP; determine if our intervention leadsto intensification of therapy; and determine the cost effectiveness of the intervention. At the end of thisproject we expect to provide a novel scalable and cost-effective approach for treating hypertension in ruralpopulations by expanding the feasibility scalability and dissemination of the Centralized HealthcareSolutions intervention.

"Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Urologic Diseases; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTLower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are common and have a significant negative impact on the lives of adultmen and women. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was formed in2012 to address research gaps related to the care of patients with LUTS. The long-term goals of the Universityof Iowa LURN Research Site are to better treat and prevent lower urinary tract dysfunction in men and women.Toward this goal additional research is required to better characterize and understand clinically-useful LUTSpatient subtypes and to better measure the full patient experience related to the broad range of LUTS. TheIowa Research Site thus proposes to perform multicenter and multidisciplinary research with other LURN sitesto 1) Test and refine LURN symptom-based clusters including a wider range of symptom severity and a widerrange of physiological measures than performed in prior studies 2) Assess the relationship between physicalactivity and sleep (important non-urologic factors related to LUTS) and LUTS and LUTS treatment response 3)Determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional components viaurodynamic testing 4) Identify protein biomarker signatures contained within plasma of specific subgroups ofmen and women with LUTS and 5) Validate a comprehensive outcome tool for men and women with LUTS.To address these aims several distinct but complementary studies are proposed. LURN will perform a 3-yearcohort study of men and women with a diverse spectrum of LUTS severity and characterize them withstandardized clinical evaluations self-reported symptoms and associated conditions quality of life voidingdiaries and detailed information on treatments and treatment response over time. Wearable health trackingdevices and smartphone text messaging technologies will be utilized to collect objective physical activity andsleep quality data from cohort study participants. Additionally participants will complete the LURNComprehensive Assessment of Self-Reported Urinary Symptoms  Outcome Measure (CASUS-OM) to test itsinternal consistency validity and responsiveness to change after LUTS treatments. In another study womenwith urgency and urgency urinary incontinence will undergo a battery of standardized urodynamic testsfocused on sensory and motor functions of the urethra and bladder. Lastly analysis of protein biomarkersignatures will be performed using plasma samples previously collected from men and women with LUTS.Important findings from these significant LURN research efforts will help improve the clinical care of LUTSpatients and will inform the development of future LUTS clinical studies.","Address;Adult;Affect;Award;Behavioral;Biological;Biological Markers;Bladder;Caffeine;Cellular Phone;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Communities;Complex;Consensus;Data;Development;Devices;Disease;Enrollment;Ensure;Food;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Goals;Health;Health Personnel;Intake;Interdisciplinary Study;Internist;Intervention;Iowa;Irritants;Knowledge;Leadership;Link;Liquid substance;Lower urinary tract;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Motor;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Participant;Patient Care;Patient Monitoring;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Phenotype;Physical activity;Physiological;Plasma;Protein Analysis;Protocols documentation;Publications;Quality of life;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Sampling;Self Assessment;Sensory;Severities;Site;Sleep;Standardization;Subgroup;Symptoms;Technology;Testing;Text Messaging;Time;Treatment outcome;Universities;Urethra;Urinary Incontinence;Urinary tract;Urodynamics;Urologic Diseases;Urologist;Woman;Work;base;biomarker signature;clinical care;clinical infrastructure;clinical research site;cohort;common symptom;diagnosis evaluation;diaries;expectation;experience;health related quality of life;improved;lower urinary tract symptoms;mHealth;men;micturition urgency;multidisciplinary;novel;patient subsets;prevent;protein biomarkers;recruit;research clinical testing;sleep quality;success;symptom treatment;tool;treatment response;urinary","University of Iowa LURN Research Site","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis project will help health care providers better identify patients with clinically important subtypes of lowerurinary tract dysfunction with the goals of better understanding mechanisms of disease and of improvingtreatment outcomes.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetic Testing; Genetics; Precision Medicine","Project SummaryAn unexpected response from a minority of cells can have a dramatic impact on the development prognosis andtreatment of disease. For example in the progression of cancer a resistant minority of circulating tumor cells(CTCs) lead to the development of refractory metastases at relapse. We are only just beginning to uncover thesephenomena and the underlying biological mechanisms because they are obscured at the bulk scale. Detection ofa rare mutation can require the analysis of hundreds to thousands of individual cells. We have developed adielectrophoresis (DEP)-based device with a high yield of selective single-cell capture in an array ofmicrochambers arranged along the sides of branched microfluidic channels. An important point is that DEP-basedselection is marker-independent which critically makes this approach especially relevant to the identification ofCTCs in melanoma for which there are no reliable biomarkers (cell surface antigens). We propose to integrategenetic assays into this platform for the identification of a mutation that is an indicator for a specificchemotherapeutic agent that is in widespread use. Specifically we will create devices and methods to assessmutations by incorporating structures and custom materials that facilitate on-chip end-point polymerase chainreaction (PCR). An important feature of our technology is that the transfer of cells into reaction chambers (forgenetic analysis) is accomplished using simple fluidic and electrokinetic components (no moving parts). Thistechnological development is significant because 1) it addresses a need for integrated marker-free selectionisolation and analysis of single cells 2) the platform is sufficiently simple for broad application in clinicallaboratories thus enabling characterization of CTCs isolated from individual patients and 3) it will enable futurebasic research into the molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance in melanoma. This innovative combinationof a platform for marker-free selection with detection of mutations in melanoma will transform melanomatreatment and research because it will allow unparalleled access to information regarding the distribution ofmutations related to susceptibility or resistance to therapeutic agents among individual CTCs.","Access to Information;Address;Architecture;Basic Science;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Blood Cells;Blood Tests;Carcinoma;Cell Line;Cell Separation;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinic;Clinical;Consumption;Custom;Cytolysis;DNA;Detection;Development;Devices;Disease;Drug resistance;Effectiveness;Equipment;Evaluation;Exclusion;Exhibits;Foundations;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;Genomic DNA;Hydrophobicity;Individual;Intervention;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Leukocytes;Light;Liquid substance;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Melanoma Cell;Methodology;Methods;Microfluidics;Minority;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Mutation;Mutation Detection;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organ;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Peripheral;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Phase;Physicians;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Predisposition;Procedures;Prognosis;Property;Protocols documentation;Reaction;Reagent;Refractory;Relapse;Research;Resistance;Resolution;Sampling;Side;Somatic Mutation;Structure;Surface Antigens;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Treatment Step;Work;base;cancer therapy;cell type;chemotherapeutic agent;cost effective;crosslink;dielectric property;electric field;evaporation;genetic analysis;individual patient;individualized medicine;innovation;melanoma;method development;mutant;mutational status;nanolitre scale;novel strategies;operation;patient stratification;patient subsets;personalized medicine;predicting response;prevent;response;seal;single cell analysis;single cell technology;therapy resistant;treatment research;tumor;tumor progression;vapor","Parallel Selective Capture of Single Circulating Melanoma Cells and Integrated On-Chip Determination of Mutational Status","Project NarrativeThe spread of cancer from a localized tumor to other organs is responsible for the vast majority of cancer-relateddeaths.

"Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Regenerative Medicine","Project SummaryHallmarks of nemaline myopathy (NM) are electron dense rods in myofibers muscle weakness and lack ofmuscle regeneration (Sanoudou et al. 2006; Wallgren-Pettersson et al. 2011). Twelve genes have beenclosely linked to NM (Jungbluth et al. 2018). Despite our advanced understanding of NM that defects of thesarcomeric thin filament cause sarcomeric weakness it still remains unclear how these structural flaws triggermuscle atrophy and defective muscle regeneration. There is therefore an urgent need to identify themechanisms by which the NM-linked molecules influence muscle growth and survival. Our long-term goal is tounderstand roles of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in human development. We recently uncovered a novelactivity of CUL3-KLHL41 a NM-linked ubiquitin ligase complex that it regulates the sensors of the unfoldedprotein response (UPR) of the ER (Kim et al. 2018). In particular the CUL3-KLHL41 complex stronglyregulates the PERK signaling pathway of the UPR in C2C12 myotubes. The UPR plays a critical role in musclegrowth/regeneration and has been implicated in congenital myopathies (Bohnert et al. 2018; Ebert et al. 2012;Miyake et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2002). However UPR dysregulation has not been examined in NM until now.Thus we are in a unique position to reveal a new connection among CUL3 the UPR and NM. The objective ofthis application is to define how CUL3-KLHL41 and other CUL3 adaptor molecules (i.e. KLHL40 KBTBD13etc.) regulate the UPR in muscles. Our central hypothesis is that CUL3 adaptor molecules and possibly otherNM-linked molecules regulate muscle growth via the UPR. The rationale that underlies the proposed researchis that once we achieve the goal we will be able to provide a new concept for pathogenesis diagnosis andnew treatment approaches for NM. To objectively test the hypothesis we will pursue the following specificaims: 1) Establish the mechanism by which CUL3 regulates the UPR in myotubes; 2) Identify additional CUL3adaptor genes whose mutations cause a myopathy in zebrafish. Under the first aim we will identify muscle-specific substrates of CUL3-KLHL41 that regulates the UPR in C2C12 myotubes. We will employ proven RNAimethodology and evaluate changes in the levels of PERK. For the second aim we will determine PERKdysregulation in vivo in stable klhl41 knockout zebrafish lines. Additionally we will employ RNAi methodologyto screen 51 muscle-specific putative CUL3 adaptor molecules (Deshmukh et al. 2015) for PERK regulation inC2C12 myotubes. Top three candidates will be evaluated for PERK dysregulation in zebrafish. Our proposedresearch is innovative in our opinion because the notion that aberrant UPR is an underlying mechanism ofpathological atrophy in NM is new and unexplored. This knowledge is significant because while defects of thethin filaments of the sarcomere are difficult to restore the UPR is amenable to pharmacological interventions.Thus our research will lay a foundation for new pharmacological interventions of NM.","ACTA1 gene;ATF6 gene;Affect;Atrophic;BTB/POZ Domain;Biology;CUL3 gene;Candidate Disease Gene;Cell Death;Cell Survival;Cessation of life;Collagen;Complex;Data;Defect;Diagnosis;Disease;Distal Muscular Dystrophies;Electrons;Endoplasmic Reticulum;FDA approved;Fibroblasts;Foundations;Gene Mutation;Genes;Glean;Goals;Growth;Human;Human Development;Incidence;Intervention;Knock-out;Knowledge;Link;Live Birth;Methodology;Microarray Analysis;Mission;Modeling;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Fibers;Muscle Weakness;Muscular Atrophy;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Mutation;Myopathy;Natural regeneration;Nemaline Myopathies;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Prevention;Procollagen;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;RNA Interference;Regulation;Research;Rod;Role;Sarcomeres;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Structure;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Thin Filament;United States National Institutes of Health;Zebrafish;base;congenital myopathy;craniofacial;disease-causing mutation;in vivo;innovation;muscle regeneration;novel;overexpression;postnatal;prenatal;response;satellite cell;sensor;skeletal disorder;treatment strategy;ubiquitin ligase","Dysregulation of the unfolded protein response of the ER in nemaline myopathy","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research is relevant to public health because knowledge gleaned from this research willsignificantly impact our understanding on pathogenesis treatment strategies and diagnosis of NM and relatedmyopathies.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Project-3 SummaryComplexities in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells of the conducting human and mouse airway were recentlyrevealed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). These studies identified the ionocyte an infrequent celltype that expresses the majority of CFTR in the proximal airway and submucosal gland ducts. They alsoshowed that the repertoire of ion channels in the ionocyte is uniquely suited to potentially regulate airway pH.However whether only ionocytes contribute to innate immunity and clearance in the airways remains to bedetermined; it is possible that other airway cell types such as ciliated cells express CFTR at levels that arebelow the detection limits of scRNAseq yet are functionally important in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.Deeper knowledge of CFTR cellular physiology in the airway will greatly enhance our understanding of CFpathogenesis while also informing the cellular targets for gene therapy of CF lung disease. The proposedproject will focus on understanding the cellular functions of CFTR in ionocytes and ciliated cells and whetherCFTR expression in each of these cell types is required or sufficient to prevent CF lung disease. Ourhypotheses will be tested in genetic ferret models a species that more accurately reflects human CF lungdisease than mice. These studies are possible because of the creation of several new genetic ferret modelsthat can conditionally (in specific cell types) inactivate CFTR expression on a wild-type (WT) background orreactivate CFTR expression on a CF background. Both of these strategies use CreERT2 technologies andenable lineage tracing of the targeted cells in vivo using a fluorescent Cre-reporter. Additionally we propose togenerate a new genetic ferret model in which CFTR is overexpressed specifically in ciliated cells to testwhether high-level ectopic expression therein is sufficient to protect from CF lung disease. Key goals of thisproject are to: 1) define the contributions of CFTR expression in ionocytes and ciliated cells to CF lungpathogenesis 2) determine the half-lives of ionocytes and ciliated cells in the CF and non-CF airway and 3)determine the extent to which CFTR expression in ionocytes and ciliated cells contributes to the regulation ofdisease-relevant features of the airway surface liquid (ASL) (i.e. volume antibacterial activity chloride andbicarbonate transport and pH) and to mucociliary clearance. Each of these goals draws on the unique ability ofthe Engelhardt laboratory to genetically engineer transgenic ferrets to temporally regulate CFTR expression inspecific cell types and to test these models for CF-relevant functional endpoints in vivo and in vitro. Theproposed study is the first to use state-of-art functional genetic approaches in a non-mouse species to tackledifficult cell biology questions relating to CFTR function in the airway and CF lung pathogenesis. This researchis expected to significantly enhance the field's ability to develop effective genetic therapies for CF lung disease.","Address;Adopted;Amphotericin B;Anions;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Area;Bicarbonates;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular biology;Chlorides;Complement;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Duct (organ) structure;Ectopic Expression;Epithelial Cells;Ferrets;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Gland;Goals;Half-Life;Human;In Vitro;Inflammation;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Laboratories;Liquid substance;Lung;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Movement;Mucociliary Clearance;Mus;NON Mouse;Natural Immunity;Pathogenesis;Phenotype;Process;Property;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Pulmonary Fibrosis;Regulation;Reporter;Research;Surface;Technology;Testing;Transgenic Organisms;absorption;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;cell type;cellular targeting;cystic fibrosis airway;defined contribution;detection limit;disease phenotype;epithelial Na+ channel;gain of function;gene complementation;gene replacement;gene therapy;genetic approach;in vivo;loss of function;overexpression;porcine model;prevent;pulmonary function;restoration;single-cell RNA sequencing;synergism","Conducting Airway Cellular Targets Required for Complementation of CF Lung Disease","n/a","NHLBI","10248531","8/16/2021","PAR-18-405","5P01HL152960-02","5","P01","HL","152960","02","","LACHOWICZ-SCROGGINS, MARRAH ELIZABETH","9/1/2020","7/31/2025","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]","6367","1876393","ENGELHARDT, JOHN F","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021","7/31/2022"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," ","486513"," ","314895","171618"," "," ",
"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT 2PROJECT SUMMARYCystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosistransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) apical membrane anion channel. Loss of CFTR-mediated HCO3- and Cl- secretion by airway epithelia impairs respiratory host defenses causing bacterialinfection inflammation mucus accumulation and respiratory failure. One strategy for restoring anionchannel function to the apical membrane is to increase the function of mutant CFTR channels. That hasproven successful for people with specific CFTR mutations. However ~10% of people with CF havemutations that do not respond to CFTR modulators or they are not able to take modulators. Anotherstrategy is to provide an alternative channel. Toward this end we studied amphotericin B (AmB); earlierwork showed that AmB forms anion channels. We discovered that apical AmB increased HCO3- andCl- secretion in cultured CF airway epithelia including those with CFTR-null mutations. AmBincreased ASL pH height and antibacterial activity. AmB is clinically approved to treat fungal infectionsand off-label lung aerosolization has an impressive safety record. Thus AmB could potentially provide anew mutation-agnostic therapy for CF lung disease. However many questions remain unanswered andwe lack important in vivo data. Therefore our overarching goal is to understand the mechanisms ofAmB-induced anion secretion in airway epithelia and to test the hypothesis that AmB can restoreCF host defenses in vivo. To achieve this goal we will answer questions in three aims. Aim 1. Whatmolecular and cellular mechanisms elicit AmB-mediated anion secretion? Without cAMP-dependentregulation and with half the anion selectivity of CFTR AmB is an imperfect substitute for CFTR. We willtest key hypotheses about how AmB functions in airway epithelia. Aim 2. Which epithelial cells doesAmB target and how does AmB alter them? These studies will reveal AmB function in large and smallairway epithelia and diverse cell-types test AmB in airway epithelia remodeled by inflammation and testfor compensatory changes. Aim 3. Does AmB reverse CF host defense defects in vivo? Using CF pigswe will test if nebulized AmB increases ASL pH increases ASL antimicrobial activity and heightincreases mucociliary transport and enhances S. aureus eradication from the lungs. The results ofthese studies will have direct implications for developing a new genotype agnostic approach to treatingCF and will inform development of other therapies in Projects 1 and 3. Our proposals success isenhanced by an ongoing collaboration between the labs of Welsh (Iowa) and Burke (Illinois) byutilization of outstanding cores and by an environment of cooperation between the Programs projectsand investigators. With this background our track record and our commitment we believe this researchcan change the lives of people with CF.","Aerosols;Amphotericin B;Animals;Anions;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Apical;Bacterial Infections;Bicarbonates;Binding;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Distal;Environment;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Family suidae;Future;Genes;Genotype;Gland;Goals;Height;Heterogeneity;Host Defense;Human;Illinois;Impairment;Inflammation;Iowa;Knowledge;Label;Learning;Lung;Mediating;Molecular;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mutation;Mycoses;Nebulizer;Pathogenesis;Play;Property;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Respiratory Failure;Role;Safety;Staphylococcus aureus;Sterols;Surface;Testing;Viscosity;Work;airway epithelium;airway remodeling;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;apical membrane;cell type;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis airway epithelia;improved;in vivo;insight;loss of function mutation;mutant;null mutation;programs;pulmonary function;repaired;respiratory;restoration;success;treatment strategy","Amphotericin B Restoration of Anion Secretion in Cystic Fibrosis Airways","n/a","NHLBI","10248529","8/16/2021","PAR-18-405","5P01HL152960-02","5","P01","HL","152960","02","","LACHOWICZ-SCROGGINS, MARRAH ELIZABETH","9/1/2020","7/31/2025","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]","6366","7772015","WELSH, MICHAEL J.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021","7/31/2022"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," ","475325"," ","363600","111725"," "," ",
"Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/Abstract Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life limiting monogenetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosisconductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The lung disease begins in early childhood and with time airwaysbecome permanently colonized by bacteria inflammation becomes prominent obstruction worsens and ~95%of patients die of respiratory failure. While significant advances have been made with small molecule modulatortherapies to restore function for some CFTR mutation classes ~10% of people with CF have not benefitedfrom these strategies. The goal of these proposed studies is to apply the recent advancements in baseediting technology to correct CFTR mutations in somatic cells with a focus on mutation classes that do notrespond to small molecule modulator therapies. We will investigate a new class of adenine base editors (ABE)that converts AT to GC base pairs. Currently there are 346 well characterized disease-causing variants ofCFTR and of these 66% are point mutations. Of all single nucleotide mutations 46% are potentiallycorrectable using ABE. In this proposal we will use ABE to modify the following 4 CFTR mutations: 1) R553Xand 2) W1282X are the 2nd and 3rd most common premature stop codon mutations. 3) 3849+10kb C>T is asplicing mutation and represents ~12% of CFTR mutations. 4) G551D the 3rd most common disease-causingmutation results in defective protein gating and is responsive to Ivacaftor treatment. Here we propose to: 1)show that base editors will correct CFTR in CF cells and correct the anion transporter defect in vitro 2) definethe cell type preferences of editing and the role of cell division in airway cells and 3) correct the anion channeldefect in primary airway epithelia as well as critical disease phenotypes in the airways of a pig CF model. Projects 1 2 and 3 (along with the valuable cores) work closely together to directly address thePrograms goal of developing molecular therapies for CF. The Program effectively focuses a team of talentedlaboratories to address a shared goal in a highly collaborative environment. Our track record supports ourcommitment to improving the lives of people with CF and increasing our understanding of lung biology. Our goal is to provide a life-long gene repair strategy that could be adapted to for many CF causingmutations. This proposed research is highly innovative. The reagents methods and data generated by theseexperiments will provide guidance for base editing for other monogenic disorders thereby significantlyadvancing the gene therapy field.","Address;Adenine;Animal Model;Anions;Bacteria;Base Pairing;Bicarbonates;Biogenesis;Biology;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Cycle;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cell division;Cells;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;Cytidine;DNA;DNA Double Strand Break;Data;Deaminase;Defect;Development;Disease;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Event;Family suidae;Ferrets;Flow Cytometry;Frequencies;Genes;Goals;Growth;Guide RNA;Height;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Host Defense;Human;In Vitro;Inflammation;Interphase Cell;Knowledge;Laboratories;Life;Lung;Lung diseases;Measures;Mediating;Mendelian disorder;Methods;Mismatch Repair;Missense Mutation;Mitotic;Modeling;Molecular;Mucins;Mutation;Nonhomologous DNA End Joining;Nonsense Codon;Nucleotides;Obstruction;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Patients;Peptides;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiology;Point Mutation;Process;Proteins;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;RNA Splicing;Reagent;Regulator Genes;Research;Respiratory Failure;Ribonucleoproteins;Role;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Site;Somatic Cell;Talents;Technology;Testing;Time;Transgenes;Treatment Efficacy;Variant;Viscosity;Work;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;base;cell type;collaborative environment;cystic fibrosis airway;disease phenotype;disease-causing mutation;early childhood;experimental study;functional restoration;gene repair;gene therapy;homologous recombination;improved;in vivo;innovation;insertion/deletion mutation;novel;novel strategies;nuclease;preference;prevent;programs;protein expression;repair strategy;restoration;single-cell RNA sequencing;small molecule;success;targeted nucleases;targeted treatment;therapeutic evaluation;time interval;tool;vector","Gene Editing Strategies to Correct CFTR Mutations","n/a","NHLBI","10248528","8/16/2021","PAR-18-405","5P01HL152960-02","5","P01","HL","152960","02","","LACHOWICZ-SCROGGINS, MARRAH ELIZABETH","9/1/2020","7/31/2025","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]","6365","1961843","MCCRAY, PAUL B","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021","7/31/2022"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," ","441120"," ","340436","100684"," "," ",

CF affects multiple organs including lungspancreas intestine liver sweat glands gallbladder and the male genital tract. Airway infection andinflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality. Although several therapies have improved thelives of patients current treatments are inadequate and CF remains a lethal disease. Our knowledge about thepathogenesis of the disease its progression and the state of the neonatal lung is inadequate. These gaps inour knowledge have hindered attempts to develop better treatments and preventions for CF lung disease. Amajor impediment to addressing these issues had been limitations of animal models. Although mouse strainscarrying null and missense CFTR mutations have made enormous contributions CF mice do not develop theairway or pancreatic disease typically found in humans. We have generated CF ferrets and pigs that replicatemany of the key features of human CF disease including intestinal obstruction exocrine pancreatic destructionmicro-gallbladder vas deferens abnormalities focal biliary cirrhosis congenital airway structural abnormalitiesand airway and sinus infection with time. The goals of the Animal Models Core will be: (1) To provide Programinvestigators with non-CF and CF ferrets and pigs so that they can successfully complete their project aims. (2)To build new genetically engineered CF ferret models that express CFTR in a regulated fashion. (3) To assistprojects in carrying out small molecule delivery the harvesting of biologic samples from live animals (e.g.bronchoalveolar lavage fluid blood and microbiological samples) and the care and analysis of study animals.(4) To assist projects in record keeping and coordinate animal usage among projects.

"No NIH Category available","OVERALL COMPONENTPROJECT SUMMARYCystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-shortening genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure dueto recurrent infections and airway obstruction. While our knowledge of CFTR function has advancedgreatly in the 30 years since the discovery of the gene treatments for the disease remain suboptimal andCF remains progressive and fatal. Advances with small molecule CFTR modulator therapies havehelped restore protein function for many mutations but approximately 10% of people with CF have notbenefited from these strategies including people with nonsense and splicing mutations. The centraltheme of this proposal is developing new molecular therapies to prevent or treat CF lung disease.The goal of our three projects and four cores is to exploit the power of our in vitro and animal models toaddress questions fundamental to lung disease pathogenesis and to use this knowledge to inform newtherapeutic strategies to complement CF defects including gene repair and the addition of a smallmolecule that forms anion channels. The three closely interrelated Projects will work together toaccomplish the following goals: 1) To restore CFTR function using targeted single nucleotideediting. We hypothesize that cells in the surface airway epithelium including those with progenitorcapacity can be targeted to repair CFTR mutations using base editing. 2) To understand themechanisms of amphotericin B (AmB)-induced anion secretion in airway epithelia and to test thehypothesis that AmB can restore CF host defenses in vivo. AmB is a small molecule that formsanion channels. 3) To determine how CFTR expression in pulmonary ionocytes and ciliated cellsregulates properties of the airway surface liquid that are crucial for clearance and innateimmunity. The development of effective gene therapies for cystic fibrosis lung disease must be guidedby a clear understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease and the relevant cellular targets forCFTR gene replacement or editing.The Project Leaders and their teams have outstanding track records of collaborative CF research andhere they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their highly creative research is supported by fourcores that provide innovative infrastructure and services.

Molecular recognition of carbohydrates and peptides has been long-standingchallenges in bioorganic and supramolecular chemistry due to the importance of thesemolecules in biology. The PIs group has developed protein-sized molecularly imprintednanoparticles (MINPs) to bind a wide range of biologically interesting guests includingcarbohydrates and peptides. They are prepared and purified in < 2 days without any specialtechniques once the template functional monomers and cross-linkable surfactants areavailable. MINP-based synthetic lectins were shown to recognize a wide range of mono-and oligosaccharides in water with tens of micromolar binding affinities. Oligosaccharideswere distinguished based on their building blocks glycosidic linkages and chain length. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop synthetic glycosidases withselectivities unavailable in their natural counterparts. The proposed catalysts containsubstrate-specific active sites with precisely installed catalytic groups for optimal catalysis.In the traditional synthesis of receptors and supramolecular catalysts tremendous syntheticefforts are needed just to have a binding pocket. Fine tuning of the pocket for specific andcomplex biomolecules is nearly impossible. The micellar imprinting technology used in theMINP preparation on the other hand can quickly construct multifunctionalized complex-shaped active sites from simple building blocks.

Because RGCs are post-mitotic neurons their loss is permanent and causes a gradualdecline leading toward irreversible blindness. Unfortunately glaucoma manifests in a way that damages USsociety more broadlyit disproportionately affects certain racial groups. Glaucoma is a worse problemamongst African Americans than Caucasians. Though socioeconomic factors often contribute to this disparitya large part is biological and driven by genomic differences between racial groups. A recent breakthroughpoints to APBB2 as central to glaucoma in African Americans. A large genome-wide association study (GWAS)has found a single nucleotide polymorphism in APBB2 (rs59892895) with genome-wide significance (P=2x10-8;Odds ratio=1.33) and successfully replicated the finding in additional cohorts. identified a variant in the APBB2gene as an important cause of glaucoma in people of African descent. ABPP2 encodes a cytoplasmic adaptorprotein with multiple protein-protein interaction domains. Remarkably the high-risk allele is present inapproximately 21% of African Americans and apparently absent from Caucasians. Our team has contributed tothis discovery of APBB2 as a gene of importance to glaucoma in African Americans and as additionally shownin our Preliminary Data have developed a hypothesis that overexpression of APBB2 is the disease-causingmechanism. To test this new hypothesis we recently generated and now have in hand a mouse model on apure C57BL/6J genetic background that is overexpressing Apbb2. The strain was created by the University ofIowa Genome Editing Facility and features a full-length mouse Apbb2 (transcript variant 1) under control of aubiquitous promotor (CAG) and includes a 6His/3XFlag attached to the N-terminus (abbreviated as B6-Tg(Apbb2). The experiments of this proposal utilize this new strain as a central resource to complete theimportant but somewhat high risk test via manipulation that over-expression of Apbb2 promotes glaucoma. InSpecific Aim 1 we propose to test the anatomical and physiological consequences over time of Apbb2overexpression in mice. This Aim will also complete a thorough characterization of the B6-Tg(Apbb2) strain.Specific Aim 2 will study APBB2 from a molecular perspective identifying retinal APBB2 binding partners thatwill guide future mechanistic and candidate-driven genetic experiments.","APLP1 gene;APLP2 gene;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Affect;Affinity Chromatography;African;African American;Age;Aging;Alleles;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amyloid beta-Protein;Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor;Anatomy;Asians;Axon;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological;Blindness;Brain;Caucasians;Complex;Data;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Eye;Family;Functional disorder;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Variation;Genetic study;Genomics;Glaucoma;Hand;Heritability;Histologic;Human;Inner Plexiform Layer;Iowa;Length;Magnetism;Metabolic Pathway;Minor;Mitotic;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Odds Ratio;Optic Nerve;Pathogenesis;Patients;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Physiological;Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis;Population;Prevalence;Primary Open Angle Glaucoma;Process;Protein Binding Domain;Proteins;Race;Recording of previous events;Resources;Retina;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Silver Staining;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Societies;Socioeconomic Factors;Spectrophotometry;TBK1 gene;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Time;Transcript;Transgenic Mice;Universities;Variant;Western Blotting;abeta deposition;abeta toxicity;age group;age related neurodegeneration;base;cohort;experimental study;ganglion cell;genetic risk factor;genome editing;genome wide association study;genome-wide;high intraocular pressure;high risk;improved;member;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;overexpression;patient population;promoter;public health relevance;risk variant;therapeutic target;therapy resistant;tool","Mechanism of APBB2 contributions to glaucoma","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:Glaucoma is a common group of age-related neurodegenerative diseases characterized by loss of retinalganglion cells and their axons that carry information from the eye to the brain.

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYThis proposal is a competitive renewal for a unique study that measures the volume function anddevelopment of striatal-cerebellar circuity in children at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD). The standardassumption is that HD is a degenerative disease of the striatum. However research supports supported thenotion that a crucial component of the pathoetiology of HD is abnormal brain development. The grant wasoriginally funded in 2009 and dubbed the Kids-HD program designed to investigate this hypothesis by thestudy of children at risk for HD (those with a parent or grandparent with HD). The at-risk participants aregenotyped and those who are gene-expanded (GE) are compared to those who are gene non-expanded(GNE).Gene knock-down therapy  Antisense Oligonucleotides or ASOs  are currently entering Phase III studies andhold promise for treatment of patients in early stages of disease (by preventing further decline). If ASOs fulfillthat promise the next step will be preventive therapy  giving the ASO early enough (potentially to children) toprevent symptoms from occurring. The growth and development of the striatum is vital to understand as this isthe primary site of disease pathology. Yet knocking down a gene that is vital to development of thesestructures must be approached with an abundance of caution. Human brain development is prolonged withstriatal maturational changes occurring up through 30 years of age. Therefore discriminating ongoingdevelopment/maturation with the degenerative phase of the disease may be key in knowing when to administerand ASO. Our preliminary data suggest that a novel blood biomarker  Neurofilament light (NfL) rises withinroughly 20 years of onset but is normal prior to that suggesting it is not present in development but is seen atthe very beginning phases of degeneration.Rationale for renewal and expansion (5 sites across the US) include: 1) increase sample size for replication oforiginal findings with sufficient power to detect CAG-specific effects and 2) model the entire period of braindevelopment (up to age 30 rather than only up to age 18); 3) evaluate the utility of a blood biomarker of neuraldysfunction Neurofilament light (NFl) that may help delineate the earliest phases of degeneration.","Age;Age-Years;Antisense Oligonucleotide Therapy;Behavioral;Biological Markers;Blood;Brain;CAG repeat;California;Cerebellum;Child;Childhood;Cognition;Cognitive;Corpus striatum structure;DNA;Data;Degenerative Disorder;Development;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disadvantaged;Disease;Funding;Genes;Genotype;Globus Pallidus;Grant;Growth and Development function;Human;Huntington Disease;Huntington gene;Hypertrophy;Iowa;Length;Light;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Modeling;Motor;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuronal Dysfunction;Parents;Participant;Pathology;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Pennsylvania;Phase;Philadelphia;Preventive therapy;Process;Puberty;Research Support;Rest;Risk;Sample Size;Sampling;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Site;Structure;Study Subject;Symptoms;Texas;Trinucleotide Repeats;Universities;brain abnormalities;cognitive development;design;early childhood;frontal lobe function;grandparent;knock-down;longitudinal design;mutant;neurofilament;novel;phase 3 study;prevent;programs;putamen","Growth and development of Striatal-Cerebellum circuitry in subjects at risk for Huntingtons Disease","NARRATIVEThis proposal is a competitive renewal for a unique study that measures the volume function anddevelopment of striatal-cerebellar circuity in subjects at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD).

"Anxiety Disorders; Back Pain; Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Complementary and Integrative Health; Health Services; Mental Health; Pain Research; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Women's Health","ABSTRACTThe prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among U.S. adults is estimated at 20% with 50-80% of peoplereporting a significant episode at some point in their life and 23% of LBP patients reporting pain of highintensity with disability. The greatest burden placed on society occurs when LBP becomes chronic (cLBP).Inadequately managed chronic pain results in greater loss of productivity; increased expenditures forhospitalization surgery and medications; and costly out-of-pocket patient expenses. Given their high rates ofmusculoskeletal disease cLBP-related disability is rampant within our nation's Veteran population. Thecombination of cLBP and high medication use negatively impacts Veterans' work productivity and quality of lifeand generates substantial risk for long-term disability and opioid addiction. There is arguably no moreimportant population than Veterans for performing research to evaluate effective non-pharmacologicaltreatments that are safe pain relieving cost-effective and contain promise to restore function and quality oflife. One such option is chiropractic care. Several key factors support the need to deepen the study ofchiropractic care within the Veteran population: 1) biological models offer strong support for plausibility; 2)sufficient strength of evidence in systematic reviews has garnered a recommendation by American College ofPhysicians for spinal manipulation and/or chiropractic care targeting cLBP and 3) since beginning in 2004 theVeterans Health Administration (VA) has successfully integrated 115 doctors of chiropractic into ambulatorycare settings. These advances in chiropractic care integration have occurred despite substantial knowledgegaps particularly within VA. Specifically studies examining the delivery of chiropractic interventions have beenhighly variable and there is no optimal dosing in terms of treatment duration or number of visits. Thus theproposed study of Veterans age 18 and older with a diagnosis of cLBP is highly significant. Demonstrationproject investigators will work closely with the NIH-DOD-VA Collaboratory to accomplish the following projectAims: 1) Plan and develop the pragmatic research infrastructure needed to deliver a rigorous multi-siterandomized controlled trial within the VA addressing 15 milestones in four categories of activities; 2) Evaluatethe comparative effectiveness of a low dose (1-5 visits) of standard chiropractic care against a higher dose (8-12 visits) in Veterans with cLBP; 3) Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of chiropractic chronic painmanagement (CCPM) compared to usual care following the initial treatment described in Aim 1; 4) Evaluatethe impact of CCPM on health services outcomes compared to usual care; 5) Evaluate patient and clinicianperceptions of non-specific treatment factors effectiveness of study interventions and impact of the varyingdoses of standard chiropractic care and the CCPM on clinical outcomes across 3 VA facilities using a mixedmethod process evaluation approach.","Address;Adult;Age;Alcohol consumption;Ambulatory Care;American College of Physicians;Anxiety;Biological Models;Caring;Categories;Chronic;Client satisfaction;Clinical;Diagnosis;Doctor of Chiropractic;Dose;Drug Prescriptions;Effectiveness;Evaluation;Expenditure;Health;Health Services;Hospitalization;Infrastructure;Injections;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Knowledge;Life;Low Back Pain;Low Prevalence;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Methods;Modification;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Operative Surgical Procedures;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Outcome;Pain;Pain intensity;Pain interference;Participant;Patients;Pattern;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physical therapy;Policies;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Preparation;Process;Productivity;Provider;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Risk;Schedule;Services;Site;Societies;Spinal Manipulation;System;Treatment Factor;Uncertainty;United States National Institutes of Health;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;Visit;Woman;Work;chiropracty;chronic pain;chronic pain management;collaboratory;comorbidity;comparative effectiveness;cost;cost effective;design;disability;effectiveness study;evidence base;functional outcomes;functional restoration;health service use;military veteran;multimodality;outcome prediction;pain outcome;pain patient;pain relief;primary endpoint;primary outcome;productivity loss;randomized trial;secondary outcome;systematic review;treatment arm;treatment as usual;treatment duration;treatment group","Chiropractic Care for Veterans: A Pragmatic Randomized Trial Addressing Dose Effects for cLBP","PROJECT NARRATIVEThere is a pressing need to address the devastating impact of cLBP in Veteran populations. Prior researchindicates that chiropractic care increasingly integrated into the VHA system may have a positive impact.However chiropractic care has not been studied in the Veterans. In addition considerable uncertainty existsregarding optimal patterns of chiropractic use. The short-term pain and functional outcomes associated withvarying numbers of initial visits and the long-term effectiveness of chiropractic care within the context of real-world delivery at VHAs in terms of clinical impact is unknown. In addition we know very little regardingoutcomes resulting from the broader range of evidence-based chiropractic care strategies most commonlypracticed in real world settings. Thus the proposed demonstration project - an appropriately powered multisiteRCT specifically designed to rigorously address both of these issues - is highly significant and has the potentialto directly impact chiropractic utilization policy within the VHA and beyond regardless of outcome.","NCCIH","10248442","8/23/2021","RFA-AT-17-001","5UH3AT009761-05","5","UH3","AT","009761","05","","MURRAY, PETER DANIEL","9/20/2017","8/31/2023","ZAT1-VS(05)"," ","1947045","LONG, CYNTHIA R","GOERTZ, CHRISTINE MARIE","01","NONE","075845834","NJ24BM8CYWZ3","075845834","NJ24BM8CYWZ3","US","41.529376","-90.574829","1648601","PALMER COLLEGE OF CHIROPRACTIC","DAVENPORT","IA","SCHOOLS OF CHIROPRACTIC","528035214","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","8/31/2022"," ","213","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","1585301"," ","NCCIH","1324934","260367"," ","1585301",
"Arthritis; Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Fibromyalgia; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Women's Health","Project SummaryFibromyalgia (FM) is a complex condition characterized by widespread pain and fatigue that is associated withsleep dysfunction and reduced function that affects 2-4% of the population (Heidari et al. 2017). Current 2016diagnostic criteria are by symptomology only as there are no validated chronic pain biomarkers to assist withdiagnosis or treatment evaluation endpoints (Wolfe et al. 2016). Diagnosing FM often takes years withpatients seeing multiple physicians which delays treatment (Choy 2010). This delayed diagnosis andtreatment initiation would be dramatically reduced with the identification of FM biomarkers. The long-term goalof this line of research is to identify unique biomarkers for FM to improve the diagnosis and/or developtherapeutic targets for individuals with widespread pain. Using a semi-targeted metabolomics approach ourpreliminary data from women with FM (n=59) compared to healthy controls (n=38) show 18 potentialcandidates that differ significantly between cohorts with several metabolites showing good-excellent sensitivity(>90%) and specificity (>90%). The primary goal of this proposed research is to assess and validatecandidate metabolic biomarkers in a new larger cohort of individuals and compared to other chronic painpopulations. The proposed study will use a multi-site cross-sectional design to identify and characterizemetabolic biomarkers biosignatures and their associations with multiple symptomology domains to addressthe following two specific aims: Aim 1: We will characterize diagnostic test metrics for candidate biomarkersusing receiver operating curves (ROCs) i.e. sensitivity and specificity and test-retest reliability to correctlyidentify individuals with FM from healthy controls and other chronic pain conditions: osteoarthritis carpal tunnelsyndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. Aim 2: We will determine associations between putative metabolicbiomarkers and multiple self-reported symptom domains in those with FM: a) pain; b) fatigue; c) sleep; d)physical function; e) psychological factors and f) disease impact/disability. We have identified severalpromising metabolic biomarkers that may serve as diagnostic or within-disease phenotype identifiers. Oncecompleted we will examine potential mechanistic and therapeutic targets for the candidate biomarkers insubsequent studies.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Infant Mortality; Lung; Neonatal Respiratory Distress; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","Project SummaryUp to 95% of premature infants undergo red blood cell (RBC) transfusion while in the intensive care unit yet itis unknown whether more restrictive or more liberal transfusions will lead to optimal brain development. TheTransfusion of Prematures (TOP) Trial is a multi-center study funded by the NHLBI and supported by theNICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN). The primary objective of the TOP Trial is to assess survival andrates of neurodevelopmental impairment at 22-26 months corrected age in extremely low birth weight (ELBW)infants that are randomized to either liberal or restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds. The trial beganenrollment in December 2012 and reached the target sample size of 1824 infants on time in April 2017.Although major deficits in motor and cognitive function may be detected at 22-26 months of age these infantsare too young to assess cognitive behavioral and coordination skills that if impaired can lead to problemswith academic skills motor performance or adaptive functioning in home or school environments conditionsthat are far more prevalent in this population and create substantial morbidity for the children and their families.Because optimal transfusion management is a critical knowledge gap in neonatology the currently proposedTOP 5 Study will assess functional neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants randomized to two differenttransfusion thresholds in the TOP Trial at 5 years corrected age.The TOP 5 Study Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) is led by Co-PIs Dr. Peg Nopoulos who has a ten-yearhistory of studying the outcomes of premature infants exposed to liberal or restrictive transfusion and Dr. SaraDeMauro who has extensive experience conducting multicenter outcomes studies in collaboration with theNICHD NRN and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at RTI International. The DCC PI Dr. Abhik Das alsoleads the DCC for the NICHD NRN. The NRN has a superb track record in school-age outcomes research andhistory of productive collaboration with NHLBI. Thus the TOP 5 Study has been thoughtfully designed toleverage existing successful research infrastructure relationships and resources in order to reduceredundancy and ensure success. The results of the TOP 5 study will provide evidence about whichapproach to neonatal transfusion (liberal or restrictive) minimizes damage to vulnerable neuronalcircuits and in turn which transfusion strategy will improve both short and long-term outcomes forthese vulnerable premature infants.","5 year old;Academic skills;Age;Age-Months;Assessment tool;Behavioral;Brain;Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia;Budgets;Cessation of life;Child;Child Development;Classification;Clinical;Clinical Management;Cognition;Cognitive;Collaborations;Data Coordinating Center;Development;Emotional;Enrollment;Ensure;Environment;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Exposure to;Extremely Low Birth Weight Infant;Family;Funding;Future;Home;Hydrocortisone;Impairment;Infant;Intensive Care Units;International;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Measures;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;Motor;Motor Skills;Movement;Multicenter Neonatal Research Network;Multicenter Studies;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Neonatal;Neonatology;Network Infrastructure;Neurodevelopmental Impairment;Neurological outcome;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Outcome Study;Outcomes Research;Packed Red Blood Cell Transfusion;Pediatric Hospitals;Performance;Philadelphia;Population;Premature Infant;Randomized;Readiness;Recording of previous events;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Sample Size;School-Age Population;Schools;Survival Rate;System;Testing;Time;Transfusion;Universities;Work;academic preparation;cognitive function;cognitive skill;cohort;design;experience;follow-up;functional disability;functional outcomes;improved;infant outcome;innovation;neuronal circuitry;phonology;premature;primary outcome;randomized trial;respiratory;skills;success","Transfusion of Prematurity Early School Age Follow-up (TOP 5) CCC","Project NarrativeThe Transfusion of Prematures (TOP) Trial randomized 1824 preterm infants to liberal or restrictive red bloodcell transfusions in order to determine which practice might be best for neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2years.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/AbstractDetection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria from rawretail meat and seafood in Iowa: A NARMS Retail Food Surveillance Project Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major health threat affecting the well-being ofhumans animals and the environment worldwide. Robust and comprehensive surveillancesystems emphasizing the One Health approach are necessary for effectively combatting AMR.In the United States the retail arm of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System(NARMS) under the Food and Drug Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA-CVM) performs surveillance of AMR in select enteric bacteria (non-typhoidal SalmonellaCampylobacter Enterococcus and Escherichia coli) from retail raw meats (chicken groundturkey and beef and ground/chop pork) in 18 states. Recently surveillance of AMR in retailseafood (tilapia shrimp salmon) for select bacteria (Vibrio Aeromonas E. coli Enterococcuscarbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaciae) has also been started in at least 8 states. TheNARMS program has contributed significantly to monitoring the sources and trends of AMR inthe food chain. To enhance the effort on combating AMR FDA launched a cooperativeagreement program to expand the NARMS surveillance network throughout the U.S in 2016.Under the initiative Iowa State University (ISU) became a NARMS network laboratory in late2016. Since then the ISU site has contributed substantially to strengthening the capacity andeffectiveness of the national AMR surveillance program in retail food. In this application wepropose to continue the collaborative partnership with NARMS to address the updated goals ofthe Retail Food Surveillance Program as described in FOA PAR-20-124 NARMS CooperativeAgreement Program to Strengthen Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance in Retail FoodSpecimens. Specifically we will continue to collect and process raw meat samples and seafoodsamples from grocery stores in Iowa and culture them for isolation of bacteria of interest asdefined by NARMS and ship the isolates to FDA on a monthly basis. In addition we willcontinue to perform whole-genome sequencing of Salmonella Campylobacter and E. coliisolates from the meat samples and share the sequences with FDA via GenomeTrakr. Thisapplication is built on existing experience and is a natural extension of our current effort withNARMS. Trained personnel and logistic infrastructure required for successful completion of theplanned work are already in place. We strongly believe that ISUs continued participation in thiscollaborative network will contribute significantly to mitigation of AMR in the food chain andultimately to enhancement of food safety and public health."," ","Detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria from raw retail meat and seafood in Iowa: A NARMS Retail Food Surveillance Project","Project NarrativeAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant public health concern.

"Infectious Diseases","Cell division in bacteria requires the concerted action of a large number of proteins that form a complex calledthe septal ring. Major challenges for the future include identifying all of these proteins and determining whatthey do on a biochemical level. Our long-term goal is to identify and characterize previously overlookedbacterial proteins that are important for cell division. Here we focus on a new class of cell division proteins thatcontain a SPOR domain. SPOR domains are found in over 3000 proteins from over 1000 bacterial speciesincluding many serious pathogens. SPOR domains bind septal peptidoglycan (PG) and thereby target manydivision proteins to the division septum. The specific form of PG to which SPOR domains bind is a denudedglycan a region of the amino sugar backbone of PG devoid of peptide side-chains. This unusual targetingmechanism sets SPOR domain proteins apart from the many septal ring proteins that localize via protein-protein interactions. This study will use four Escherichia coli SPOR domain proteins (DamX DedD FtsN andRlpA) to test two interrelated hypotheses: (a) different SPOR domains bind denuded glycans differently and(b) these differences are physiologically important. In Aim 1 biolayer interferometry (BLI) and isothermaltitration calorimetry (ITC) will be used to determine the affinity of SPOR domains for denuded glycans and thefeatures of the glycan that are important for binding. In addition NMR will be used to determine the firststructure of a SPOR domain in complex with a PG ligand. In Aim 2 the four E. coli SPOR domain proteins willbe examined in vivo using sophisticated single-molecule microscopy methods. Objectives of this aim includeascertaining whether different SPOR domain proteins localize to different sites at the septum and developing amore detailed picture of the overall architecture of the septal ring. Aim 3 will focus on the structure and functionof DamX using domain swapping and deletion analysis to identify important domains in that protein ascribethose domains to specific functions and determine whether SPOR domains are functionally interchangeable.These experiments will connect the biochemistry and microscopy in Aims 1 & 2 to the actual function of SPORdomain proteins during cell division. Particular effort will be devoted to understanding the mechanism by whichDamX inhibits cell division because this is an unusual activity for a septal ring protein and may be relevant topathogenesis by E. coli that infect the bladder.","Address;Affinity;Amino Sugars;Antibiotics;Architecture;Bacteria;Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance;Bacterial Infections;Bacterial Proteins;Binding;Binding Proteins;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Biological Assay;Bladder;Calorimetry;Cell Separation;Cell Wall;Cell division;Cells;Complex;Dissection;Escherichia coli;Family;Filament;Fluorescence Microscopy;Future;Goals;Health;Human;In Vitro;Interferometry;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Lytic;Methods;Microscopy;N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine Amidase;Organism;Pathogenesis;Peptides;Peptidoglycan;Phagocytosis;Physiological;Play;Polysaccharides;Process;Proteins;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Reporting;Role;Side;Site;Specificity;Structure;Techniques;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Titrations;Uropathogenic E. coli;Vertebral column;Virulence;Work;amidase;base;daughter cell;deletion analysis;experimental study;follow-up;in vivo;insight;novel strategies;pathogen;preference;protein degradation;protein protein interaction;single molecule;small molecule inhibitor;stem","Peptidoglycan binding protein specificity and bacterial cell division","NARRATIVEThe rapid emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a huge and urgent threat to humanhealth.

"Nutrition","Project SummaryDisruption of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulumER stressis associated with many differentmetabolic diseases particularly those associated with obesity that affect between 22 and 30 percent of adultsin the U.S. Because of this exceptional disease burden it is important to understand the factors that cause ERstress during metabolic dysregulation. Yet the pathways by which metabolic activity and ER homeostasis arecoupled are poorly understood. Mitochondria are central to metabolism and the TCA cycle is the hub of this activity accepting substratesfrom glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation for catabolism generating reducing equivalents for electron transportand for the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and providing building materials for the reductivebiosynthesis of lipids glucose and amino acids. Because of its centrality to so many processes flux throughthe TCA cycle is likely to affect many diverse cellular pathways even those with no obvious direct connection.This includes ER protein processing which is sensitive to changes in redox state amino acid availability andcellular lipid content. In this proposal we provide evidence for a previously unknown functional relationship between TCA cycleactivity and ER homeostasis in metabolically active cells including hepatocytes myocytes and adipocytesthat depends on production of NADPH by the TCA cycle and redox regulation of glutathione. This proposal isdesigned to identify the basic mechanisms linking TCA-dependent NADPH production in the mitochondria tohomeostasis in the ER. Toward that end we propose three specific aims: (1) Determine how NADPHproduction and compartmentalization link nutrient flow to ER stress; (2) Determine how changes tomitochondrial and cytosolic glutathione redox promote ER oxidation; and (3) Determine how TCA activity andglutathione redox alter ER function. We will achieve these aims using a combination of genetic andpharmacological tools to manipulate TCA cycle activity; cutting-edge biosensors to monitor changes in cellularredox status; manipulation and analysis of ER-mitochondrial contacts; and molecular biology approaches tomanipulate and assess ER functionality. The outcome of this work will be a mechanistic understanding of howmetabolic activity alters ER function to contribute to disease.","Acetyl Coenzyme A;Adipocytes;Adult;Affect;Amino Acids;Atherosclerosis;Biosensor;Catabolism;Cells;Citric Acid Cycle;Client;Communication;Coupled;Cytosol;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Electron Transport;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Enzymes;Genetic;Glucose;Glutathione;Glutathione Disulfide;Glutathione Reductase;Glycolysis;Goals;Hepatocyte;Homeostasis;Human;Isocitrate Dehydrogenase;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Lipids;Maintenance;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Molecular Chaperones;Monitor;Muscle Cells;NADP;Nutrient;Nutritional;Obesity;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Process;Production;Proteins;Pyruvate;Quality Control;Regulation;Steatohepatitis;Stress;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Testing;Time;Work;base;building materials;burden of illness;cell type;cofactor;comorbidity;design;endoplasmic reticulum stress;fatty acid oxidation;genetic manipulation;improved;insight;knock-down;lipid biosynthesis;malic enzyme;novel;oxidation;prevent;protein folding;pyruvate carrier;response;tool","Regulation of ER homeostasis by TCA cycle activity: mechanisms and consequences","Project NarrativeEndoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with many different human metabolic diseases includingdiabetes atherosclerosis steatohepatitis and others but the pathways connecting metabolic activity to ERstress are poorly understood.

"Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Contraception/Reproduction; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Maternal Health; Maternal Morbidity and Mortality; Pregnancy; Women's Health","Project Summary/Abstract Otherwise healthy women who develop preeclampsia during pregnancy are at a significantly (2-4 times)greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality; however the mechanism(s) responsiblefor this association remain unclear. One emerging hypothesis for this association is chronically elevatedinflammation and irreversible endothelial damage sustained during the preeclamptic pregnancy that persistpostpartum. In support of this hypothesis healthy women with a history of preeclampsia demonstrate elevatedinflammatory cytokines as well as increased vasoconstrictor sensitivity to angiotensin II (ang II) and attenuatedendothelium-dependent vasodilation. Further compelling data from rodent models suggest that potentiatedsignaling between ang II and inflammatory mediators contribute to severe vessel dysfunction during apreeclamptic pregnancy. Taken together these data suggest that chronic changes in ang II and inflammatorysignaling may lead to a pro-constrictor milieu in which attenuated endothelium-dependent vasodilationreduced nitric oxide bioavailability and exaggerated vasoconstriction result in persistent vessel dysfunction inwomen who have had preeclampsia. However few if any in vivo studies have sought to investigate thesemechanisms in humans. Using an innovative translational human approach that combines 1) in vivo pharmaco-dissection of mechanisms of vascular dysfunction 2) in vitro measures of immune cell activity and 3) bothacute and chronic pharmacological treatments the overarching goal of the proposed studies is acomprehensive mechanistic examination of aberrant ang II signaling and chronic inflammation - including novelinterventional pathways - in otherwise healthy women who have had preeclampsia. In specific aim 1 we will define the mechanistic role of ang II signaling in microvascular inflammation andassociated endothelial dysfunction in women who have had preeclampsia compared to control women whohave had a healthy pregnancy. In specific aim 2 we will define the mechanistic anti-inflammatory role ofangiotensin 1-7 (an endogenous inhibitor of ang II signaling). In specific aim 3 we will determine the effect ofsystemic ang II type 1 receptor inhibition (chronic oral losartan therapy) on in vivo and in vitro measures ofinflammation and endothelial function in women who have had preeclampsia. This comprehensive assessmentof mechanisms mediating persistent microvascular dysfunction and the identification of novel mechanisms bywhich to mitigate this dysfunction directly translates functional and molecular findings of cell and animalstudies to a clinical population and will lend insight into the management of chronic elevated CVD risk inwomen who have had preeclampsia.

"Brain Disorders; Endocrine Disruptors; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYExposure to the organochlorine dieldrin predisposes individuals to Parkinson's Disease (PD); however themechanisms linking exposure to disease and selective loss of dopaminergic cells are unknown. In additiondieldrin alone may be insufficient for loss of dopamine (DA) neurons and neurodegeneration may require anadditional hit such as from genetics. Several animal models have demonstrated that altering DA metabolismand/or trafficking yields progressive loss of DA neurons; therefore a genetic variation modifying DAmetabolism may be an additional hit that has toxic synergy with pesticide exposure. Cell types other than DAneurons are thought to be involved in PD such as glia and toxic factors released via glial activation arerealized as a critical contributors to disease progression. Both DA neurons and glial cells (e.g. astrocytes)metabolize DA and other neurotransmitters and generate toxic intermediates such as ROS and aldehydes(34-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde DOPAL) via monoamine oxidase. Based on literature precedent andpreliminary data we propose DA metabolism and trafficking as a mechanistic target for the pesticide dieldrinthat can produce a build-up of reactive and toxic intermediates such as DOPAL and neuroinflammation. Whilethe role of DA and its quinone have been explored as a mechanism for neurotoxicity very little is known aboutDOPAL and the role of aldehyde metabolism. DOPAL generation is proposed as a mechanism unifyingpesticide exposure neuroinflammation and loss of catecholaminergic cells. The goal of this work is to elucidatemechanisms underlying environmental risk factors for neurodegenerative disease specifically focusing on theinteraction of the pesticide dieldrin with DArgic and glia and resulting injury to dopaminergic neurons viareactive intermediates such as DOPAL. In addition the gene-environment interaction will be explored asdieldrin alone may be insufficient to cause loss of DA neurons. The central hypothesis is that pesticides suchas dieldrin target DA metabolism and/or trafficking in neurons and glia yielding reactive aldehyde metabolitesthat damage DA neurons and promote neuroinflammatory activation of glial cells. Three Aims will becompleted: 1) Determine the effects of pesticide exposure on the nigro-striatal DA system in transgenic micewith altered DA metabolism. 2) Determine the contribution of glial-derived reactive DA intermediates topesticide-mediated neuronal injury. 3) Identify cellular and molecular targets of reactive intermediates.

When tobacco control efforts fail early detection and treatmentof lung cancer offer the best hope for survival. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) enrolled 53454subjects who reported a cigarette history of at least 30 pack years and showed that LDCT screening prevented3 lung cancer deaths for every 1000 screened subjects a 16% risk reduction. However nearly 40% of LDCTsubjects had an abnormal scan with a false discovery rate of 97% placing many patients at risk for unnecessaryadditional radiation exposure and complications from invasive diagnostic procedures. The incorporation of DNA methylation assessments may improve the LDCT screening process byproviding a better estimate of who may benefit. In brief the current method for evaluating whether a patientneeds LDCT referred to as the PLCOM2012 mode uses the often-unreliable variable of self-reported cigaretteconsumption. However Behavioral Diagnostics has developed an epigenetic assay that objectively determinessmoking intensity. Using a similar yet less precise quantitative PCR assay Bojesen and colleagues studied2576 LDCT screening-eligible smokers in the Copenhagen City Study. They found that DNA methylation statusat cg05575921 strongly predicted which smokers would benefit from LDCT screening. Indeed in their studythis epigenetic marker of smoking outperformed the entire PLCOM2012 model in predicting cancer risk andshowed that over 20% of those who would normally qualify for LDCT screening had no prospect of benefittingfrom screening. In this R43 proposal we will measure cg05575921 methylation in 3200 subjects from the NLST and testwhether incorporating cg05575921 methylation status into the PLCOM2012 lung cancer risk model improvesprediction. We hypothesize that DNA methylation at cg05575921 will predict lung cancer occurrence and identifya population of smokers who are unlikely to benefit from LDCT screening. This project will have high commercialimpact because it may lead to a marked decrease in unnecessary screening. The team is highly qualified. It isled by the CEO of Behavioral Diagnostics who invented the assay and the company controls all necessary IP.He will be assisted by Dr. Jeff Long a biostatistician with an international reputation for conducting biomarkeranalyses and a team of pulmonologists ethicists and other scientists. It is innovative because epigeneticscreening is relatively new to cancer screening. It is feasible because the DNA and clinical information hasalready been collected. If successful the pathway to the R44 extension and eventually the clinic is clear-cutbecause the assay is already manufactured under GMP conditions the digital PCR platform is already 510Kapproved we have collaborators have experience with the FDA submission process and the economics drivingmarket adaption are already in place.","American;American College of Radiology Imaging Network;Automobile Driving;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biomedical Engineering;Biopsy;Blood;Businesses;Cessation of life;Cigarette;Cities;Clinic;Clinical;Consumption;DNA;DNA Methylation;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic radiologic examination;Early Diagnosis;Early treatment;Economics;Enrollment;Epigenetic Process;Ethicists;Goals;Health Expenditures;Intellectual Property;International;Lead;Lung;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Measures;Medical;Methods;Methylation;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Population;Process;Radiation exposure;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Regression Analysis;Reporting;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Reduction;Saliva;Sampling;Scanning;Scientist;Screening for cancer;Secondary to;Smoker;Smoking;Smoking History;Testing;arm;base;cancer risk;computed tomography screening;digital;epigenetic marker;experience;improved;innovation;low dose computed tomography;lung cancer screening;lung imaging;member;methylation testing;mortality;prevent;repository;risk prediction;screening;screening program;tobacco control","A DNA Methylation Test for Guiding Lung Cancer Screening","NarrativeThe purpose of this application is to determine whether a simple DNA methylation test can help determinewhether a smoker should undergo low dose CT screening for Lung Cancer and if this methylation test can helppredict risk for cancer.","NCI","10242473","8/18/2021","PA-20-260","1R43CA257372-01A1","1","R43","CA","257372","01","A1","WEBER, PATRICIA A","9/1/2021","8/31/2022","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 OTC-D (13)]"," ","1909930","PHILIBERT, ROBERT A","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","830528365","C8DQNL9C97V8","830528365","C8DQNL9C97V8","US","41.658053","-91.556331","10022867","BD HOLDING, INC.","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic For-Profits","522461932","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","8/31/2022"," ","394","SBIR/STTR","2021","395569"," ","NCI","278199","97370"," ","395569",
"Biotechnology; Genetics; Hematology; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Non-Human; Transplantation","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are rare cells within human bone marrow that are responsible both forthe life-long replenishment of all blood cell lineages and for the curative effects of bone marrow transplantation.The creation of human induced pluripotent stem cells holds great promise for cellular regeneration therapies butit is not currently possible to instruct these cells to generate HSCs in vitro. The goal of this application is todetermine how pro-inflammatory signaling via NF-kB instructs HSC fate in the vertebrate embryo and how thisprocess is regulated by Progranulin a (Pgrna) with the ultimate goal of replicating HSC generation in vitro forclinical utility. My working hypothesis is that early pro-inflammatory inputs converge to activate NF-kB which inturn activates key signaling events in the specification of HSC fate. These pro-inflammatory signals need to bedownregulated soon after HSC specification; my preliminary results suggest that Pgrna functions in this manner.To test these hypotheses this proposal consists of 2 aims: (1) Characterize the role of NF-kB in HSCspecification; and (2) identify the role of Pgrna in HSC emergence. This study will be conducted in zebrafishwhich are an ideal system for direct visualization of HSCs and have served as a model organism to study humandisease. To achieve this applications goals novel transgenic and mutant lines will be generated and qPCRFACS-sorting RNA-seq and confocal microscopy techniques will be utilized. Dr. Espin Palazon is a postdoctoral fellow in David Travers laboratory at UCSD whose ultimate careergoal is to lead an independent research group focused on stem cells at a major research institution. Her short-term goals are (1) to determine the spatiotemporal requirements of NF-kB within hemogenic endothelium andthe downstream genes regulated to specify HSCs; and (2) to elucidate how Pgrna governs HSC emergence.She was recruited to join Dr. Travers group because of her strong background in immunology and the zebrafishanimal model. The project outlined in this proposal will allow Dr. Espin Palazon to transition from a mentoredscientific position to an independent research career helping her gain expertise in FACS sorting RNA-seqgenome editing techniques and HSC biology all of which are fundamental to establish her independent lab.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease","Project SummaryHeart failure (HF) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States; each year 1million deaths and 250000 hospitalizations are directly attributed to HF. Cardiac fibrosis is a driver of heartfailure and valve disease. Clinically cardiac fibrosis is a strong predictor of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in HF.Both endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are able togenerate cardiac fibrosis in the adult heart which in turn predisposes individuals to HF cardiac arrhythmiasand SCD. While many pathways have been found to contribute to cardiac fibrosis inherited mutations causingfibrosis have not been readily identified.We have identified a family with a complex medical history characterized by extensive cardiac fibrosis andcardiac valve disease. We performed whole exome sequencing on affected members of this family andidentified a mutation in muscle segment homeobox 1 (MSX1-E135D) that was present in all members of thefamily with disease. MSX1 also known as HOX7 is a transcription factor and a transcriptional repressor in theheart. MSX1 participates in EndMT during cardiac development but remains poorly studied in the adult heart.The long-term objective of this application is to better understand the pathways and processes which underlieinherited cardiac fibrosis. The specific objective of this project is to understand the role of MSX1 in the adultheart and its contribution to cardiac fibrosis. We hypothesize that MSX1 regulates transcriptional repression ofgap junctions and EndMT in the adult heart and that the loss of this regulation leads to cardiac fibrosis inarrhythmias. We will test this hypothesis through two specific aims:1) Define the physiologic role of Msx1 in the adult heart. We will characterize the effect of Msx1 cardiac-specific deletion in the adult mouse heart by electrocardiography echocardiography cardiac MRI (cMRI)invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology studies and whole cell patch clamping of primary cardiomyocytesof Msx1 cardiac-specific knockout and littermate control mice.2) Define the molecular pathways by which Msx1 deletion causes cardiac dysfunction. We will test the functionof the MSX1-E135D mutation through luciferase assay of known genes repressed by MSX1. We will also testfor enhanced fibrosis in the hearts of our knockout mouse by immunohistochemistry for makers of fibroblastsand endothelial cells. Also we will use RNA- and ChIP-seq to define targets of Msx1 regulation in the heart.When successful these studies will implicate a new transcription factor in the development of cardiac fibrosisconduction disease and HF. Further understanding of the function of MSX1 and its associated pathways in theadult heart may lead to new targets for therapeutic intervention in cardiomyopathic and arrhythmogenicconditions supporting the Mission Goals and Objectives of the NHLBI.","Adult;Affect;Arrhythmia;Biological Assay;Bradyarrhythmias;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiac development;Cardiovascular system;Cells;Cessation of life;ChIP-seq;Clinical;Complex;Connexin 43;Connexins;Data;Disease;Dyes;Echocardiography;Ectopic Junctional Tachycardia;Electrocardiogram;Electrophysiology (science);Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Epithelial;Event;Exhibits;Family;Family member;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Fostering;Gap Junctions;Genes;Goals;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Injuries;Heart Valve Diseases;Heart failure;Homeobox;Hospitalization;Immunohistochemistry;In Vitro;Individual;Inherited;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Lead;Left ventricular non-compaction;Luciferases;MSX1 gene;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Medical Genetics;Medical History;Mesenchymal;Mission;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Muscle;Mutation;Myocardial dysfunction;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;Outcome;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiology;Process;Public Health;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA;Regulation;Reporting;Repression;Research;Role;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Transcription Repressor;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Western Blotting;Work;aortic valve disorder;chromatin immunoprecipitation;coronary fibrosis;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;exome sequencing;gene repression;genetic testing;heart function;histological studies;improved;innovation;insight;mortality;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;patch clamp;premature;sudden cardiac death;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing","Assessing the Impact of MSX1 in Cardiac Fibrosis and Sudden Cardiac Death","Project NarrativeThe proposed research aims at understanding the contribution of a regulator of cardiacdevelopment to cardiac fibrosis.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities; Minority Health","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTMicroneedles are a minimally invasive method for enhancing skin permeability through the creation ofmicropores in the epidermis. The micropores are aqueous pathways that allow an otherwise skin-impermeabledrug to pass through the skin and be delivered systemically. This has important implications for the treatmentof many diseases in diverse patient populations. Drug delivery parameters (drug formulation microneedlelength/number) and in vivo considerations (rate of closure of the micropores) both contribute to thepharmacokinetics and drug disposition. Despite extensive study of microneedles in humans there is a largepaucity of data describing how physiologic factors such as sex/gender and race/ethnicity affect the drugdelivery profile. Many significant differences are present in the skin of subjects of differing sex/gender andrace/ethnicity including variations in epidermal thickness reactivity and recovery from insult. Epidermalthickness also varies dramatically between different sites of the body. In order to achieve widespread use ofmicroneedles for drug delivery it is necessary to understand the variability in drug delivery profiles betweendiverse patient subgroups. The effect of physiologic factors on the drug delivery profile cannot be predictedfrom in vitro diffusion studies which makes it critical to study the in vitro and in vivo settings together. The long-term goal of this research is to develop advanced microneedle delivery platforms that will improvepharmacotherapy and treatment for diverse patient populations with a variety of acute and chronic diseases.The strategy of this 5 year MIRA research program is to make correlations between preclinical drug deliverystudies and clinical human microneedle studies by combining fundamental and applied research. In vitrostudies will aim to maximize percutaneous flux of macromolecules and small molecules by optimizingformulation and microneedle delivery parameters. We will study micropore closure rates and drug absorptionprofiles from numerous anatomical sites in healthy human volunteers of differing sex/gender and race/ethnicity.Microneedle length and number and drug formulation will be studied as additional factors that may contributeto in vivo variability. In the clinical studies we will calculate micropore closure half-lives under variousconditions and validate the predictions with pharmacokinetic studies. Correlations will be made between in vitropercutaneous flux studies and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies for each patient population. This MIRA programwill expand our understanding of how physiologic variables affect microneedle drug delivery in healthysubjects and in the future we will expand upon these results and perform micropore closure andpharmacokinetic studies in patients with systemic diseases. This will enable us to understand how diseasesfurther contribute to variation in response to microneedles. We then will have the necessary tools to optimizemicroneedle delivery in distinct patient subsets for treatment of disease.","Acute Disease;Affect;Anatomy;Applied Research;Biological;Chronic Disease;Clinical;Clinical Research;Data;Diffusion;Disease;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Formulations;Drug Kinetics;Epidermis;Ethnic Origin;Formulation;Future;Gender;Goals;Human;Human Volunteers;In Vitro;Knowledge;Length;Methods;Pathway interactions;Patients;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pharmacotherapy;Physiological;Race;Recovery;Research;Site;Skin;System;Systemic disease;Thick;Variant;absorption;aqueous;drug disposition;fundamental research;improved;in vivo;macromolecule;micropore;minimally invasive;patient population;patient subsets;pre-clinical;programs;response;sex;small molecule;tool","The effects of pharmacologic and physiologic variables on the pharmacokinetics of microneedle drug delivery","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis MIRA research program will investigate how the skin responds to microneedle drug delivery in patients ofdifferent sex/gender and race/ethnicity.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT ABSTRACTFalls are the leading cause of unintentional fatal and nonfatal injury among older adults in the United States. InIowa rates of fall-related deaths and hospitalizations among older adults are higher than the national average.More than one-third of older adults fall each year in the U.S. and many of these falls result in injury decreasedor permanent loss of functioning loss of independence and a fear of falling. We know that certain medicationsincluding those that affect the central nervous system (CNS) increase the risk of a fall among older adults andthat interventions targeting withdrawal of these medications reduce falls and fall-related injuries. We also knowthat reaching high-risk older adults including those living in rural communities with falls prevention programscan be challenging. On their own older adults do not typically engage in falls prevention behaviors and oftenreport that limited support from healthcare providers is a barrier to participation in falls prevention programs.The long-term goal of the proposed study is to develop a sustainable program for healthcare systems toreduce fatal and nonfatal falls among high-risk older adults living independently in their communities. Theobjective of the proposed study is to examine how a medication care plan grounded in establishedmedication de-prescribing and tapering frameworks can be implemented in primary care clinics to reducemedically-treated falls among older adults living in rural Iowa communities. The proposed study is acollaboration between researchers and clinical pharmacists at the University of Iowa and a clinical team fromthe Mercy Health Network Accountable Care Organization (ACO) which is a non-academic healthcare systemwith significant reach into rural Iowa communities.

"Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYRecently we discovered that a small molecule inhibitor of acetyl CoA synthetase (ACS) AR-12 has broadspectrum fungicidal activity in vitro and promising activity in vivo. Consistent with this broad spectrum of activitygenetic studies indicate that ACS is essential for viability in multiple fungi (C. albicans Fusarium S. cerevisiae).In contrast ACS is not essential in mammals. This is likely because in mammals and plants the vast majorityof acetyl CoA is derived from ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) and not ACS. The most important exception to this rule isthe cancer cell where ACS is the predominant source of acetyl CoA. Consequently ACS has emerged as ananti-cancer target. Although the development of AR-12 stalled we propose that its target ACS remains worthyof further exploration as the basis for a new class of antifungal drugs.To identify novel inhibitors of fungal ACSswe have developed a multi-disciplinary approach based on: 1) two complementary small molecule screeningstrategies; 2) the structural characterization ACS-inhibitor complexes from multiple pathogenic fungi: 3) wholecell assays of ACS function and inhibition and 4) medicinal chemistry strategies that have already yieldedmicromolar inhibitors of ACS. An STD-NMR screen with C. neoformans Acs1 and identified 492 ACS interactingmolecular fragments of which the vast majority also interacted with multiple fungal ACS enzymes. In Aim 1 wewill further characterize these hits. As a parallel strategy we adapted our ACS activity assay for high throughputscreening (HTS) with the goal of directly identifying small molecule ACS inhibitors. Our chemistry plan (Aim 2)is guided in part by the hypothesis that molecules mimicking the acetyl adenosine-monophosphate ester(AcAMP) intermediate are likely to be effective inhibitors. In Aim 2A we will characterize the acetyl-PO3 bindingpocket by a structure-activity study of AcAMP mimics derived from molecules already crystallized in the activesite of fungal ACSs. Biochemically stable potent acetyl-PO3 isosteres emerging from this analysis will then belinked with putative ATP/AMP-binding pocket-targeted fragments to assemble candidate non-nucleoside bi-substrate ACS inhibitors. To complement this hypothesis-based strategy candidate inhibitors will also beassembled from other strongly interacting fragments and we will optimize inhibitors directly identified in the ACSactivity-based HTS screen (Aims 2B&C). New molecules will be evaluated (Aim 3) with a testing funnel thatincludes biochemical characterization of ACS inhibition antifungal activity against a range of pathogenic fungiwhole cell assays of on-target activity against ACS and initial in vitro toxicity/ADME characterization. Our goalis to identify a lead ACS inhibitor scaffold along with a back-up series for further pre-clinical development asbroad-spectrum antifungal drug candidates.","ATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyase;Acetate-CoA Ligase;Acetyl Coenzyme A;Active Sites;Address;Adenosine Monophosphate;Affect;Anti-Infective Agents;Antifungal Agents;Aspergillosis;Azoles;Back;Bacterial Meningitis;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Candida;Candida albicans;Case Series;Cellular Assay;Chemistry;Clinical;Complement;Complex;Cryptococcal Meningitis;Cryptococcus;Cryptococcus neoformans;Crystallization;Development;Enzymes;Esters;Fusarium;Genetic study;Goals;Human;In Vitro;Industrial fungicide;Infection;Lead;Libraries;Life;Link;Mammals;Molds;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mycoses;Organ;Patients;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacopoeias;Plants;Polyenes;Roentgen Rays;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Series;Source;Structure;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;anti-cancer;base;cancer cell;design;drug candidate;fungus;high throughput screening;in vitro activity;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;interdisciplinary approach;mortality;nanomolar;novel;pathogen;pathogenic fungus;preclinical development;scaffold;screening;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor","Discovery and optimization of antifungal acetyl CoA synthetase inhibitors","PROJECT NARRATIVEFungal infections affect an estimated 300 million people annually causing considerable morbidity and mortalityaround the globe.

"Bipolar Disorder; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Serious Mental Illness","DISC1 (Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1) has emerged as a significant genetic risk factor for a widerange of mental illness such as schizophrenia bipolar disorders and depression. The product of DISC1 isa long scaffold protein that plays a critical role in several neuronal signaling pathways. Despite growingappreciation of its role in the etiology of mental disorders almost nothing is known about the structure ofDISC1 and its mechanisms of interaction and regulation. This research project will specifically focus on therole of DISC1 in the cAMP pathway. Reduced cAMP levels are found in patients suffering from majordepression and are associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Enzymes controlling intracellular levelsof cAMP such as the phosphodiesterase family PDE4 have considerable pharmaceutical importance forthe development of antidepressant and memory enhancing drugs. The overall goal of this project is toprovide a structural framework describing the role of DISC1 in the cAMP pathway and to understand howalterations in this pathway contribute to the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Aim 1 will provide a completestructural model of DISC1 including its mechanism of oligomerization and modulation by phosphorylation.We will also investigate the structural consequences of disease-associated mutations. We are proposinghere an integrative structural approach combining Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry(HDX-MS) solution NMR spectroscopy X-ray crystallography Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) andmolecular simulations to reconstitute the complete structural and dynamical features of DISC1. Ourpreliminary data demonstrate that we can characterize DISC1 N-terminal constructs by solution NMRspectroscopy while constructs encompassing the central and/or C-terminal domains are well suited for X-ray crystallography study. Aim 2 will combine biochemical and structural approaches to characterize theinteraction between DISC1 and ATF4 a major transcription factor the cAMP pathway controlling theexpression of the CRE-elements and of the phosphodiesterase PDE4D9. Our preliminary data show thatDISC1-ATF4 complex can be reconstituted in vitro with truncated constructs of both proteins. This aim willprovide a mechanistic framework for understanding the role of DISC1 as transcriptional co-repressor andthe function of DISC1-ATF4 complex in the cAMP pathway. Aim 3 will unravel the mechanisms of allostericinhibition of long and short PDE4 isoforms by DISC1 using a combination of biochemical structural andcomputational techniques. Overall completion of this project will provide a comprehensive unifyingframework for understanding the role of DISC1 in the cAMP pathway. Our work will also provide newstructural targets for the development of molecules regulating cAMP levels.","Affinity;Antidepressive Agents;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Bipolar Depression;Bipolar Disorder;C-terminal;Complex;Computational Technique;Computer Simulation;Cyclic AMP;DISC1 gene;DNA;DNA Sequence;Data;Deuterium;Development;Disease;Elements;Enzymes;Etiology;Family;Foundations;Functional disorder;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hydrogen;In Vitro;Individual;Length;Major Depressive Disorder;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Memory;Mental disorders;Molecular;Mutation;N-terminal;NMR Spectroscopy;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Nuclear;PDE4B;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Phosphorylation;Play;Positioning Attribute;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Predisposing Factor;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Research Project Grants;Roentgen Rays;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Schizophrenia;Shapes;Signal Pathway;Structural Models;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Ulysses Contracts;Variant;Work;X-Ray Crystallography;base;dimer;drug discovery;experimental study;genetic corepressor;genetic risk factor;genomic locus;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;member;molecular dynamics;nervous system disorder;neurotransmission;novel therapeutic intervention;phosphoric diester hydrolase;reconstitution;simulation;transcription factor","Structure and function of DISC1 in the cAMP pathway","Alterations in DISC1 a key regulator of a large network of enzymes in the central nervous systemare associated with schizophrenia bipolar disorders and depression.

Many deficits cannot be reliably detected until years after surgery makingneurologic outcomes difficult to predict and creating a critical need for an early biomarker. The long term goalof this application is to improve the diagnosis and management of brain injury in CHD by identifying serum bi-omarkers for neurodevelopmental outcomes that can facilitate clinical trials of neuroprotective strategies andhelp guide treatment. The specific objective is to use novel high-throughput transcriptomic and proteomic tech-nologies ex vivo and in vivo neuroimaging and innovative computational methods to characterize tau in normalhuman brain development and following hypoxic-ischemic injury due to CHD. Our hypothesis is that tau ex-pression splicing and phosphorylation change during development and in response to hypoxic-ischemic injuryleading to changes that can be detected in serum and used as biomarkers of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury.Our rationale is that understanding these changes will permit the use of tau as a serum biomarker of neonatalbrain injury thus improving outcomes for these patients. We plan to test our hypothesis by: (1) Characterizingtau splicing in human brain development and CHD using hybrid RNA sequencing (RNASeq/IsoSeq) and RNAusing in situ hybridization (BaseScope) (2) Characterizing tau post-translational modification in the same set-tings multiplex serial immunofluorescence (Opal) immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting and (3) validatingtau as a serum biomarker of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury using single molecule array (Simoa) ELISA in a dis-covery cohort of infants with CHD. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it appliesnovel methods including long-read RNA sequencing BaseScope high-resolution ex-vivo MRI and Simoa to aheretofore under-studied role of tau in human development and as a potential candidate biomarker in CHD.The proposed research is significant because it is the first step towards the development of clinically useful bi-omarkers for neurologic outcomes in congenital heart disease and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury in generalthus facilitating clinical trials and improving outcomes in these patients. At the same time the proposed projectis designed to provide critical career development training to the candidate. The proposal builds upon the can-didate's established interest in developmental neuropathology and his prior training in computational geneticsand translational research. The candidates primary mentor Dr. Alex Bassuk is an experienced clinician anddevelopmental neuroscientist and will be supplemented by co-mentors with specific expertise in translationalneuroscience (Dr. Abel) tau biology (Dr. Crary) and neuroradiology (Dr. Panigrahy).

Investigatorsin Project 3 have found that pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH-) is a promising adjuvant to chemo-radiationtherapy in GBM exploiting fundamental differences in oxidative metabolism. Preliminary data demonstrate theselective toxicity of P-AscH- to GBM cells relative to normal human astrocytes (NHA) occurs via H2O2-inducedoxidative stress mediated by redox active Fe ions. Furthermore in a pre-clinical GBM model as well as in aphase 1 clinical trial (NCT01752491) they found that P-AscH- (achieving ~20 mM [plasma]) + radiation andtemozolomide therapy was well-tolerated with minimal adverse events while showing encouraging therapeuticresponses. Finally preliminary data also support the idea that magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may becapable of detecting the redox state of Fe (i.e. Fe+2/Fe+3) for predicting responses to P-AscH- in combinationwith chemo-radiation therapy via assessing changes of T2* relaxometry. Currently there is no clear understanding of mechanisms causing the differential susceptibility of GBM vs.normal brain cells to P-AscH- in vivo. Project 3 will test the hypothesis that P-AscH- selectively increaseslabile redox active Fe associated H2O2 formation in human GBM cells relative to normal astrocytesleading to increased oxidative DNA damage and increased sensitivity of GBM cells to radiation andtemozolomide that can be assessed in vivo using MR imaging with T2* relaxometry and quantitativesusceptibility mapping.

Despite recentadvances 5-year survival has remained essentially unchanged for the last 40 years at 11-17% [2] andadditional approaches are urgently needed to improve outcomes. Pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH-; highdose intravenous vitamin C) has recently re-emerged as an agent that enhances cancer cell responses toradiation and chemotherapy in cell culture and in animal models. Preliminary data show selective toxicity aswell as chemo-radiosensitization of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) versus normal non-transformed bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) with P-AscH- treatment. However the mechanisms underlyingthe differential susceptibility of lung cancer vs. normal cells to P-AscH- are not known. Based on strong pre-clinical and clinical data from an ongoing clinical trial in NSCLC Project 2 will test the hypothesis that P-AscH-selectively sensitizes NSCLC cells to radiation and chemotherapy by increasing cancer cell steady-state levels of H2O2 as a result of specific disruptions in redox-active iron metabolism mediated byendogenous levels of O2-/H2O2. This hypothesis will be tested mechanistically in preclinical models in Aim 1as well as in a phase 1B/2 clinical trial in stage III inoperable lung cancer patients in Aim 2. Aim 1 willdetermine in vitro and in vivo if differential regulation of redox-active labile iron pools by O2- and H2O2 causesalterations in Fe metabolism (i.e. transferrin receptor ferritin Fe-S proteins) that mediate P-AscH--inducedradio-chemotherapy sensitization in NSCLC vs. normal lung epithelial cells.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Integrative Health; Digestive Diseases; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/Abstract - Project 1:Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the 4th leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. Metastasis is a majorcause of cancer mortality accounting for as many as 90% of cancer-related deaths. Although a goal ofcytotoxic therapies is to minimize metastatic tumor growth therapies specifically designed to inhibit themechanisms of invasion that drive metastasis are not currently utilized as a part of pancreatic cancertreatment. We believe that targeting invasion and metastasis of pancreatic tumors should be considered as animportant goal when treating pancreatic cancer even in the absence of detectable metastatic disease. Thisproposed research program will investigate the use of pharmacologic ascorbate (P-AscH- high-dose IVdelivery of vitamin C) in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Intravenous ascorbate but not oral ascorbateproduces high plasma concentrations which are in the range that are cytotoxic to tumor cells. Studies from ourgroup have demonstrated that ascorbate induces oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells;this cytotoxicity appears to be greater in tumor vs. normal cells. We have firmly established that P-AscH- is apro-drug for delivery of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumor cells. Recent clinical studies have demonstratedthat P-AscH- is safe and well tolerated. In addition patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer did not developmetastatic disease had reductions in metastases during treatment and increased median survival from 6months to 16 months. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by hypoxia is one of the criticalevents in pancreatic cancer metastases. HIF-1 mediates hypoxia responses and is overexpressed inpancreatic cancer. Stabilization and activation of HIF-1 triggers its target genes related to metastasis whichcorrelate with many difference cellular processes such as proliferation angiogenesis and EMT. The currentproposal will test the hypothesis that production of H2O2 mediates P-AscH--induced inhibition of metastaticdisease in human pancreatic cancer. We will test our hypothesis with the following three Specific Aims: 1)Determine if P-AscH- reduces metastatic disease by inhibiting the EMT process and tumor cell invasion via aH2O2-mediated mechanism; 2) Determine if decreased expression of H2O2-metabolizing enzymes (i.e.catalase) in metastatic PDAC cells mediates the increased sensitivity to P-AscH. 3) In a phase II trialdetermine efficacy of P-AscH combined with gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel as defined by an increase inprogression free survival and/or overall survival. Our proposal combines complimentary approaches todemonstrate that P-AscH- can be used successfully as an adjuvant to improve responses in the treatment ofpancreatic cancer. Furthermore we will investigate the mechanism by which P-AscH- inhibits metastaticdisease. If we can rigorously demonstrate that P-AscH- induces preferential oxidative stress and subsequentinhibition of metastatic disease in pancreatic cancer then the results of this proposed research program willprovide a foundation for the rational design of a combined modality cancer therapy.","Accounting;Adjuvant;Ascorbic Acid;Cancer Etiology;Cell Respiration;Cell physiology;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Data;Development;Disease;Distant;Dose;Enzymes;Event;Foundations;Generations;Genes;Glioblastoma;Goals;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Hypoxia;Image;In Vitro;Intravenous;Lesion;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mediating;Metabolism;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Modality;Neoplasm Metastasis;Normal Cell;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Paclitaxel;Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Ascorbate;Plasma;Process;Prodrugs;Production;Progression-Free Survivals;Research;Testing;Tumor Cell Invasion;angiogenesis;ascorbate;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;catalase;chemotherapy;combined cancer modality therapy;cytotoxic;cytotoxicity;design;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;gemcitabine;improved;in vivo;iron metabolism;metastatic process;mortality;neoplastic cell;novel;overexpression;oxidation;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell;pancreatic neoplasm;phase II trial;phase III trial;pre-clinical;predictive marker;programs;response;success;therapy outcome;tumor;tumor growth","Project 1: Inhibition of Metastasis Utilizing Pharmacological Ascorbate in Pancreas Cancer","Project Narrative - Project 1:Intravenous ascorbate produces high plasma concentrations in the range that is cytotoxic to pancreatic tumorcells.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/Abstract - Overall:This highly innovative research program will investigate the use of pharmacologic ascorbate (P-AscH-. high-dose IV delivery of vitamin C) in the treatment of cancer. Intravenous ascorbate but not oral ascorbateproduces high plasma concentrations (15-20 mM) which are in the range that are selectively cytotoxic tocancer cells. Studies from our highly integrated translational research team have demonstrated that P-AscH-selectively induces oxidative stress and cytotoxicity as well as radio-chemo-sensitization in pancreas lung andbrain cancer vs. normal cells. In parallel ongoing pancreas brain and lung cancer clinical trials within ourprogram P-AscH- has been shown to be safe and well-tolerated when combined with standard of care radio-chemo-therapies. We have firmly established in all our model systems that P-AscH- is a pro-drug for delivery ofhydrogen peroxide (H2O2). These results have led to the overarching hypothesis that aberrant cancer celloxidative metabolism dysregulates labile redox active metal ion pools enhancing P-AscH- oxidation to formH2O2. The overall theme of this Program Project application is that P-AscH- can be used as an easilyimplementable clinical adjuvant to conventional radio-chemo-therapies that will selectively target cancer vs.normal cells by increasing H2O2 formation. Furthermore this mechanism appears to be broadly applicable toseveral cancers. The current application applies these principles to highly integrated approaches mechanismsand biomarkers in the use of P-AscH- as an adjuvant in to the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC Project 1) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC Project 2) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM Project3). The Administrative Core (Core A) will coordinate all aspects of the project and bio-statistical analysis.

Successful completion of this proposed program projectwill demonstrate the feasibility of an easily implemented new paradigm in complementary approaches to redoxmetabolism-based cancer therapy utilizing P-AscH- that could provide the foundation for large scale phase 3multi-institutional cooperative group trials.

"Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Diabetes; Hypertension; Kidney Disease; Nutrition","Project Summary / AbstractHypertension in patients with Metabolic Syndrome incurs a large financial societal and health cost in theUnited States. Despite several lines of evidence that hypertension in the Metabolic Syndrome has a distinctcause from idiopathic (essential) hypertension this cause is not known and patients are treated empirically.Contributions from many labs over the last 30 years have supported the hypothesis that enhanced insulinsignaling in the kidney plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of this disease. The Applicant's preliminary dataconfirms the hypothesis that insulin action in the kidney contributes to hypertension in a mouse model ofMetabolic Syndrome and suggests that proximal tubular sodium transport may be increased expanding bloodvolume and increasing blood pressure. The Applicant has (1) characterized: a mouse model to study theintersection of the kidney blood pressure and Metabolic Syndrome and (2) generated a novel inducible tubuleinsulin receptor knockout mouse to study the contribution of insulin receptor signaling to sodium transport andblood pressure. In addition to the Applicant's contributions the mentoring and scientific environment make himan ideal candidate to develop independence in renal physiology research addressing this important question.Here the Applicant proposes three aims to study the contribution of insulin receptor signaling in the MetabolicSyndrome to acute pressure natriuresis (Aim 1) to regulators of proximal tubule sodium transporter activity inresponse to acute and chronic hypertension (Aim 2) and to patterns within the proximal tubule epithelial celltranscriptome generated by insulin receptor signaling the Metabolic Syndrome or both (Aim 3). Successfulcompletion of these aims will begin to bridge the gap in knowledge between the role of insulin in whole animalphysiology and transporter activity and regulation in individual cells. In addition through this trainingmechanism the Applicant will learn the skills to successfully conduct independent research in basic sciencenephrology.","Acute;Address;Affect;American;Animals;Apical;Area;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Blood;Blood Pressure;Blood Volume;Cells;Chronic;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Disease;Dose;Environment;Epithelial Cells;Essential Hypertension;Excretory function;Faculty;Feedback;Financial cost;Future;Genes;Glucose;Health;Health Care Costs;Hormones;Hyperinsulinism;Hypertension;Impairment;Individual;Infusion procedures;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;Insulin Resistance;Kidney;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Learning Skill;Measures;Medical;Mentors;Metabolic syndrome;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Mus;Natriuresis;Nephrology;Obesity;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Physicians;Physiology;Play;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Renal tubule structure;Research;Risk;Role;Scientist;Sodium;Surface;System;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Training;Tubular formation;United States;Wild Type Mouse;Work;Zucker Rats;career;insulin signaling;interest;kidney dysfunction;mouse model;novel;pressure;receptor expression;response;salt sensitive;sequencing platform;societal costs;tool;trafficking;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing","Contribution of Renal Tubule Insulin Receptor on Proximal Tubule Sodium Transport and Hypertension int he Metabolic Syndrome","Project NarrativeMillions of Americans have Metabolic Syndrome a disease closely related to diabetes which significantlyincreases the risk of developing high blood pressure.

CET has proposed a direct Phase II SBIR application to create more reproduciblehuman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and create methods for growing maintainingand authenticating iPSCs. A major challenge in iPSC manufacturing and subsequentdifferentiation is the emergence of genetic instability that result from non-random chromosomalmutations. Genetic instability results in clonal expansion of genetic variants that increasesiPSC heterogeneity. The experimental variables that promote genetic instability are not wellunderstood. Yet oncogene-dependent reprogramming and prolong cell culturing are clearlylinked to genetic instability. Moreover prior iPSC reprogramming methods adapted forpreclinical research have not been optimized to mitigate against the infectious inflammatoryneoplastic and genetic risks for cell therapy. Thus iPSC reprogramming should bestandardized to include non-integrating virus-free and oncogene-free methods which wouldoffer reproducible iPSC in adherent and suspension cells. This milestone would mitigateoncogenic and viral effects that could reduce genetic instability in iPSC manufacturing anddifferentiation. Further iPSC reproducibility and differentiation would improve if growth factorsdisplayed fully human posttranslational modification (PTM). While bacterial-manufacturedgrowth factors and non-human glycosylated peptides and proteins are ubiquitous in the stemcell field they exhibit differential bioactivity than their native human counterparts. Thus usinggrowth factors that lack a fully human PTM may amplify the genetic instability and distort cellphenotype of iPSC and differentiated cells particularly for multiple differentiation steps thatrequire multiple growth factors. CET is a biotechnology company with a diverse pipeline ofhuman somatic stem cells and a first-in-class non-integrating feeder-free virus-free andoncogene-free iPSC reprogramming approach that has been validated and published foradherent cells and suspension cells. Moreover CET is the sole source manufacturer of selectpostnatal stem cells. These capabilities allowed CET to obtain immortalized human postnatalstem cells designed for biologic bioprocessing of fully human PTM. Thus CET is poised todevelop iPSC and differentiated cells through manufacturing processes that mitigate geneticinstability.

Prior iPSC reprogramming methods adapted for preclinical research have not beenoptimized to mitigate against the infectious inflammatory and neoplastic risks for cell therapy.Thus iPSC reprogramming should be standardized to include non-integrating virus-free andoncogene-free methods and have the diversity to reprogram both adherent cells andsuspension cells. This milestone would mitigate oncogenic and viral effects that could skew thepredictability of drug screening and offer greater safety for cell therapy and less geneticinstability. Further there is a need to improve the reproducibility of iPSC reprogramming anddifferentiation protocols by using fully human growth factors rather than the current use ofbacterial-based growth factors. The focus of this proposal will be to develop a platform to createreproducible GLP and GMP-grade iPSC with an additional emphasis on neural differentiation.The biotechnology will be coupled with rigorous computational analyses of the geneticphenotypes of iPSC and neuroprogenitor cells.","NIGMS","10239237","7/30/2021","RFA-GM-19-001","5R44GM139403-02","5","R44","GM","139403","02","","LIU, CHRISTINA HUANG","8/15/2020","8/14/2022","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IMST-U(17)B]"," ","1912675","MOY, ALAN B","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","093806151","ST93TQ1AWLJ7","093806151","ST93TQ1AWLJ7","US","41.708954","-91.60643","4418201","CELLULAR ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES, INC","Coralville","IA","Domestic For-Profits","52241","UNITED STATES","N","8/15/2021","8/14/2022"," ","859","SBIR/STTR","2021","346021"," ","NIGMS","267510","66878"," ","346021",
"Bioengineering; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Human Genome; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","PROJECT SUMMARYStem cell based treatments are promising approaches for tooth repair restoration and replacement.However there is no available source of dental epithelial stem cells (DESCs) which is essential forthese approaches. Fortunately recent development in cell reprogramming technology has made itpossible to generate desired cell type from other available cell types by ectopic expression of only ahandful master transcription factors (MTFs). However experimental identification of MTFs is time-consuming and expensive. Hence a comprehensive identification of MTFs for DESCs is lacking andpresents a critical barrier for understanding molecular biology of DESCs and realization its therapeuticpotential. The objective of this application is to generate transcriptome (RNA-seq) and epigenome(H3K27ac ChIP-seq) profiles of DESCs and comprehensively identify MTFs of DESCs based on itsmolecular profiles. Our preliminary study shows that by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) wecan isolate DESCs from incisors of Sox2-GFP transgenic mouse in which GFP expression is driven byDESCs specific marker Sox2. In addition we developed a computational MTFs prediction methodtermed MTFinder (Master Transcription Factor-Finder) that incorporates both transcriptome andepigenome data into a Bayesian statistical model. In this project we will first define dynamictranscriptome and epigenome profiles of mouse DESCs and its progeny (Aim 1). And then apply ourrecently developed computational model MTFinder to comprehensively identify MTFs for mouseDESCs (Aim 2). At the completion of this project we will generate molecular profiles of mouse DESCs.This will significantly expand our understanding of transcriptional and epigenetics landscape of DESCs.We expect that a list of known and novel MTFs of DESCs will be identified. This provides foundation forfuture cell reprogramming research. Furthermore this project will validate the performance of MTFindercomputational method which can be applied to other cell types of interests.","Address;Adult;Animals;Bayesian Modeling;Cells;ChIP-seq;Computer Models;Computing Methodologies;Consumption;Data;Dental;Dental Libraries;Development;Ectopic Expression;Epigenetic Process;Epithelial;Fibroblasts;Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting;Foundations;Future;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hepatocyte;Human;Incisor;Lead;Life;Literature;Liver;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Pattern;Performance;Process;Protocols documentation;Research;Source;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tooth regeneration;Tooth structure;Transgenic Mice;Validation;base;cell type;embryonic stem cell;epigenome;epithelial stem cell;experimental study;in silico;induced pluripotent stem cell;interest;novel;repaired;restoration;self renewing cell;stem cell biomarkers;stem cell therapy;stem cells;transcription factor;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing","Identification of Master Transcription Factors of Dental Epithelial Stem Cell by Computational Method","NARRATIVEThe goal of this project is to make comprehensive molecular profiles dental epithelial stem cells(DESCs) and then based on these profiles to identify master transcription factors of DESCs.

"Cancer; Complementary and Integrative Health; Lung; Lung Cancer; Radiation Oncology; Women's Health","AbstractDr. Melissa Fath is currently 100% supported by the program project grant entitled Exploiting RedoxMetabolism Using Pharmacological Ascorbate (P-AscH) for Cancer Therapy (P01 CA217797). The theme ofthis P01 is exploiting cancer cell redox metabolism using pharmacological ascorbate (P-AscH-; high doseintravenous vitamin C) for improving cancer therapy. The P01 is composed of 3 major research projects and 3core facilities. The proposal is highly integrated and focused on preclinical translational and clinical studiesrelevant to the use of P-AscH in cancer therapy and Dr. Fath's research will impact all three of the researchprojects and two of the cores. This R50 application proposes 100 % salary support for Dr. Fath to support allthe projects and two cores in the P01 research program as well as any new research initiatives funded by NCIthat may arise from that work. The Unit Director of the current proposal Dr. Douglas Spitz is part of the multi-PI leadership team as well as the principle investigator on Project 2 Exploiting Labile Iron Pools for ImprovingNSCLC Therapy Using Pharmacological Ascorbate. Specifically Project 2 in the P01 will test the hypothesisthat P-AscH selectively sensitizes non-small cell lung cancers to radiation and chemotherapy by selectivelyincreasing cancer cell steady-state levels of H2O2 as a result of specific disruptions in redox-active ironmetabolism mediated by endogenous levels of O2.-/H2O2 . The Free Radical and Radiation Biology Program(FRRBP) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Iowa is an ideal scientific environmentfor this proposed research because of its historic roots in radiation biology as well as the free radical theory ofcancer in association with a strong Radiation Oncology Department. Dr. Spitz is the division director of FRRBPand Dr. Fath is an associate research scientist that has been an active collaborative member for over 10 years.Dr. Fath has considerable expertise in testing the involvement of free radicals thiol oxidation redox sensitivesignaling pathways and oxidative damage end-points in many studies exploiting manipulations of redoxmetabolism to repurpose drugs for cancer therapy. Her background and training in Clinical PharmacyMedicinal & Natural Products Chemistry and Free Radical Cancer Biology make her ideally suited to work inthis highly collaborative and integrated group doing both in vitro and in vivo translational research as well assupporting clinical trials. Dr. Fath will focus on the redox biology of O2- and H2O2 as well as the involvement ofFe metabolism in the differential effects of that mediate P-AscH- induced radio-chemotherapy sensitization.She will quantify radio-chemo- sensitization measure steady-state H2O2 study and manipulate labile ironpools using both pharmacological and genetic approaches and assess oxidative stress and DNA damageendpoints in cancer treatment models. In addition Dr. Fath will be responsible for measuring biomarkers ofoxidative stress in the clinical trials and determining if they correlate to clinical responses. It is clear that Dr.Fath's experience and expertise is invaluable to P01 CA217797 and she is well-qualified as a candidate for theP50 award mechanism.","Ascorbic Acid;Award;Biological Markers;Biology;Cancer Biology;Chemosensitization;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Core Facility;DNA Damage;Dose;Environment;Free Radicals;Funding;Glioblastoma;Grant;Hydrogen Peroxide;In Vitro;Intravenous;Ions;Iowa;Iron;Leadership;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Melissa;Metabolic;Metabolism;Metals;Modeling;Natural Products Chemistry;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Normal Cell;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pharmacologic Ascorbate;Pharmacology;Pharmacy facility;Plant Roots;Postdoctoral Fellow;Program Research Project Grants;Radiation Oncology;Radio;Radiobiology;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Testing;Toxic effect;Training;Translational Research;Universities;Wages;Work;ascorbate;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chemoradiation;drug repurposing;experience;genetic approach;improved;in vivo;iron metabolism;knowledge base;member;novel;oxidation;oxidative damage;pancreatic cancer cells;preclinical study;programs;radiation response;response;theories;translational study;tumor metabolism","Repurposing redox active agents for exploiting differences in cancer cell metabolism for improving cancer therapy","Project NarrativeIntravenous dosing of pharmacological levels of ascorbate has recently remerged as a redox active agent thatenhances lung glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer cell responses to radiation and chemotherapy withoutincreasing toxicity to normal cells.

This will be accomplished in 3 Aims. In Aim 1 we will extend our current work to define the natural history of FKRP-related dystroglycanopathy. We follow a unique cohort of patients aged early childhood through late adulthood with a range of FKRP mutations. We will expand and extend evaluation of this cohort using standard validated outcome measures. We will engage those who are no longer able to travel due to disease progression with remote assessments allowing us to relate motor outcomes to real-world endpoints (loss of ambulation need for respiratory support). We will also add additional evaluation sites for this patient cohort to expand the cohort and confirm that the outcome measures are valid across sites for the FKRP-related patient population. In Aim 2 we will extend our follow up of a cohort of dystroglycanopathy patients with mutations in genes other than FKRP. Each of these genotypes is quite rare. We will identify cohorts that share similar rates of motor progression who might be studied together in gene non-specific clinical trials. We will collect annual blood and urine samples from patients evaluated in Aims 1 and 2 and a subset of these samples will be used in Aim 3 for proteomic biomarker identification. Previous work identified a set of candidate protein biomarkers for patients with FKRP mutations. We will validate these in a separate set of patient samples and determine if any change in concert with disease progression. Discovery of new very low abundance proteins will produce novel candidates for validation.","Address;Adult;Age;Agreement;Biological Markers;Blood;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Data Collection;Disease;Disease Progression;Evaluation;Functional disorder;Genes;Genotype;Goals;Grouping;Heterogeneity;Individual;Interview;Life;Limb structure;Longitudinal Studies;Measures;Medical;Motor;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Natural History;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Participant;Patient Care;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Phenotype;Physical assessment;Plasma;Proteins;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Rare Diseases;Research;Research Personnel;Sampling;Site;Standardization;Study Subject;Techniques;Telephone;Therapy Clinical Trials;Travel;Urine;Validation;Work;aged;base;biomarker identification;candidate marker;candidate validation;clinical care;clinical phenotype;cohort;congenital muscular dystrophy;disease phenotype;dystroglycanopathy;early childhood;follow-up;fukutin related protein;insight;meetings;minimally invasive;novel;patient biomarkers;patient population;patient stratification;protein biomarkers;respiratory;telehealth","Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center: Project 2","n/a","NINDS","10238933","7/1/2021","RFA-NS-19-031","5P50NS053672-17","5","P50","NS","053672","17","","","6/8/2005","6/30/2025","ZHD1-DSR-Y","8208","9248330","MATHEWS, KATHERINE DIANNE","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","301697"," ","228473","122556"," "," ",
"Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Congenital Muscular Dystrophy; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Muscular Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Project 1 Project Summary The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underly muscular dystrophies in order to facilitate the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies and quantitative assays to assess target engagement and the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. Our current research focuses on the dystroglycanopathies a group of congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by defects in post-translational processing of the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor -dystroglycan (-DG). ECM proteins that contain laminin-G-like (LG) domains bind to -DG via a unique heteropolysaccharide [-GlcA-13-Xyl-13-]n called matriglycan. Genetic studies have shown that mutations in any one of at least eighteen genes encoding enzymes required for -DG post-translational processing lead to the absence of or a reduction in matriglycan and thus impair -DG receptor function. Although significant progress has been made in the identification and characterization of dystroglycanopathy genes we still do not fully understand the biochemical and physiological function of matriglycan or how its absence or reduction in length causes muscular dystrophy. The overall objective of the proposed research is to provide mechanistic insights into the role matriglycan plays in -DG receptor function and in the pathophysiology of the dystroglycanopathies. The overarching hypothesis of our research is that a thorough understanding of (a) the shortened matriglycan structure and resulting -DG receptor dysfunction in dystroglycanopathy patients and (b) the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the dystroglycanopathies will lead to more reliable diagnostics and novel therapeutic strategies. Specific Aim 1 will establish the relationship between -DG matriglycan length and laminin-binding properties of matriglycan on -DG in control and dystroglycanopathy patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies. These studies will reveal abnormalities in the post-translational processing of -DG that result in shorter matriglycan with reduced affinity for laminin leading to muscular dystrophy. Specific Aim 2 will define the biochemical regulation of matriglycan synthesis and its role in the receptor function of -DG. These studies will define the requirements for matriglycan synthesis and how its synthesis is regulated by protein-protein and protein-sugar interactions. Specific Aim 3 will define novel mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of the dystroglycanopathies and determine the structure and laminin binding properties required to improve muscle function. These studies will use myd mice with established dystrophic muscle pathology that are evaluated before and after LARGE gene transfer. Collectively these aims will provide an understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying dystroglycanopathies which will be needed to develop a rationale for the design of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies as well as approaches to monitoring therapeutic engagement and efficacy.","Affinity;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Cells;Clinical;Data;Defect;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Disease;Dystroglycan;ECM receptor;Enzymes;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fibroblasts;Functional disorder;Gene Transfer;Genes;Genetic study;Goals;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Impairment;Laminin;Lead;Length;Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies;Measurement;Measures;Molecular;Monitor;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mus;Muscle;Muscle function;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Physiological;Play;Production;Property;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Role;Severities;Stains;Structure;Techniques;Therapeutic;Treatment Efficacy;Validation;alpha Dystroglycan;clinical phenotype;design;dystroglycanopathy;enzyme substrate complex;improved;insight;novel;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutic intervention;receptor;receptor function;sugar;therapeutic effectiveness;therapy development","Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center: Project 1","n/a","NINDS","10238932","7/1/2021","RFA-NS-19-031","5P50NS053672-17","5","P50","NS","053672","17","","","6/8/2005","6/30/2025","ZHD1-DSR-Y","8207","1962294","CAMPBELL, KEVIN P.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","301697"," ","228473","122556"," "," ",

This Core has two major goals. Firstly it has established and will expand a tissue and cell culture Repository to support basic and translational research efforts. Currently this Repository contains muscle biopsies from more than 8500 patients with neuromuscular disorders as well as cryopreserved fibroblasts from more than 425 patients with myopathic disease predominantly muscular dystrophies. Well-characterized tissues and cells from the Core are made available to research investigators at Iowa as well as other academic centers across the USA and around the world. Secondly the Core provides specialty diagnostic services that are not readily available through clinical laboratories and facilitates research on and the development of new diagnostic tests for eventual transfer into clinical laboratories. These diagnostic services are very closely integrated with clinical laboratory testing carried out in the Department of Pathology at the University of Iowa. Together Core B and the Department of Pathology services provide state-of-the-art diagnostic testing for patients seen at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics and for patients referred to Iowa from throughout the USA and from several other countries.

"Muscular Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","CORE C SUMMARY The overall goal of Core C is to foster the growth and development of the next generation of neurologists and basic and translational scientists in an environment where basic scientists and clinicians interact regularly to advance knowledge about muscular dystrophy. Specifically each year Core C will support training activities for two Medical Student Fellows a Postdoctoral Fellow and an Undergraduate Research Fellow. The medical and postdoctoral fellows will be mentored by both Core Co-Leads (Drs. Campbell and Mathews) and the undergraduate fellow will be mentored by one of them. The educational efforts of the Center are vital because there is an urgent need for basic scientists and clinicians who can partner to develop test and implement muscular dystrophy therapies. By establishing the Medical Student Fellowship we will foster interest in academic child neurology (with a neuromuscular focus). This full-time fellowship will enable two medical students per year to participate in a range of MDSRC activities including care of muscular dystrophy patients in clinic evaluation of patients participating in Project 2 under the supervision of Dr. Mathews interpretation of muscle biopsies with Dr. Steven Moore and exposure to clinical trials. The Postdoctoral Research Fellowship will train scientists in the basic research of muscular dystrophy by providing a PhD MD or MD/PhD graduate with an intensive research experience in Dr. Campbell's laboratory. This experience will be complemented by observation of patient care in a clinical setting enhancing the fellow's understanding and appreciation of the clinical side of translational research. The Undergraduate Research Fellowship is designed to provide an intensive research experience in an MDSRC laboratory that will encourage students to pursue careers in translational science. This fellowship is awarded to students who are currently enrolled at the University of Iowa. These individuals will work closely with a postdoctoral advisor in an MDSRC laboratory. All trainees will participate in the monthly Wellstone Neuromuscular Conference where clinical fellows and faculty present interesting cases with discussion of literature and scientific trainees join in discussion. Current Wellstone trainees will actively participate in the Family and Patient Conference hosted by Core A by presenting their research and interacting one-on-one with patients and families. Web-based interactive cases will extend neuromuscular training to the wider community. Through these activities Core C will accelerate the education mission of the MDSRC and provide a vibrant training environment for clinician scientists.","Affect;Award;Basic Science;Biopsy;Caring;Childhood;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Complement;Development;Discipline;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Educational workshop;Electronic Mail;Enrollment;Environment;Evaluation;Exposure to;Faculty;Family;Feedback;Fellowship;Fostering;Funding;Funding Agency;Goals;Growth;Growth and Development function;Human Resources;Individual;Internships;Iowa;Knowledge;Laboratories;Literature;Medical;Medical Students;Medicine;Mentors;Mission;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Neurologist;Neurology;Neuromuscular Diseases;Neuromuscular research;Online Systems;Outcome;Pathology;Patient Care;Patient observation;Patients;Pediatric Neurology;Physicians;Postdoctoral Fellow;Research;Research Personnel;Research Support;Research Training;Residencies;Resources;Rotation;Scientist;Side;Students;Supervision;Testing;Time;Training;Training Activity;Training Support;Translational Research;Universities;Work;base;career;college;design;experience;improved;individual patient;interest;neurogenetics;neuromuscular;neuromuscular training;next generation;programs;symposium;training opportunity;translational scientist;undergraduate research;undergraduate student;web site","Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center: Core C","n/a","NINDS","10238930","7/1/2021","RFA-NS-19-031","5P50NS053672-17","5","P50","NS","053672","17","","","6/8/2005","6/30/2025","ZHD1-DSR-Y","8205","9248330","MATHEWS, KATHERINE DIANNE","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","301695"," ","228473","122555"," "," ",

"No NIH Category available","OVERALL SUMMARYThe overall goal of the University of Iowa Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center(MDSRC) is to perform research on the various muscular dystrophies that arise from abnormal processing ofthe dystroglycan protein (dystroglycanopathies). The Center will achieve this overall goal by conducting basicand translational research in dystroglycanopathy patients patient-derived biosamples and mouse models. OurMDSRC application is composed of two projects and three cores all of which are directed by investigators witha proven track record of excellence and collaboration in basic translational and clinical research. Project 1(Campbell) will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underly dystroglycanopathies byevaluating the relationship between -dystroglycan (-DG) matriglycan length and its laminin-bindingproperties in control and dystroglycanopathy patient fibroblasts and muscle biopsies. Additional studies willdefine the requirements for matriglycan synthesis as regulated by protein-protein and protein-sugarinteractions. A dystroglycanopathy mouse model will be utilized to identify novel pathophysiologic mechanismsand determine the structure and laminin binding properties required to improve muscle function. Project 2(Mathews) will refine the natural history of FKRP-related dystroglycanopathy derived from an establishedunique cohort of patients by expanding the number of clinical sites evaluating patients and by extending thenatural history study to patients with more advanced clinical severity. Extended follow up of non-FKRPgenotypes will identify cohorts that share similar rates of motor progression who might be studied together ingene non-specific clinical trials. Candidate proteomic biomarkers in blood or urine for the full spectrum ofdystroglycanopathy genotypes will be validated and related to disease status. Core A (Campbell and Moore) isan administrative core that will coordinate the activities within and outside the Center as a means to promotean interactive and collaborative research environment and to engage patients in muscular dystrophy research.Core B (Moore) a Muscle-Tissue/Cell-Culture/Diagnostics Core will support Projects 1 and 2 serve as anational tissue and cell-culture resource for research provide specialized diagnostic testing for a wide range ofmuscular dystrophies and maintain the infrastructure needed to evaluate muscle biopsies in support of clinicaltrials. Finally Core C (Mathews and Campbell) will coordinate our Training initiatives. Among the support thisCore provides will be fellowships enabling two medical students per year to perform research in the Center andto participate in the care of patients alongside Dr. Mathews with basic science training opportunities alsoprovided to a postdoctoral fellow and an undergraduate research fellow. The highly integrated cores andprojects of this Center will accelerate the tempo of discovery in preclinical translational research and alsoestablish the clinical-trial readiness of a cohort of dystroglycanopathy patients.","Advisory Committees;Basic Science;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Community Outreach;Cryopreservation;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Dystroglycan;Environment;Fellowship;Fibroblasts;Functional disorder;Genes;Genotype;Goals;Human Resources;Infrastructure;Iowa;Laboratories;Laminin;Length;Measures;Medical Students;Mission;Molecular;Motor;Muscle;Muscle function;Muscular Dystrophies;Myoblasts;Myocardial tissue;Natural History;Neuromuscular Diseases;Patient Care;Patients;Pediatric Neurology;Postdoctoral Fellow;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Resource Sharing;Resources;Role;Scientist;Severities;Skeletal Muscle;Structure;Testing;Tissues;Training;Translating;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Urine;alpha Dystroglycan;cell repository;clinical care;clinical research site;clinical trial readiness;cohort;design;dystroglycanopathy;follow-up;fukutin related protein;improved;insight;interest;medical schools;member;mouse model;muscle degeneration;next generation;novel;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutic intervention;pre-clinical;programs;receptor function;recruit;repository;skills;sugar;tissue/cell culture;training opportunity;undergraduate research;undergraduate student;user-friendly;web site","Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center","Overall Project NarrativeThe University of Iowa Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Specialized Research Center (MDSRC)promotes the NIH mission by enabling pre-clinical and clinical translational research fordystroglycan-associated muscular dystrophies (dystroglycanopathies) progressiveneuromuscular diseases characterized by severe skeletal muscle degeneration.

"Brain Disorders; Complementary and Integrative Health; Epilepsy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/AbstractMore than one-third of people with epilepsy have inadequate control of seizures even when takingmultiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures place patients at high riskof sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) a major cause of mortality in patients withdrug-resistant epilepsy. The high-fat very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (KDs) help somepatients with uncontrolled epilepsy especially children but have been described as unpalatableand are often not tolerated by patients leading to high rates of non-compliance.We have obtained preliminary data from a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome (DS) a devastatingchildhood-onset epilepsy with refractory seizures and a high incidence of SUDEP and foundseizure-induced death is greatly reduced by supplementing their diet with milk whey (WD). ThisWD was just as protective as two different KDs but did not require an increase in ketone bodies.Moreover our preliminary studies suggest that a WD and KDs increase 5-HT levels and 5-HTrelease in the brain of mice. This is important as 5-HT is known to inhibit seizures and also playsa critical role in control of breathing. Defects in the 5-HT system have been linked to bothrespiratory dysfunction and SUDEP. In this proposed project we will test the hypotheses that 1)whey prevents seizure-induced death by reducing seizure frequency and/or stimulating postictalbreathing via increased brain 5-HT and 2) whey prevents postictal death by reversing the basicunderlying defect in DS mice which is thought to be a decrease in excitability of GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. To determine how a WD affects seizures breathing and neurochemistrywe will use video-EEG/EKG to evaluate the anticonvulsant effects of a WD on spontaneous andhyperthermia-induced seizures and in vivo microdialysis with high performance liquidchromatography to measure extracellular 5-HT in the amygdala a region implicated in seizurepropagation and postictal apnea. We will perform patch clamp recordings on hippocampal brainslices from WD-fed DS mice to evaluate intrinsic electrophysiological properties of interneuronsand pyramidal neurons and will determine if changes in excitability due to the WD are mediatedby increased 5-HT signaling. These studies will provide preclinical data that may guide futureclinical trials to evaluate milk whey supplementation as a safe and healthy dietary therapy fordrug-resistant epilepsy that is more palatable and effective than the KD. These experiments mayalso lead to new avenues of treatment targeted at the serotonergic mechanisms engaged by milkwhey.","Affect;Amygdaloid structure;Anticonvulsants;Antiepileptic Agents;Apnea;Bathing;Behavior;Brain;Breathing;Carbohydrates;Cessation of life;Child;Childhood;Clinical Trials;Data;Defect;Detection;Development;Diet;Diet therapy;Drosophila genus;Electrocardiogram;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Epilepsy;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Food;Frequencies;Future;Genes;Glucose;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Incidence;Induced Hyperthermia;Interneurons;Intractable Epilepsy;Ions;Ketone Bodies;Ketones;Ketosis;Lead;Link;Literature;Measures;Mediating;Microdialysis;Milk;Modeling;Mus;Neurons;Nutritional;Outcome Study;Palate;Patients;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Physicians;Play;Prevention strategy;Production;Property;Rattus;Refractory;Research;Respiration Disorders;Risk;Role;Scientist;Seizures;Serotonergic System;Serotonin;Severities;Signal Transduction;Slice;Supplementation;Techniques;Testing;Tonic - clonic seizures;Training;Tryptophan;Work;base;blood glucose regulation;career;dietary control;dravet syndrome;experimental study;extracellular;feeding;fly;high risk;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;in vivo;inhibitory neuron;ketogenic diet;mortality;mouse model;mutant;neurochemistry;non-compliance;novel;nutritional guideline;patch clamp;pre-clinical;prevent;preventable epilepsy;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy;voltage","A novel dietary therapy for epilepsy: potential mechanisms of action","Project NarrativePeople with epilepsy who continue to have seizures despite taking multiple antiepileptic drugshave a high risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).

"Autism; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Pediatric; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health","ABSTRACT: RESEARCH PROJECTIntellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) affect up to one in six children in the United States withproposed etiologies ranging from genetic to multi-factorial. For a vast majority of children no clear genetic orenvironmental etiology is identified although evidence suggests that genetic (intrinsic) risk may interact withthe early learning and social environment (extrinsic risk) to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in laterstages of life. For example the neuropeptide oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) are epigenetically altered byearly social experience play crucial roles in mammalian social and cognitive development and are associatedwith both genetic and epigenetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The objective of this Hawk-IDDRCResearch Project is to examine epigenetic polygenic and environmental risk factors for IDD focusing on ASDas a prototype. We will use an innovative new smartphone application BabySteps to enroll and collect data on300 mothers and their children between 2 and 3 years of age over a 6-month period. One hundred and sixtyASD children will be enrolled along with 80 children with non-ASD developmental delay (DD) and 80 typicallydeveloping (TD) control children matched by race/ethnicity sex and family socioeconomic status. We willexamine changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) in 27 specific ASD-associated loci as well as 3 OXTR loci as afunction of age and social experience in children with and without autism comparing DNAm from storednewborn dried blood spots to samples collected at the time of diagnosis. Polygenic risk scores for ASD will becalculated using Illumina PsychArray and the relative polygenic and epigenetic risk assessed using resourcesfrom the Developmental Genomics/Epigenetics Core. The relationship between DNAm and socialexperience will be assessed using 2 complementary measures: 1) the Language Experience Analysis (LENA)based on audio recordings from a LENA device worn by the child over a 4-day period at home and in daycare;and 2) ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of parental social and emotional availability collected usingthe BabySteps app. Children will be recruited through the Clinical Translational Core and Autism Center afterASD is either confirmed or excluded based on ADOS testing and/or rigorous clinical assessment. A subset of20 ASD and 20 TD children will participate in pilot resting state functional connectivity scanning through theNeurocircuitry and Behavior Core to examine associations between DNAm of ASD-associated lociincluding OXTR and differences in brain connectivity. With the Administrative Core we will share theBabySteps app with other Centers in the IDDRC Network and prospectively compare the effects of perinatalstress and social/learning experience on DNAm in children yet to be diagnosed with ASD. It is hypothesizedthat both polygenic factors and early social experience (via epigenetic modifications) contribute to ASD or IDDrisk. Understanding how the environment interacts with genetic vulnerability will provide an unprecedentedopportunity to re-assess early intervention and prevention strategies.","3 year old;Affect;Age;Anxiety;Behavior;Birth;Blood;Brain;Cellular Phone;Child;Clinical;Clinical assessments;Collection;DNA;DNA Methylation;Data;Development;Developmental Delay Disorders;Developmental Disabilities;Devices;Diagnosis;Disease;Early Intervention;Ecological momentary assessment;Emotional;Enrollment;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;Ethnic Origin;Etiology;Family;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic study;Genomics;Goals;Hawks;Home;Individual;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers;Intellectual functioning disability;Intervention;Iowa;Language;Life;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;Measures;Mediating;Mental Depression;Methylation;Modeling;Modification;Mothers;Neuropeptides;Newborn Infant;Oranges;Outcome;Oxytocin;Oxytocin Receptor;Perinatal;Play;Pregnancy;Prevalence;Prevention strategy;Race;Receptor Gene;Research;Research Project Grants;Resources;Rest;Risk;Risk Marker;Role;Sampling;Scanning;Site;Social Development;Social Environment;Societies;Socioeconomic Status;Spottings;Stress;Testing;Time;United States;Universities;adolescent with autism spectrum disorder;autism spectrum disorder;autistic behaviour;autistic children;base;cognitive development;cohort;cost estimate;disability;disability risk;educational atmosphere;experience;innovation;neural circuit;polygenic risk score;prospective;prototype;rare condition;receptor;recruit;repetitive behavior;sex;smartphone Application;social;social communication;social learning;trait","Project: Epigenetics Polygenic Risk and the Social Environment in Autism","","NICHD","10238635","7/15/2021","RFA-HD-21-009","1P50HD103556-01A1","1","P50","HD","103556","01","A1","","7/16/2021","5/31/2026","Special Emphasis Panel[ZHD1 DSR-H (57)]","8722","7033504","STRATHEARN, LANE ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2021","3/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","264328"," ","171086","93242"," "," ",

The Core will support research projects affiliated with the Hawk- IDDRC that utilize both animals and humans as well as those that cross-fertilize a translational approach to the study of IDD from a lifespan perspective. The Core is made up of two units: 1) Neuroimaging Division (NID) and 2) Neural Circuits and Behavior Division (NCBD). The NID will assist in the development implementation and completion of neuroimaging research studies in animal models as well as humans. Neuroimaging modalities will focus on imaging techniques to assess brain structure function and metabolism. The resources provided will include expertise in the following aspects of brain imaging: a) development of novel imaging tools pulse sequences and equipment; b) implementation of protocols for image acquisition; c) implementation and deployment of standard image analysis pipelines; d) development of novel image analysis strategies; and e) data management bioinformatics and statistical support for imaging data. The NCBD will provide expertise in neural circuit function behavior (e.g. social interaction sleep) and cognition (e.g. learning and memory) in animal models and humans using tools that are often not available within individual laboratories. For studies using animal models the NCBD will provide facilities and services to aid investigators performing behavioral assays. For human studies the NCBD has significant expertise in studying human behavior and cognition across the lifespan and will design and implement cognitive paradigms to study neural circuits which can be applied to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as controls. Finally the NID and NCBD are able to conduct experiments as requested by investigators or will provide the necessary training to enable laboratory personnel to perform experiments in the facility. The NBC will integrate and capitalize upon strong existing resources currently available at the University of Iowa including the Iowa Institute for Biomedical Imaging (IIBI) and the Iowa Neuroscience Institute (INI). Tools that are developed as part of the NBC will be shared with IDD investigators across the country. The NBC will support 27 federally funded projects ($11.3 million per year) and will build upon strong existing collaborations between basic scientists who use animal models and clinical scientists engaged in human brain studies. In addition the NBC will help strengthen the relationship between scientists and the IDD community and their families many of whom live in rural areas helping foster collaborations that will enable a better understanding of IDD from a lifespan perspective.","Address;Adult;Age;Animal Model;Animals;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Assay;Bioinformatics;Brain;Brain imaging;Child;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cognition;Cognitive;Collaborations;Communities;Conceptions;Country;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Elderly;Ensure;Equipment;Experimental Designs;Family;Fostering;Funding;Hawks;Human;Image;Image Analysis;Imaging Device;Imaging Techniques;Individual;Institutes;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers;Intellectual functioning disability;Investigation;Iowa;Knowledge;Laboratories;Laboratory Finding;Laboratory Personnel;Learning;Longevity;Manuals;Memory;Metabolism;Modality;Monitor;Neurosciences;Physiologic pulse;Prevention;Process;Protocols documentation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resources;Rural Population;Scientist;Services;Sleep;Social Interaction;Specific qualifier value;Structure;System;Technology;Training;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Translating;Translations;Universities;analysis pipeline;bioimaging;cognitive change;cost effectiveness;data management;design;disability;experimental study;flexibility;human model;laboratory experience;neonate;neural circuit;neuroimaging;novel;programs;quality assurance;research study;rural area;service utilization;tool;translational approach","Core D: Neurocircuitry and Behavior Core","","NICHD","10238634","7/15/2021","RFA-HD-21-009","1P50HD103556-01A1","1","P50","HD","103556","01","A1","","7/16/2021","5/31/2026","Special Emphasis Panel[ZHD1 DSR-H (57)]","8721","1906889","NOPOULOS, PEGGY C","MAGNOTTA, VINCENT A","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2021","3/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","237616"," ","153797","83819"," "," ",
"Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Human Genome; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health","PROJECT SUMMARY: DEVELOPMENTAL GENOMICS/EPIGENETICS CORE (DGC)The primary objective of the Developmental Genomics/Epigenetics core (DGC) is to support innovative andcutting-edge genome-scale research of intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) across the lifespanfrom conception to adulthood tailored to a rural population. Under the leadership of co-directors Dr. RichardSmith and Dr. Jake Michaelson who together have substantial NIH-backed experience in experimental(Smith) and computational (Michaelson) genomics the DGC will provide broad expertise that encompassesmodel system development high-throughput sequencing technologies (e.g. genome and exome sequencingRNA sequencing chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing methylation sequencing and ribosomesequencing) and bioinformatics and computational analysis of the results. Each of these foundational servicesis housed within its own organizational unit: 1) the Genomics Division provides high-throughput sequencingand array services including exome and genome sequencing RNA-sequencing (including 10X Chromiumsingle-cell sequencing) and array-based genotyping and methylation services under the direction of Dr.Richard Smith an accomplished genomics investigator; and 2) the Bioinformatics Division provides servicesfor quality control basic processing (e.g. alignment variant calling and expression quantification) andpipelines for calculating polygenic risk scores from data produced by array or sequencing services generatedby the genomics division and is led by Dr. Jake Michaelson an experienced computational genomicsinvestigator. The DGC will utilize existing resources within the Iowa Institute for Human Genetics (led by co-director Dr. Richard Smith) which has a strong track record in education and dissemination with regularlyoccurring workshops tutorials videos and online certification opportunities. Since its inception the DGC hasbeen calibrated to the overall theme of the Hawk-IDDRC: IDD research across the lifespan. In particularepigenetic signatures specific to development and aging are accessible through the Core's epigenetic array-and sequencing-based assays. The DGC also interrogates intrinsic and extrinsic sources of risk by offeringgenomic (intrinsic) and epigenetic (extrinsic) assay options. Finally a focus on rural populations is achievedthrough the extensive experience of both Drs. Smith and Michaelson in collecting samples from sparselypopulated areas both in person and through mail recruitment campaigns (e.g. using saliva collection kits orGuthrie cards). Services from the DGC will complement and synergize with those of the other Cores in theCenter such as with the Clinical Translational Core in recruitment efforts to obtain biosamples and willsupport 17 federally funded projects ($4.8 million per year). Collectively the available expertise and cutting-edge services provided by the DGC will catalyze IDD research by minimizing barriers for entry into genome-scale studies of neurodevelopment and cognitive function.","Adopted;Adult;Aging;Animal Model;Animals;Area;Back;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Certification;ChIP-seq;Chromium;Clinical;Clinical Research;Code;Collection;Communities;Complement;Complex;Computer Analysis;Computer software;Conceptions;Country;DNA Methylation;DNA methylation profiling;Data;Data Analyses;Data Pooling;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Education;Educational workshop;Ensure;Epigenetic Process;Equipment;Exons;Foundations;Funding;Genetic;Genome;Genomics;Genotype;Hawks;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Human;Human Genetics;Institutes;Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers;Intellectual functioning disability;Iowa;Laboratories;Leadership;Longevity;Machine Learning;Manuals;Meta-Analysis;Methodology;Methylation;Microarray Analysis;Mus;Organization administrative structures;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prevention;Protein Isoforms;Quality Control;Rattus;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resources;Ribosomes;Risk;Rural Population;Saliva;Sampling;Services;Small Nuclear RNA;Source;Standardization;Systems Development;Technology;Tissues;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Variant;Zebrafish;analysis pipeline;analytical method;base;bioinformatics resource;cognitive function;computing resources;cost effectiveness;data format;differential expression;epigenomics;exome sequencing;experience;experimental study;genome sequencing;genome-wide;genomic data;human model;human tissue;innovation;insight;methylome;neurodevelopment;novel;polygenic risk score;programs;recruit;research study;service utilization;single cell sequencing;single-cell RNA sequencing;tool;training opportunity;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;whole genome","Core C: Developmental Genomics-Epigenetics Core","","NICHD","10238633","7/15/2021","RFA-HD-21-009","1P50HD103556-01A1","1","P50","HD","103556","01","A1","","7/16/2021","5/31/2026","Special Emphasis Panel[ZHD1 DSR-H (57)]","8720","1877370","SMITH, RICHARD J.H.","MICHAELSON, JACOB JAMES","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2021","3/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","240129"," ","155423","84706"," "," ",
"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Health Services; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Pediatric; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health","PROJECT SUMMARY: CLINICAL TRANSLATIONAL CORE (CTC)The Clinical Translational Core (CTC) of the Hawk-IDDRC seeks to address the challenges faced by thoseliving with IDD at all life stages by providing investigators the resources to transition discoveries from thelaboratory into clinical practice and enable an understanding of the biology underlying clinical observations inorder to advance translational research. The CTC differentiates itself by providing infrastructure for recruitingrural populations as well as participants at key transition points across the lifespan including: the perinatalperiod puberty and adolescence adulthood at varying levels of independence and later adulthood asprofessional caregivers assume a primary role. These transition points represent critical periods that influencethe long-term wellbeing of those living with IDD yet our understanding of each is limited. Importantly ruralpopulations 1) have decreased access to appropriate care 2) have different potential IDD exposures that arenot well studied and 3) lack research infrastructure. The Hawk-IDDRC CTC is poised to fill these needs andwill thus provide access to unique clinical data and biosamples from this understudied population by carryingout the following aims: 1) Facilitate and accelerate the recruitment and clinical evaluation of IDD-affectedpatients at all stages of life and from diverse areas to connect them and their families with clinical studies andresources; 2) Provide IDD researchers with biobanking and bioinformatics services; 3) Facilitate and supportthe design development and testing of novel IDD therapies by providing a successful architecture for clinicaltrials and drug manufacturing services to IDD researchers. The expertise and resources of the CTC Co-Directors (Mark Santillan and Alexander Bassuk) covers a broad spectrum of capabilities ranging fromprenatal risk assessment to human subject recruitment and banking of clinical data and biosamples.

"Endocrine Disruptors; Health Disparities; Pediatric","SUMMARY: Iowa Superfund Research Program OverallThe Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) is a center of research excellence focused on polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs). PCBs were widely produced in the mid-20th century and used in thousands of products fromcommon household items to construction materials until the chemicals were banned 40 years ago. Todaypeople are still exposed to PCBs indoors and in communities surrounding Superfund sites. Recent ISRPresearch demonstrated that airborne PCBs present an especially urgent problem: Inhalation of airborne PCBsmay be the most significant route for human exposure to these important toxic chemicals. The ISRPs long-term goal is to develop recommendations to prevent and/or limit human exposure to airborne PCBs and toimprove the health and well-being of the population. The ISRP renewal will focus on PCBs in air particularly inbuildings (especially schools) and those emitted from contaminated waters (including Superfund sites). We willexamine the health impacts of inhaled PCBs particularly on adolescents with a focus on neurodevelopmentaland metabolic effects. The ISRP will accomplish its long-term goal through the following integrated SpecificAims: 1) Clarify the biochemical mechanisms of toxicity of lower-chlorinated PCBs in adolescence. Twoprojects will address how PCBs and their metabolites are risk factors for altered neurodevelopment duringadolescence and the mechanisms by which these compounds interfere with lipid metabolism. 2) Definesusceptible populations assess exposure and accumulation of these compounds (particularly inschools) and evaluate the relative importance of airborne vs. dietary exposure. Three cohorts ofmothers and adolescents will help us evaluate individuals exposure to airborne PCBs the specificenvironments that contribute to inhalation exposure and its importance compared to exposure through diet. 3)Reduce emissions of airborne PCBs from building materials products and contaminated sediments.We will investigate sources of airborne PCBs in indoor environments determine the magnitude of emissionsfrom contaminated waters and identify cost-effective strategies to remove or reduce emissions. This includesdevelopment of a new approach using novel materials to sequester lower chlorinated PCBs in sediments andbreak down PCBs through microbial processes to reduce PCB emissions from contaminated waters. 4) Trainand attract new scientists to the environmental health sciences. Our training program will enhanceresearch skills in data science chemical analysis community engagement and research translation. 5)Engage the scientific community and stakeholders in bi-directional communication on ISRP researchpriorities findings and recommendations. We will communicate the ISRPs research approaches andfindings to a wide range of researchers agencies and community stakeholders to maximize impact andenable communities to make timely informed decisions to reduce local PCB exposure.","Address;Adolescence;Adolescent;Air;Area;Bacteria;Biochemical;Biological;Centers of Research Excellence;Chemicals;Child;Communication;Communities;Complex;Construction Materials;Data;Data Science;Detection;Development;Diet;Environment;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollutants;Evaluation;Exposure to;Family;Goals;Health;Home;Household;Human;Individual;Indoor environment;Industrialization;Inhalation;Inhalation Exposure;Intervention;Iowa;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolic;Metabolic syndrome;Methods;Molecular;Mothers;Neurodevelopmental Impairment;Personal Satisfaction;Poison;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Process;Program Research Project Grants;Recommendation;Research;Research Activity;Research Personnel;Research Priority;Research Project Grants;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Factors;Route;Schools;Scientist;Site;Soil;Source;Superfund;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Training;Training Programs;Translating;Translational Research;base;building materials;career;cohort;community engagement;contaminated sediment;contaminated water;cost effective;design;detection method;dietary;experience;exposed human population;fungus;improved;innovation;lipid metabolism;microbial;neurodevelopment;new technology;novel;novel strategies;prevent;programs;remediation;skills;superfund chemical;superfund site;tool","Airborne PCBs: Sources Exposures Toxicities Remediation","NARRATIVE: Iowa Superfund Research Program OverallThe Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) will expand our understanding of the sources avenues ofexposure toxic effects and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a large family of environmentalpollutants that cause neurodevelopmental impairment metabolic syndrome and cancer in humans.

"Clinical Research; Health Services; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Telehealth","AbstractPatients are increasingly leaving the hospital sooner and continuing therapies historically onlyadministered in hospitals in their homes. One of the first of such therapies was the homeadministration of intravenous antibiotics referred to as outpatient parenteral antimicrobialtherapy (OPAT). Many patients discharged on OPAT require unplanned hospital readmissionsand visits to the emergency department within the first 30 days of discharge. Because thispopulation routinely suffers from a wide range of medical and surgical problems it presents aunique opportunity to efficiently study a range of health outcomes in a vulnerable population.The emerging ubiquity of personal computing devices provides new opportunities to collecthealth-related data outside traditional clinical environments. The promise of collectingmeaningful data increases if survey questions can be paired with objective informationcollected from sensors capable of collecting health-related data. To date our CTSA hub at TheUniversity of Iowa has designed tested and deployed custom m-health software to aggregateinformation from subjects using SMS web-based tools and mobile apps. We have alsointegrated information directly from sensors (step counters blood pressure cuffs scalesthermometers) into our custom software so that we can remotely collect objective health-relateddata from research subjects. In this proposal we will use our m-health platform to shift health-related measurements and data collection previously only available in hospitals into researchsubjects' homes. In addition we will use our approach to measure health-related outcomesamong patients discharged on OPAT.The overarching goal of our research is to develop easy-to-use informatics tools that are notdisease specific. With these tools we hope to enable the efficient collection of important clinicaldata from patients outside traditional research and clinical settings. First we will assess thefeasibility of using our mobile-health approach to gather clinical data from patients in theirhomes following discharge from the hospital on OPAT. Second we will determine subject andresearcher perspectives regarding the utility of our approach. Third we will estimate the samplesize necessary to power a study to determine the utility of remotely-collected patient-reporteddata for predicting hospital readmissions among patients discharged on OPAT.Completion of these aims will allow us to determine the potential for using m-health tools in areal-world setting to gather not only patient-reported outcomes but also data from sensors tohelp answer a wide range of clinical research questions.","Accident and Emergency department;Address;Antibiotics;Blood Pressure;Bluetooth;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinics and Hospitals;Collaborations;Collection;Computer software;Custom;Data;Data Collection;Data Reporting;Devices;Environment;Feedback;Funding;Future;Generations;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Home;Home environment;Hospitals;Interview;Iowa;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outpatients;Participant;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Persons;Population;Population Heterogeneity;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Subjects;Sample Size;Schedule;Site;Specialized Center;Surveys;Telephone;Testing;Text Messaging;Thermometers;Time;Translational Research;Universities;Visit;Vulnerable Populations;Washington;acceptability and feasibility;antimicrobial;base;design;hospital readmission;improved;informatics tool;intravenous administration;mHealth;mobile application;novel strategies;remote monitoring;rural area;sensor;tool;urban area;web-based tool","Determining the acceptability and feasibility of mobile-health approaches to gather clinical information from patients at home following hospital discharge","NarrativeWe will use texting photos and Bluetooth thermometers to observe the progress of patientsdischarged on outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT).

Reported problems include under-diagnosis and poortreatment of pain painful and unnecessary investigations and inappropriate use of aggressivetreatments. Some studies have reported that capitated Medicare-Advantage (MA) plans thatare paid on a per-person (rather than a per-service) basis may be better positioned thantraditional fee-for-service Medicare to promote the use of recommended services at the end oflife while discouraging unnecessary hospitalizations and invasive procedures. In addition thehospice carve-out also creates a strong financial incentive for MA plans to promote hospiceenrollment among their terminally ill patients. On the other hand capitated payments incentivizeMA plans to selectively contract with health providers and restrict services and choice ofproviders in order to control costs. MA beneficiaries face higher cost-sharing if they receive carefrom providers outside of their network. Narrow networks can also influence quality of caredirectly if higher-quality providers are unwilling to accept low payment rates. Therefore therelationship between MA enrollment on service use and quality of care is potentially a mixture ofdifferent effects that vary across outcomes and patients necessitating robust empirical evidenceon both the direction and magnitude of these effects. Much of existing literature in this areafocuses on the use of a few health services does not account for potential selection bias in MAenrollment precedes enrollment changes accompanying the 2010 health reform and does notspecifically focus on dementia patients. Our study employs multiple waves of unique population-based mortality follow-back data associated with the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (2000-2014) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) (2012-2017) to examine therelationship between MA enrollment and three categories of end of life care outcomes: patternsof care (including site of death) out-of-pocket expenditures and perceived quality of end of lifecare among dementia decedents. It also harnesses the core HRS and NHATS files to accountfor longitudinal patterns of insurance coverage among dementia decedents. We also proposeseveral sensitivity and heterogeneity analyses to enhance the robustness of our findings.","Accounting;Address;Affordable Care Act;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;American;Area;Back;Caring;Categories;Cessation of life;Chronic Care;Complex;Continuity of Patient Care;Contracts;Cost Control;Cost Sharing;Data;Dementia;Development;Diagnosis;Enrollment;Evaluation;Expenditure;Face;Fee-for-Service Plans;Future;Growth;Health;Health Care Reform;Health Personnel;Health Services;Health Services Accessibility;Health and Retirement Study;Heterogeneity;Home;Hospitalization;Incentives;Individual;Insurance;Insurance Coverage;Investigation;Length of Stay;Link;Literature;Managed Care Programs;Measures;Medical;Medicare;Methodology;Modeling;Outcome;Pain;Pain management;Palliative Care;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pattern;Patterns of Care;Persons;Policies;Population;Positioning Attribute;Procedures;Provider;Quality of Care;Reporting;Role;Sampling;Selection Bias;Service delivery model;Services;Site;Specialist;Surveys;Terminal Disease;Terminally Ill;Time;Training;advanced dementia;advanced disease;aggressive therapy;aging population;base;beneficiary;care coordination;care delivery;care outcomes;care providers;end of life;end of life care;financial incentive;health plan;health service use;hospice environment;innovation;mortality;payment;population based;preference;programs;symptom management;trend","Medicare Advantage and End of Life Care for Patients with Advanced Dementia","The results will indicate the extent to which Medicare Advantage meets the preferences andneeds of terminal dementia patients.

"Diabetes; Nutrition","AbstractAberrant redox homeostasis has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes(T2D). However the mechanisms are poorly understood. Redox systems are regulated by pro-oxidantssuch as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants such as glutathione. Patients with T2D haveelevated levels of ROS and lower levels of glutathione. Attempts to reverse this redox imbalance in T2Dusing redox-modulating drugs or infusion of antioxidants has shown promise in reversing insulin resistancein preliminary studies but ultimately have failed in clinical trials due to their short half-lives and deliverychallenges. New methods and a better understanding of redox mechanisms in T2D are needed to addressan underlying pathophysiology of T2D that is not currently effectively addressed by current modalities. ROSpossess an unpaired electron making them paramagnetic and capable of interacting with externally appliedelectromagnetic fields (EMFs). We recently identified a unique set of EMF parameters that rapidly modulateROS and redox homeostasis. When applied to mouse models of T2D and human cells EMFs were found toexert remarkable effects on glycemia and insulin sensitivity reversing glucose intolerance and insulinresistance in three days without adverse effects. We also found that application of EMFs altered themetabolic flux of glucose increasing glucose incorporation into glycogen and reducing fatty acid levels.Scavenging paramagnetic ROS or preventing redox adaptations by infusing oxidizing redox solutions(GSSG) abolished these striking therapeutic effects. These findings lead us to hypothesize that EMFs targetROS to induce an NRF2-mediated redox response that is insulin sensitizing in part by altering the fate ofglucose. Therefore the goal of this project is to elucidate the redox and metabolic mechanisms underlyingthe insulin sensitizing effects of EMFs. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) Determine theredox mechanisms that mediate the insulin-sensitizing effects of EMF-therapy; and 2) Determine themechanisms by which EMF-therapy or redox modulation redirects the metabolic fate of glucose to improveinsulin sensitivity. The use of EMFs as a redox- and glycemia-modulating modality provides anunprecedented opportunity to study the role of redox in T2D pathophysiology and to advance theunderstanding of a novel insulin sensitizing phenomenon. We will identify specific metabolic changes thatoccur in response to EMF exposure and determine mechanisms by which the redox state regulates hepaticmetabolic flux and insulin sensitivity. This work will identify a novel mechanistic link between two previouslydisconnected fields of inquiry static EMFs and glycemic regulation and will bridge redox biology withglucose metabolism.

The proposed project will provide me with training in three new areas which are critical to extend myprevious training. These skills include the collection and analysis of (1) observations of family membersinteractions (2) stress stress-protective and immune biomarkers and (3) the translation of basic research intofamily-based interventions. This will allow me to examine the links between family processes and biologicalmechanisms that influence health and well-being outcomes. This project also provides foundational knowledgewhich I can apply to future family-based caregiving interventions. The proposed project will highlight the role offamily relations in caregivers physical health and psychological well-being by considering the network in whichcaregivers are embedded. This project has three aims: (1) Determine whether perceptions of parental carepreferences and perceptions of equity in the division of care influence sibling interaction strategies and identifythe implications of sibling interaction strategies on sibling relationship quality (2) identify changes in stress andstress-protective biomarkers in response to sibling interactions and (3) identify the implications of siblingrelationship quality during ADRD caregiving for cumulative biological health indicators psychological well-beingand physical health. The proposed project extends this previous work by employing an innovative combinationof survey observational and biomarker data collected from two adult children in 100 families; and will be the firststudy to combine these three types of data to study sibling relationships in the context of caregiving. This studyis novel in its approach by employing observational coding of the interaction strategies adult siblings use whendiscussing their parents past and future care needs; and also assessing the physiological reactions to theseinteractions by measuring stress (i.e. cortisol) and stress-protective biomarkers (i.e. dehydroepiandrosterone orDHEA). Further I will consider the consequences of sibling relationship quality on cumulative stress stress-protective and immune (i.e. secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) C-reactive protein (CRP) interleukin 1-beta (IL-1) and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV)) biomarkers. The findings from this study will fill a knowledge gap regardingthe health vulnerability of adult children during a stressful life event.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Substance Misuse","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTGeneral population surveys have regularly found that less than one-quarter of adults with a lifetime alcohol usedisorder (AUD) ever obtain treatment; nevertheless the majority of those with AUD will achieve remission atsome point. This phenomenon of untreated recovery (also known as natural recovery spontaneous remissionand quantum change) has been long recognized but remains poorly understood. For example several decadesof research have confirmed its existence and even identified correlates; however interventions to promoterecovery outside of treatment have yielded equivocal or modest results which are likely the result of unaddressedgaps such as little knowledge of the meaning of recovery and the mechanisms of behavior change outside oftraditional treatment services. Guided by Stall and Biernacki's conceptual model of spontaneous remission fromcompulsive behaviors and integrating processes of change from the Transtheoretical Model the proposed studywill use mixed quantitative-qualitative approaches to identify the processes associated with recovery outside oftreatment and test how recovery definitions relate to those processes and recovery outcomes. Specific aims are:(1) to characterize recovery definitions by treatment exposure; (2) to identify the processes of recovery withouttreatment; (3) to estimate the likelihood of sustained recovery and identify modifiable correlates to supportrecovery; and in an exploratory aim (4) to investigate variation by subgroups. First a detailed onlinequestionnaire will be administered to 1500 adults with resolved problematic drinking drawn from KnowledgePanel (Ipsos Public Affairs; Norwalk CT) a pre-existing national probability sample. Respondents will beclassified as in treated recovery (used specialty services with or without 12-step groups) assisted recovery(used 12-step groups but not specialty services) or independent recovery (never used specialty services or 12-step groups) which will permit contrasts by level of intervention exposure (i.e. independent vs. assisted andtreated recovery groups). Under Aim 1 we will use Kaskutas and colleagues' multi-dimensional What IsRecovery scale to quantify conceptualizations of recovery using cross-sectional baseline survey data (n=1500).Under Aim 2 we will conduct qualitative interviews with a purposive sub-set (n=80) of respondents in assistedand independent recovery to investigate the meaning of recovery what guides the decision not to seek treatmentand how respondents initiate and maintain behavior change. Under Aim 3 a subset of respondents in earlyrecovery (<5 years; n=270) will be followed for 3 additional years completing annual quantitative surveys toestablish stability of recovery and identify factors associated with successful maintenance of recovery by group.Our long-term goal is to expand the repertoire of responses to problem drinking. Findings may be used to developand test novel low-threshold interventions to promote recovery among people who are unable or unwilling toseek specialty treatment services.","Abstinence;Address;Adult;Alcohol abuse;Alcohol consumption;Alcohols;Baseline Surveys;Behavioral;Behavioral Mechanisms;Capital;Complement;Compulsive Behavior;Conscious;Data;Dimensions;Disease remission;Elements;Ethnic Origin;Evaluation;Exposure to;Gender;General Population;Goals;Institute of Medicine (U.S.);Intervention;Interview;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Maintenance;Minority;Modeling;Nature;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Probability Samples;Process;Psyche structure;Questionnaires;Race;Recovery;Reporting;Research;Resources;Respondent;Services;Spirituality;Spontaneous Remission;Stimulus;Subgroup;Surveys;Telephone Interviews;Testing;Thinking;Tobacco use;Variant;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol exposure;alcohol intervention;alcohol services;alcohol use disorder;behavior change;behavior influence;cost effective;drinking;follow-up;medical specialties;member;novel;peer;population survey;quantum;racial and ethnic disparities;response;service utilization;treatment disparity;treatment services;uptake","Recovery Definitions and Behavior Change Processes in Recovery outside of Treatment","PROJECT NARRATIVEOnly a minority of adults with alcohol use disorder ever obtain treatment but a large proportion of them will goon to resolve their drinking problem.

"Genetics; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","Defects in the maintenance of stem cells can result in loss of the ability of tissues to regenerate or converselyin dysregulated growth and cancer. How the stem cell resists losing its regenerative qualities while retainingcontrol of proliferation remains poorly understood. The melanocyte stem cell (MSC) is an ideal model for thestudy of adult stem cells in general. Either the apoptosis or differentiation of this cell type can cause hairgraying and mutations in MITF which encodes the master regulator of melanocyte development have beenshown to cause hair graying in mice. Mutations in TFAP2A (Transcription Factor Activating-enhancer bindingProtein 2 alpha) cause branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS) which includes premature hair graying.However the mechanisms whereby TFAP2 proteins contribute to the relevant regulatory networks in MSCsremain unclear. Based on extensive preliminary data from zebrafish mice and cultured human melanocytesour overall hypothesis is that AP-2 activity regulates pluripotency growth and differentiation in melanocytesand MSCs working in parallel with MITF and regulated by KCTD15-mediated sumoylation. In Aim 1 we willtest the hypothesis that that cell-autonomous TFAP2 activity provided redundantly by two paralogs isnecessary for the maintenance of MSCs and that BOFS-associated TFAP2A variants inhibit both paralogsleading to ectopic differentiation of MSCs and to hair graying. We will test this hypothesis in mice by deletingthe relevant Tfap2 paralogs in MSCs or in cells of the MSC niche and examining hair graying and MSC status.In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that TFAP2 paralogs serve as pioneer factors at a subset of the loci towhich MITF binds facilitating MITF-mediated activation of genes that promote growth and differentiation. Thiswill entail deleting TFAP2 paralogs from a melanoma cell line and then assessing open chromatin using ATAC-SEQ and binding of MITF using ChIP-SEQ. We will carry out parallel experiments in primary melanoblastsisolated from zebrafish embryos. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that a negative feedback loop in TFAP2Asignaling is necessary for the correct balance of maintenance and recruitment of MSCs. We found that apotent inhibitor of TFAP2-paralog transactivation activity KCTD15 is expressed in melanocytes and thatzebrafish kctd15a/b mutants exhibit supernumerary ectopic melanocytes. We will test the model that Kctd15-mediated sumoylation of Tfap2a blocks its transactivation activity testing sumoylation in vitro. We will testkctd15a for a role in controlling melanocyte differentiation by abrogating its expression in the melanocytelineage. We will also test the prediction that inhibition of TFAP2 mediates the effects of KCTD15 in themelanocyte lineage. The expected outcome of the proposed research is a deeper understanding of pathwaysthat regulate the balance of growth and differentiation of MSCs. An understanding of the mechanisms wherebyMITF and TFAP2 proteins contribute to MSC maintenance and of how these factors are regulated will have abroad impact as they participate in mechanisms of aging and in the initiation and progression of melanoma.","ATAC-seq;Acceleration;Address;Aging;Apoptosis;Binding;Biological Assay;Branchio-Oculo-Facial Syndromes;Cell Aging;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cell Maintenance;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Data;Defect;Development;Differentiation and Growth;Embryo;Enhancers;Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase;Epithelial;Equilibrium;Exhibits;Family;Feedback;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Epistasis;Genetic Transcription;Growth;Hair;Hair Removal;Hair follicle structure;Hair shaft structure;Homeostasis;Human;Improve Access;In Vitro;Ligase;MEL Gene;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Melanoma Cell;Modeling;Mus;Mutation;Natural regeneration;Neural Crest;Normal Cell;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pigments;Proliferating;Proteins;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Regulatory Element;Regulatory Pathway;Reporter;Research;Role;Signal Transduction;Skin;Stem Cell Development;Study models;Sumoylation Pathway;Syndrome;TFAP2A gene;Testing;Tissues;Transactivation;Transcription Coactivator;Transcription Factor AP-2 Alpha;Variant;Zebrafish;activating transcription factor;adult stem cell;base;cell behavior;cell type;enhancer-binding protein AP-2;experimental study;in vitro Assay;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;melanoblast;melanocyte;melanoma;member;microphthalmia-associated transcription factor;mutant;overexpression;paralogous gene;pluripotency;premature;prevent;recruit;regenerative;senescence;stem cell function;stem cell niche;stem cells;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing","Regulation of the Melanocyte Lineage by the AP2 Transcription Factor Family","Stem cells are subject to differentiation leading to loss of tissue homeostasis or unregulated growth potentially leading to cancer.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Coronaviruses; Coronaviruses Vaccines; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related","To prevent deadly CoV infections we propose to study the molecular basis of coronavirus-inducedlung edema and its resolution through the identification of (i) Signaling pathwaysresulting in severe lung disease to inform inhibitors as antiviral candidates; and (ii) Virusvirulence genes. Deletion of these genes will lead to attenuated vaccine candidates. Three aimsare proposed: Aim 1. To determine the factors involved in edema induction and resolutionduring CoV infection. We have shown that both E and 3a proteins of SARS-CoV and proteins Eand 5 of MERS-CoV include two sequence domains involved in virulence one containing a PDZbinding motif (PBM) and another one encoding ion channel (IC) activity. The binding of theSARS-CoV E protein PBM to proteins containing the PDZ motif causes Acute RespiratoryDisease Syndrome in infected animals. The importance of the PBM is likely associated with itsability to bind to more than 400 cellular proteins and therefore to regulate many cell signalingpathways. We will study the whole-proteome interactions between PBMs in MERS-CoV andcellular PDZs. This interactome will be the basis for the identification of peptides interfering withPBM-PDZ binding using peptide libraries. The mechanism of inflammasome activation byMERS-CoV proteins with IC activity will be studied. Edema resolution is possible by twoenzymatic activities: epithelial sodium channel activity (ENa+C) and Na+/K+ ATPase that moveNa+ ions from the alveolar fluid into the interstitium promoting water elimination. We showedthat SARS-CoV E protein binds Na+/K+ ATPase and have postulated that this binding reducesNa+/K+ ATPase activity leading to lung edema; this will be investigated in this project.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Coronaviruses; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related","Project Summary/AbstractMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was recognized as a significant illness onthe Saudi Arabian peninsula in mid-2012 and the causative agent was rapidly identifiedas a novel coronavirus (CoV) termed MERS-CoV. MERS has a high mortality (~35%)associated with severe lung disease. Similar to the SARS virus that caused an epidemicin 2003-4 there is ongoing global concern due to MERS high fatality rate. To datecases of MERS have been reported in 26 countries. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4CD26) is the receptor for MERS-CoV. Epidemiologic studies have established thatMERS is zoonotic in origin with evidence for a closely related virus in dromedary camelson the Arabian peninsula and throughout Africa. Spread from camels to people isdocumented as well as person-to-person spread among health care workers in hospitalsettings. A lack of autopsy studies from MERS fatalities has hindered understanding ofMERS-CoV pathogenesis. Thus MERS is the most recent confirmation thatcoronaviruses can jump from their animal hosts infect humans and cause severedisease of global significance. There is a pressing need to better understand MERSdisease pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and therapies. There are 3 specific aims.Aim 1. To understand how an in vivo evolved MERS-CoV causes lethal lungdisease. We developed mice that have the human receptor for MERS-CoV. Using theseanimals we developed a mouse-adapted virus that causes significant lung disease.These studies will advance our knowledge of the causes of MERS-related lung disease.Aim 2. To investigate how adaptive mutations in MERS-CoV contribute toincreased virulence. We sequenced the mouse-adapted virus strains and assembledtheir genomes. We will use this genetic information to investigate relationships betweenthe virus gene products and the host responses that lead to severe lung disease.Aim 3. To investigate how DPP4 abundance and function influence MERS diseasepathogenesis. DPP4 has enzymatic activity that cleaves two amino acids off of targetprotein substrates thereby changing protein functions. DPP4 abundance and enzymaticactivity may contribute to disease. These experiments will advance our knowledge ofhow DPP4 activities may underlie to disease outcomes.","Acute;Adenovirus Vector;Africa;Alveolar;Amino Acids;Animal Model;Animals;Autopsy;Binding;Blood Vessels;Bone Marrow;Brain;Camels;Cell Communication;Cell model;Cells;Central Nervous System Diseases;Chemicals;Chimera organism;Cleaved cell;Codon Nucleotides;Coronavirus;Coronavirus Infections;Country;Cytokeratin 18;Dendritic Cells;Dipeptides;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV;Disease;Disease Outcome;Dromedaries;Edema;Engineering;Epidemic;Evolution;Exons;Fatality rate;Genome;Growth Factor;Health Personnel;Hematopoietic;Hospitals;Human;Immune response;Infection;Infiltration;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;Innate Immune Response;Interferons;K-18 conjugate;Knock-in;Knock-in Mouse;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Literature;Lung;Lung diseases;Lung infections;Lymphatic;Lymphocyte;Marrow;Mediating;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Modeling;Modification;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Patients;Persons;Phenotype;Pleural;Pneumonia;Population;Proteins;Recombinants;Reporting;Role;SARS coronavirus;Serial Passage;Serum;Specimen;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Surface;Thrombosis;Transgenic Organisms;Tropism;Vaccines;Vascular Endothelium;Virulence;Virulent;Virus;Virus Replication;Zoonoses;airway epithelium;alveolar epithelium;base;cell type;chemokine;comorbidity;coronavirus receptor;cytokine;disease phenotype;epidemiology study;experimental study;gene product;genetic information;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;interest;macrophage;mortality;mouse model;novel coronavirus;novel therapeutic intervention;pathogen;promoter;protein function;receptor;transcriptome sequencing;vaccine development;virology","Project-003","n/a","NIAID","10229392","7/23/2021","PAR-13-254","5P01AI060699-15","5","P01","AI","060699","15","","","7/1/2004","7/31/2023","ZAI1-AMC-M","8464","1961843","MCCRAY, PAUL B","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021","7/31/2022"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," ","340075"," ","223000","117075"," "," ",

Furtherrecognition of this respiratory syndrome and prevention strategies will require a smallanimal infection model as well as an additional understanding of the virus. This PPGdescribes a mouse model of MERS-CoV disease. In this model the viruses causingdisease are adapted variants specialized for mouse lung infection. By contrast non-adapted MERS-CoVs cause infection in the mouse but do not cause disease. Thecentral hypothesis of this subproject (PPG2) is that mouse-adapted variants canefficiently enter host cells through pathways that are not available to the non-adaptedviruses. To address this hypothesis recombinant MERS-CoVs will be constructed andevaluated to determine whether mouse-adaptive mutations in the cell entry-mediatingviral spike proteins correlate with efficient mouse lung infection. Surrogate MERS-CoVpseudo-viruses will be constructed and evaluated to address the focused hypothesis thatmouse adapted variants mediate an early plasma-membrane cell entry that isunavailable to non-adapted viruses. The project will dissect mechanisms by which spikeproteins mediate early cell entry through plasma membranes versus late cell entrythrough endosomes. The basis for selection of early versus late cell entry will bedetermined by identifying host cell factors promoting or restricting either pathway. Thisproject will also identify appropriate antiviral strategies that operate by preventing earlyand late virus-cell entry. The rationale for all of these aims is that additionalunderstanding of MERS-CoV cell entry pathways will identify correlates of robustinfection and disease and will also provide insights on the best ways to prevent infectionand disease with innovative virus entry inhibitors.","Acute;Address;Adenoviruses;Adhesions;Affect;Animals;Antiviral Agents;Automobile Driving;Binding;Camels;Cell Communication;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell membrane;Cells;Cleaved cell;Coronavirus;Coronavirus spike protein;Dipeptidyl Peptidases;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Endosomes;Enzymes;Epidemic;Evolution;Exhibits;Future;Genes;Human;Infection;Infection prevention;Lipids;Location;Lung infections;Measures;Mediating;Membrane Fusion;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Modeling;Mouse Protein;Mus;Mutation;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptides;Phenotype;Prevalence;Prevention strategy;Procedures;Process;Protease Inhibitor;Proteins;Quarantine;RNA Interference;Receptor Cell;Recombinants;Research;Resistance;SARS coronavirus;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome;Structure;Syndrome;Variant;Viral;Viral Proteins;Virulence;Virus;Zoonoses;adduct;base;cell type;comorbidity;coronavirus receptor;human disease;human pathogen;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;interest;late endosome;mouse model;pressure;prevent;respiratory;reverse genetics;transmission process;vaccine development;vector;viral transmission;virology","Adaptive MERS coronavirus-cell entry pathways and their relevance to virulence and antiviral strategies","n/a","NIAID","10229391","7/23/2021","PAR-13-254","5P01AI060699-15","5","P01","AI","060699","15","","","7/1/2004","7/31/2023","ZAI1-AMC-M","6208","1862621","GALLAGHER, THOMAS MILLER","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021","7/31/2022"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," ","266291"," ","266291","0"," "," ",

Disease is especiallysevere in aged populations. In the previous funding period we showed that age-dependent increasesin prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and an upstream phospholipase A2 PLA2G2D contributed to poorimmune responses and decreased survival. The lung is in a state of chronic inflammation resultingfrom continued exposure to environmental antigens. We postulated that PLA2G2D which has anti-inflammatory properties is upregulated to counter this low grade inflammation resulting in delayedresponses to innocuous antigens but also to rapidly replicating viruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In contrast genetic absence of DP1 the PGD2 receptor on myeloid cells appears to result inpoor respiratory dendritic cell activation suggesting that PGD2-DP1 signaling may have pro-inflammatory properties at early times after infection. Our central hypothesis is that small lipidmediators are major factors in the inflammatory milieu in the lung affecting many aspects of theimmune response to MERS-CoV SARS-CoV and other respiratory pathogens. This hypothesis will beapproached in the following specific aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of PLA2G2D upregulationand the role of PLA2G2D in vaccine responses in 12m old mice. CoV replication includes extensivecellular membrane rearrangements. The role between these rearrangements the induction of oxidativestress and the upregulation of PLA2G2D will be investigated. 2. To determine the role of PGD2-DP1signaling in the immune response to SARS-CoV in 12 m mice. The absence of PGD2-DP1 signalingresults in diminished rDC activation and type I IFN (IFN-I) expression and increased inflammasomeactivation. Our goal is to determine whether changes in inflammasome activation are the majorpathogenic effect of absent PGD2-DP1 signaling or if other factors are also involved. 3. To determinewhether disease severity in murine MERS is age-dependent and whether PGD2 and PLA2G2Dcontribute to poorer outcomes. Using our newly developed hDPP4-KI mice and mouse-adaptedMERS-CoV we will determine whether MERS-CoV in mice also causes an age-dependent disease.We will also assess whether changes in eicosanoid expression contribute to more severe disease.MERS-CoV unlike SARS-CoV productively infects macrophages. In this aim we will determinewhether productive infection of human and murine macrophages modulates PLA2G2D expression.","Affect;Age;Age-Years;Aging;Alveolar Macrophages;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antigens;Case Fatality Rates;Cell Communication;Cells;Cellular Membrane;Chronic;Collaborations;Coronavirus Infections;Dendritic Cells;Dendritic cell activation;Dependence;Depressed mood;Dinoprostone;Disease;Dopamine D2 Receptor;Eicosanoids;Elderly;Exposure to;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Human;ITGAX gene;Immune response;Individual;Infection;Inflammasome;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interferons;Knock-in Mouse;Lung;Lung diseases;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Outcome;Oxidative Stress Induction;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Phospholipase;Phospholipase A2;Property;Prostaglandin D2;Prostaglandins;Respiratory Tract Infections;Role;SARS coronavirus;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome;Severity of illness;Signal Transduction;System;T cell response;Time;Up-Regulation;Vaccines;Viral;Virulent;Virus;age related;aged;aging population;cell motility;draining lymph node;inflammatory milieu;lipid mediator;macrophage;member;middle age;mortality;pathogen;receptor;respiratory;respiratory pathogen;response;vaccine development;vaccine response;vaccine trial;virology","Project 1","n/a","NIAID","10229390","7/23/2021","PAR-13-254","5P01AI060699-15","5","P01","AI","060699","15","","","7/1/2004","7/31/2023","ZAI1-AMC-M","6207","1902986","PERLMAN, STANLEY ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2021","7/31/2022"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," ","79983"," ","52448","27535"," "," ",

"No NIH Category available","OVERVIEW-SUMMARYThe emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-3 and the Middle EastRespiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 demonstrates that zoonotic coronaviruses (CoV) have and willlikely continue to spread from zoonotic sources to infect human populations. MERS-CoV continues tocirculate in camels and to spread to susceptible humans highlighting the need to better understandthe pathogenesis of diseases mediated by pathogenic human respiratory CoV. In this PPGinvestigators with experience in coronavirus pathogenesis molecular biology immunology andvaccinology will work together to understand how virus factors and dysregulated innate and adaptiveimmune responses contribute to MERS and SARS disease in young and aged animals and in animalswith co-morbidities. All of the projects will utilize newly developed mice expressing human MERSreceptor (DPP4) in lieu of the mouse receptor (hDPP4-KI) and a mouse-virulent MERS-CoV selectedin these mice (MERSMA). Project 1 will use MERSMA to investigate the role of aging in infected mice.Project 1 is also based on published data showing that specific eiconsanoids with anti-inflammatoryproperites and their upstream phopholipases increase during aging contributing to a delayed immuneresponse after SARS-CoV (and by extension perhaps MERSMA) infection. Project 2 is based onpreliminary data showing that MERS-CoV has a greater dependence on host cell proteases for virusentry than does SARS-CoV. This project will investigate unique mutations found in the surface (S)glycoprotein of MERSMA that appear to affect protease function. Project 3 will investigate howMERSMA causes more severe disease than the initial human EMC/2012 strain with focus on theORF4b accessory protein. This project will also investigate how hDPP4 contributes to diseaseseverity. Project 4 is based on published data showing that the CoV E protein has ion channel activityis a virulence factor and contains a PDZ binding domain (PBM) which is critical for virus viability. Thisproject will focus on how the E protein causes edema in lungs and on the role of the PBM inpathogenesis. A novel PBM in the C terminal of E arose in MERSMA during mouse passage and itsrole will be studied. This project will also continue to develop safe live attenuated MERS and SARSvaccines. All of the projects will use the Animal/Virology Core which will provide nonrecombinant andrecombinant MERS-CoV and SARS-CoVs and will monitor and analyze infected mice. Using the Corefor these purposes will maximize experimental quality control and effective use of our resources.These projects are all interrelated and collaborative will take advantage of the unique skills andexpertise of the project directors and provide new information about MERS and SARS pathogenesisthat is essential to vaccine development.","Address;Affect;Age;Aging;Animal Model;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antiviral Therapy;Area;Attenuated;Attenuated Vaccines;Binding;Biology;C-terminal;Camels;Cell Communication;Cells;Chiroptera;Collaborations;Coronavirus;Data;Dependence;Development;Disease;E protein;Edema;Eicosanoids;Future;Genes;Goals;Human;Immune response;Immunology;Infection;Ion Channel;Knock-in Mouse;Knowledge;Lung;Lung diseases;Lung infections;Mediating;Membrane Glycoproteins;Methods;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Molecular Virology;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Population;Positioning Attribute;Program Research Project Grants;Proteins;Publishing;Pulmonary Pathology;Quality Control;Recombinants;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;SARS coronavirus;Sampling;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome;Severity of illness;Source;Surface;System;Vaccines;Viral Proteins;Virulence;Virulence Factors;Virulent;Virus;Work;Zoonoses;adaptive immune response;aged;base;biological research;comorbidity;experience;innovation;lipid mediator;mouse model;novel;novel vaccines;pathogenic virus;programs;receptor;recombinant virus;respiratory;respiratory infection virus;reverse genetics;skills;tool;transmission process;vaccine candidate;vaccine development;vaccinology;virology;zoonotic coronavirus","PPG: SARS-CoV-host cell interactions and vaccine development","OVERVIEW-NARRATIVEThe overarching goal of this Program Project Grant is to increase understanding of severe pulmonaryinfections caused by MERS-CoV SARS-CoV and by extension other respiratory viral pathogens inyoung and aged animals.

"Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Contraception/Reproduction; Infant Mortality; Maternal Health; Nanotechnology; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Women's Health","Project Summary/Abstract: Spontaneous preterm labor (PTL <37 weeks gestation) is the leading cause of neonatal and infantmortality globally representing ~60% of all infant deaths. The physiopathology of PTL remains poorlyunderstood due to the heterogeneities associated with the risk factors including maternal age multiplegestation and co-morbidities among others. Current clinical standard to identify women at high risk of PTLinclude cervical length assessment and screening for fetal fibronectin in the cervicovaginal fluid. Howeverthese approaches are inadequate and often fail to identify women who may deliver preterm. Recent patientmetadata studies have identified multiple biomarkers correlated to PTL but risk scoring based on singlebiomarkers has shown low positive predictive values and have been ineffective in PTL prediction. Thescientific premise of the proposed study is that there is an urgent clinical need for accurate diagnostics withmultiplexed biomarker detection capabilities that are simultaneously affordable to facilitate routine bedsidescreening for all patients. Further by benchmarking the biodiagnostic against commercial assays using thesame sample type from the same patients will minimize inter- and intra-assay variation which remains achallenge in current bedside diagnostics. The objective of this study is to address this unmet need with an innovative biodiagnostic PRADAwhich combines high sensitivity specificity multiplexing use of low sample volumes and low cost. PRADAportable reusable accurate diagnostics with nanoantennas consists of magnetic microbeads capture probesfunctionalized with polyclonal antibodies and near-infrared resonant gold nanostar antennas barcoded withRaman tags and labeled with peptides to detect the biomarkers via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy(SERS). PRADA has successfully demonstrated multiplexed detection of 3 PTL biomarkers including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulatingfactor (GM-CSF) in pregnant patient serum. PRADA achieved ultrasensitive limit of detection (LOD 1.7 pg/mlGM-CSF) ideal for risk stratification and when compared to commercial Luminex and ELISA PRADA showedfar lower LODs. Further PRADA is also reusable (due to the use of magnetic beads) lowering the overall costby allowing >15 uses of a single microfluidic device. This work will leverage innovative PRADA toquantitatively detect 6 serum biomarkers which are the most predictive of PTL including C-reactive protein(CRP) AFP IL-10 IL-6 CRH and GM-CSF benchmarked against Luminex and ELISA (Aim 1). Further wewill validate multiplexing with PRADA in serum of patients recruited for this study in the 18  35 years agegroup with singleton pregnancy and gestation age 19  36 weeks (Aim 2). A maternal risk score will beestablished categorizing patients into high and low risk groups and the scoring will be compared to theirexisting diagnosis to determine the accuracy of PRADA.

Our prior research has demonstrated that the enteric pathome - i.e. the communities of viral bacterial and protozoan pathogens transmitted by human and animal feces in the environment - ingested by children living in low-income urban neighborhoods of Kenya is taxonomically complex and varies by exposure pathway. Our preliminary data indicates that the risk of multi-pathogen infection is elevated among those 6- month old Kenyan infants fed cows milk and living in urban households with dirt floors shared latrines and cohabitating domestic animals. This suggests multiple aspects of societal development beyond latrines and water sources are required to reduce complexity in pathogen transmission in high burden countries. We hypothesize that joint modeling of enteric pathome agents across households and neighborhoods that represent contrasts in urban societal development will show that development leads to pathome evolution from complex to simple community structures and thus lower detection frequencies for individual pathogen taxa. Understanding the evolution in pathome complexity induced by societal development and subsequently identifying effective intervention strategies is challenging since field experiments are expensive to implement difficult to generalize to other settings are only informed by existing limited observational data and sufficiently sophisticated statistical and mathematical pathome modeling tools are not currently available. Our proposal aims to (1) develop spatiotemporal and trajectory statistical models to understand the complex exposure risks for infants from the enteric pathome; (2) collect environmental behavioral spatial economic and microbial data to characterize the enteric pathome along pathways for disease diffusion and the intersection of humans and animals with these pathways; and (3) develop and validate agent-based models (ABMs) for predicting which social and environmental urban developmental interventions (e.g. animal penning building latrines or drains concrete floors) best prevent multipathogen transmission to infants in high disease burden countries using established Kenyan study sites as a model.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Gene regulatory evolution is a major driver for phenotypic divergence. While this has been well-studied indevelopment its importance in non-developmental processes is far less understood. The overall visionof the lab is to fully characterize the evolutionary rewiring of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) formajor stress responses in opportunistic yeast pathogens and elucidate the contribution of suchchanges to the survival and virulence in the host. The lab previously discovered a significant differencein how a commensal and opportunistic yeast pathogen Candida glabrata regulates its PhosphateStarvation (PHO) response compared with its non-commensal relative Saccharomyces cerevisiae: thecommensal has dramatically expanded its PHO response targets both in number and in function whichwas attributed to derived changes in its master transcription factor (TF) by being less dependent on theco-TF. The goal of the lab in the next five years is to determine the genetic and mechanistic bases of thisnovel mode of TF evolution i.e. acquiring new targets by reducing co-TF dependence and the effect ofsuch evolution on stress resistance to phosphate starvation as well as combinatorial stresses in the host.Understanding how this model stress response evolved by itself and in its interaction with other stressresponses will begin to elucidate the principles for stress response evolution in commensal yeasts ingeneral. To reach this goal three Directions will be pursued: 1) Elucidate the mechanisms of a novel modeof TF evolution and its impact on the downstream response using biophysical and fitness assays; 2)Dissect the crosstalk between stress responses and how it evolved in commensal yeasts by determiningthe interaction of PHO response with oxidative stress and general stress responses in C. glabrata and S.cerevisiae; 3) Determine how the PHO network evolved in other commensal yeasts and related non-commensals using transcriptome profiling coupled with genome-wide Chromatin-IP. Research proposedin this application is innovative because the evolutionary approach will identify key changes in the wiringof the stress response GRNs underlying host adaptation. The proposed research is significant because itwill both shed light on the general principles for GRN evolution and will provide a conceptual frameworkfor developing novel antifungal strategies targeting stress responses.","Antifungal Agents;Basic Science;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biophysics;Candida;Candida glabrata;Chromatin;Coupled;Dependence;Development;Evolution;Foundations;Future;Genetic;Goals;Knowledge;Light;Mission;Modeling;National Institute of General Medical Sciences;Opportunistic Infections;Oxidative Stress;Phenotype;Public Health;Regulator Genes;Research;Resistance;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Starvation;Stress;Virulence;Vision;Yeasts;base;biological adaptation to stress;combinatorial;fitness;genome-wide;innovation;inorganic phosphate;novel;opportunistic pathogen;pathogen;pathogenic fungus;response;transcription factor;transcriptome","Evolution of Stress Response Gene Regulatory Network in a Commensal and Opportunistic Yeast Pathogen","The proposed research is relevant to public health because it represents a new and alternative strategyto the urgent threat of infections by opportunistic fungal pathogens like the Candida spp. By focusing onhow the stress response regulatory networks in the commensal yeast diverged from related non-commensal relatives this research will generate novel foundational knowledge on the adaptivestrategies and potential weaknesses of the opportunistic pathogens which will enable the futureidentification of novel antifungal strategies.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT 3ABSTRACTIt is often assumed that CF lung disease begins in the small airways. While a numberof observations suggest this assumption is correct we do not have direct experimentalevidence. Because we have more knowledge of host defense defects in large CFairways we might conjecture that the abnormalities in small CF airways are the same.However differences in epithelial morphology cell types and lack of submucosalglands and continuous cartilages suggest that small airways are not simply smalllarge airways. The small airways have been relatively inaccessible for detailedmechanistic studies. As a result we lack answers to many key questions. What isthe airway surface liquid pH in CF small airways? How is it controlled? Whatmechanism secretes protons into small airways? Is mucociliary transport disrupted insmall airways? Is the activity of ASL antimicrobials impaired? Is CFTR in small airwayssufficient to prevent CF lung disease? As CF lung disease progresses how do hostdefenses and disease in small airways change? Our overarching hypothesis is thatlack of CFTR in the small airway is pivotal for the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.We will investigate 3 specific aims:Specific Aim 1. Does lack of CFTR in small airways result in host defense defects?Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that newborn CF small airways will bemore acidic and will have an impairment in host defenses.Specific Aim 2. Does V-ATPase play a role in regulating small airways airway surfaceliquid pH? We hypothesize that V-ATPase is expressed on the apical surface of aspecific cell type of small airway epithelial cells and plays a role in a feedbackmechanism that regulates ASL pH.Specific Aim 3. Will CFTR expression in small airways of prevent CF pig lungdisease? We will use a novel AAV vector to selectively express CFTR in the smallairway epithelial cells of CF pigs. We will investigate the effect of restoration of CFTRfunction on manifestations of early lung.Answers to these questions will guide the field in understanding the contribution ofsmall airways to disease and in identifying strategies for better treatments of CF.","ATP12A gene;Affect;Air;Airway Disease;Apical;Cartilage;Clinical;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Disease;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Family suidae;Feedback;Gene Expression Profile;Gland;Host Defense;Immune;Impairment;Inflammation;Knowledge;Lung;Lung diseases;Morphology;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Natural Immunity;Newborn Infant;Pathogenesis;Physiology;Play;Protein Isoforms;Proton-Translocating ATPases;Protons;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Regulation;Role;Surface;Viral Respiratory Tract Infection;Virus;adeno-associated viral vector;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;base;cell type;cystic fibrosis airway;early cystic fibrosis;intervention effect;novel;prevent;restoration;selective expression;vacuolar H+-ATPase;vector","Project 3: Contribution of Small Airways to Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease Pathogenesis","PROJECT 3NARRATIVEWe assume that CF lung disease begins in the small airways but we do not have experimentalevidence.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT 2PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTLoss of the CFTR anion channel causes cystic fibrosis (CF) which is characterized by bacterial infection andinflammation. To understand how CF disrupts airway defenses we generated CF pigs and found that on theday they are born they have impaired respiratory host defenses. Within weeks they spontaneously develophallmarks of CF airways: infection inflammation remodeling mucus accumulation and obstruction. Studies ofCF pigs revealed at least two respiratory host defense defects: reduced activity of antimicrobials in airwaysurface liquid and impaired mucociliary transport. Both defects are caused at least in part by an abnormallyacidic airway liquid. Loss of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate secretion leaves unchecked acid secretion thatreduces pH. We found that a proton pump (ATP12A) is responsible for secreting acid into the airways. Theoverarching goal of this project is to understand how ATP12A acid secretion impairs host defense and whetherthe acidic pH causes CF lung disease. The project addresses three main questions. First how is ATP12Aacid secretion regulated in CF airways? Understanding the control of ATP12A is important because varyingthe rate of H+ secretion will change pH which could exacerbate or attenuate disease severity. Second what isthe pH in the lumen of submucosal glands? Submucosal glands produce most of the airway mucus. Earlierwork showed that mucus emerging from CF submucosal glands ducts sometimes failed to break free from theduct which impaired mucociliary transport. Those discoveries and knowledge that an acidic pH increasesmucus elasticity make it imperative to know the pH in the submucosal gland lumen. This proposal developsnovel means to obtain that information. Third does disrupting the ATP12A gene rescue CF defects? CF pigsthat have a disrupted ATP12A gene will allow a test of the hypotheses that preventing acid secretion willincrease pH in the submucosal gland lumen improve mucociliary transport and prevent CF lung disease. Thisresearch will allow us to better understand how CF alters pH in the submucosal gland lumen and at the airwaysurface thereby disrupting respiratory host defenses. The knowledge of CF pathogenesis will acceleratediscovery of novel therapies and cures for this lethal disease.","ATP12A gene;Acid-Base Equilibrium;Acidity;Acids;Acinus organ component;Address;Airway Disease;Anions;Attenuated;Bacterial Infections;Bicarbonates;Birth;Cells;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Disease;Duct (organ) structure;Elasticity;Family suidae;Gel;Genetic Diseases;Gland;Goals;H(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase;Host Defense;Impairment;Infection;Inflammation;Knowledge;Learning;Link;Liquid substance;Lung diseases;Measurement;Mediating;Modification;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Obstruction;Pathogenesis;Property;Proton Pump;Protons;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Research;Respiratory physiology;Serous;Serum;Severity of illness;Site;Surface;Testing;Viral Respiratory Tract Infection;Viscosity;Work;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;apical membrane;base;cystic fibrosis airway;improved;infancy;loss of function;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;prevent;respiratory;vesicular release","Project 2: Contribution of a Non-Gastric Proton Pump to Airway Acidification Respiratory Host Defense and Lung Disease in Cystic Fibrosis","PROJECT 2PROJECT NARRATIVEThe control of acid base balance in airways is critical for normal respiratory function and fordefense against infection.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT 1PROJECT SUMMARYDespite the development of new therapies cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life-shortening disease. Earlyinterventions aimed at correcting the initial host defense defects and preventing/reducing infection and mucusaccumulation could dramatically improve the course of CF lung disease. It is widely known that mutations inthe gene encoding the HCO3- and Cl--conducting channel CFTR cause CF; in spite of this knowledge lack ofan animal model that replicates human CF has obscured the origins of disease. CF pigs provided us with theunprecedented opportunity to investigate the CF lung at very early time points. At birth CF pigs lack airwaydisease but within weeks of birth CF pigs spontaneously develop hallmark features of CF lung diseaseincluding airway inflammation infection mucus accumulation and remodeling. We previously found that CFpigs have at least two host defense defects on the day that they are born: a) reduced activity of airway surfaceliquid antimicrobials; and b) defective mucociliary transport (MCT) following cholinergic stimulation whichelicits copious mucus secretion from submucosal glands. Recent mechanistic investigations revealed that CFsubmucosal glands secrete strands of mucus that sometimes do not break free after emerging onto the airwaysurface. Instead they remain attached to the gland ducts hindering MCT. These findings directly linkimpaired MCT to loss of anion transport indicating that defective MCT is a primary abnormality. Our centralhypothesis is that loss of CFTR causes MCT defects that contribute to early CF airway disease. Thus there isa critical need to better understand the underlying mechanism for MCT defects whether these defects areimpacted by disease progression and how they might be corrected. In a new direction for this project wefocus our studies on the mucus strands that fail to detach from the CF submucosal gland duct and concentrateour efforts towards determining if this defect is correctable. We will investigate the following Specific Aims: (1)Which factors impact mucus strand formation breakage and clearance? Our working hypothesis is thataltering the chemical environment into which mucus strands are formed and released will impact strandbreakage and clearance. (2) In CF airways does inducing release of mucus strands from submucosal glandducts restore MCT? We postulate that releasing stuck mucus strands will reverse MCT defects therebyenhancing MCT in CF. (3) How does early CF disease progression and viral infection impact MCT? CF pigshave host defense defects present at birth and within weeks of age develop airway disease. Here we willdiscover how early infection inflammation and mucus accumulation affect MCT in CF pigs. By focusing onthe pathogenesis of early CF airway disease we hope to accelerate discovery of new therapeutic interventionsand identify endpoints for early CF.","Affect;Age;Air;Airway Disease;Animal Model;Animals;Anions;Antibiotic Therapy;Bacterial Counts;Bicarbonates;Biological Assay;Birth;Chemicals;Chronic;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Duct (organ) structure;Early Intervention;Environment;Etiology;Family suidae;Genes;Genetic Diseases;Gland;Host Defense;Human;Impairment;Infection;Inflammation;Investigation;Knowledge;Life;Link;Lung;Lung diseases;Microfluidics;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mutation;Pathogenesis;Publishing;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Pulmonary Fibrosis;Reducing Agents;Respiratory Failure;Surface;Testing;Time;Vesicle;Virus Diseases;airway inflammation;airway obstruction;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;base;cholinergic;cystic fibrosis airway;early cystic fibrosis;improved;insight;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;prevent;recurrent infection;slug","Project 1: Mucociliary Transport in Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease","PROJECT 1PROJECT NARRATIVECystic fibrosis is a common life-shortening genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure due torecurrent infections and airway obstruction.

"No NIH Category available","Twenty-eight years after the discovery of the CFTR gene the causes of cystic fibrosis (CF) airwaydisease remain controversial we still lack answers to many critical questions our therapies areinadequate and CF remains a life limiting and too often lethal disease. A major impediment to progresshas been lack of CF animal models with a lung disease phenotype resembling humans with CF. Wedeveloped pigs with targeted alterations of the CFTR gene. CF pigs spontaneously develop the hallmarkfeatures of CF lung disease including airway infection inflammation airway wall remodeling mucusaccumulation and airway obstruction. Within hours of birth CF pigs fail to eradicate bacteria aseffectively as wild-type pigs. At least two host defense defects reduced antimicrobial activity in airwaysurface liquid (ASL) and impaired mucociliary transport (MCT) contribute. Both were caused byabnormally acidic airway liquid. In this Program three highly accomplished investigators will use CF pigsto answer fundamental questions about CF lung disease. Together the three projects will discover howloss of CFTR function affects: a) submucosal gland function the properties of mucus and MCT; b) ASLpH and proton secretion via ATP12A; and c) small airways function a likely site of CF diseasepathogenesis. The Project Leaders and their teams have an outstanding track record of collaborative CFresearch and here they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their highly creative research issupported by five cores that provide innovative infrastructure and services. By further educating CFpathogenesis it will accelerate discovery of novel therapies for this lethal disease.","ATP12A gene;Address;Affect;Airway Disease;Animal Model;Anions;Bacteria;Bicarbonates;Birth;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Defect;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Duct (organ) structure;Exhibits;Family suidae;Genetic Diseases;Gland;Goals;H(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase;Host Defense;Hour;Human;Impairment;Infection;Inflammation;Infrastructure;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Life;Link;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung diseases;Mediating;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Newborn Infant;Pathogenesis;Play;Property;Proton Pump;Proton-Translocating ATPases;Protons;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Regulator Genes;Research;Research Personnel;Respiratory Failure;Role;Serum;Services;Site;Surface;Techniques;Virus Diseases;airway epithelium;airway obstruction;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;cystic fibrosis airway;defined contribution;disease phenotype;early cystic fibrosis;gene discovery;injured airway;innovation;insight;mortality;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;porcine model;prevent;programs;recurrent infection;respiratory;success;vacuolar H+-ATPase","Origins of Cystic Fibrosis Airway Disease","Cystic fibrosis is a common life-shortening genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure due torecurrent infections and airway obstruction.

"Clinical Research; Infant Mortality; Lung; Neonatal Respiratory Distress; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Patient Safety; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Rare Diseases","Globally approximately 15 million babies are born preterm each year and 1.1 million deaths are due to preterm birth (PTB) defined as delivery of an infant before 37 post-menstrual weeks. Because mortality and morbidity rates are dependent upon gestational age the very preterm neonate (<32 weeks gestation) is at the highest risk of developing complications that can result in death or significant life-long disability. Among the most significant and common of the major neonatal morbidities are intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) sepsis patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). While measures of neonatal illness severity have been successful in predicting the risk for mortality in very preterm neonates our ability to identify newborns likely to develop significant morbidity remains limited. Neonatal illness severity indices have a variety of important clinical and research applications including risk stratification family counseling external benchmarking for inter-hospital performance comparisons and determining individual treatments for infants with a specific risk profile. Scoring systems are needed that not only predict mortality but also morbidity in the very preterm neonate. Our team has shown that metabolic status at the time of routine newborn screening is a novel predictor of neonatal morbidity and mortality in preterm newborns. Further work is needed to optimize these prediction models in very preterm neonates and quantify the ability of metabolites to act as strong robust and potentially longitudinal biomarkers of neonatal illness severity. We hypothesize that metabolic biomarkers can be used to accurately predict the risk of a composite outcome in very preterm neonates that includes neonatal morbidity and in-hospital mortality. The objectives of our study are: Aim 1: Develop and externally validate metabolic models for predicting neonatal morbidity in very preterm newborns; and Aim 2: Evaluate dynamic metabolic models for predicting neonatal morbidity at multiple time points within the first week of life. The proposed work will examine metabolic predictors of neonatal morbidity and mortality in a retrospective sample of approximately 8500 very preterm births from California and 1500 very preterm births from Iowa. Furthermore we will evaluate the ability of metabolites to predict neonatal morbidity and mortality at four critical time points within the first week of life in a prospective sample of 500 very preterm newborns receiving care in the NICU at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital (UCSF-BCH) and the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital (UI-SFCH). Understanding the relationship between specific metabolites and neonatal morbidity will lead to the long-term goal of improved diagnostics more effective therapeutic agents and a precision approach to clinical management of the very preterm neonate.","10 year old;37 weeks gestation;Address;Benchmarking;Biological;Biological Markers;Birth;Brain Death;Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia;California;Caring;Cerebral Palsy;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Climacteric;Clinical;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Counseling;Data;Decision Making;Diagnostic;Disease;Etiology;Family;Gestational Age;Goals;Hospital Mortality;Hour;Individual;Infant;Infant Care;Infant Mortality;Intervention;Iowa;Lead;Life;Life Experience;Measures;Metabolic;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Necrotizing Enterocolitis;Neonatal;Neonatal Intensive Care Units;Neonatal Mortality;Neonatal Screening;Neurodevelopmental Impairment;Newborn Infant;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patent Ductus Arteriosus;Pattern;Pediatric Hospitals;Periventricular Leukomalacia;Physiology;Pregnancy;Premature Birth;Premature Infant;Protocols documentation;Research;Retinopathy of Prematurity;Risk;Sampling;Sepsis;Severity of Illness Index;Severity of illness;System;Therapeutic Agents;Time;United States;Universities;Variant;Vulnerable Populations;Work;base;clinical care;clinical practice;cost estimate;disability;hemodynamics;high risk;hospital performance;improved;intraventricular hemorrhage;late onset sepsis;medical complication;metabolic profile;mortality;mortality risk;neonatal morbidity;neonate;novel;patient population;personalized approach;predictive modeling;preterm newborn;prospective;research clinical testing;risk prediction model;risk stratification;therapeutically effective","Targeted metabolic profiling to predict major morbidity in very preterm newborns","The very preterm neonate is at risk for a discrete set of medical complications due to their unique physiology and vulnerability.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/AbstractThe PIs laboratory studies cell mechanobiology at the molecular tension level. Force is essential for the life ofcells. Integrin-transmitted cellular force at the cell-matrix interface mechanically drives short-term cellularfunctions such as cell adhesion contraction and migration. In long term cellular force is also transduced tobiochemical signals to regulate cell proliferation differentiation cancer cell metastasis etc. Because of itsfundamental importance integrin-transmitted cellular force has been extensively studied at the bulk level by thewell-developed cell traction force microscopies. However integrin tension the force transmitted by individualintegrin molecules despite its fundamental role in integrin signaling is much less understood in most cellularfunctions. The PIs lab specializes in studying cell mechanobiology using innovative molecular tension tools thatmeasure map and manipulate integrin tension in live cells. A tension sensor named ITS was developed by thePI to convert integrin tension to fluorescent signal and enable integrin tension mapping directly by fluorescenceimaging with high spatial resolution. A tension modulator named TGT was developed to quantitatively restrictintegrin tension in whole cells under a designed level for the study of regulative role of integrin tension in specificcellular functions. With these tools the PIs lab initiated the study of integrin tension in migrating cells plateletsand micro-sized invadopodia of cancer cells. The preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility andversatility of these integrin tension tools in the research of cell mechanobiology at the molecular tension level.With these innovative tension tools the elusive integrin tension can now be visualized quantified and controlledalong with cell structure and biochemical factors in live cells with comparable resolution sensitivity and precision.In next five years the PIs lab will study the correlation co-localization and causality among integrin tension cellstructure and local biochemical activities in live cells. The MIRA fund provides the PIs lab with the flexibility tocontinue the study of integrin tension in three distinct cellular processes. The PI will combine molecular tensiontools genetic methods and fluorescence imaging to investigate the range source distribution and function ofintegrin tension in migrating cells and reveal how cells exert and control integrin tension locally to coordinatecell protrusion and retraction. For platelet study the force source and biological function of integrin tension duringplatelet adhesion contraction and aggregation will be investigated in both 2D and 3D contexts. The integrintension map will also be tested as a diagnostic assay for the assessment of platelet activity in stemming bleeding.For invadopodium study the role of integrin tension in invadopodium formation and matrix degradation duringcancer cell invasion will be comprehensively investigated. The proposed research will reveal valuable insightsto the fundamental role of integrin tension in these various cellular processes. This project will also provide thefield with innovative molecular tension sensor and tension modulator that are expected to be widely useful forcellular force study with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity.","3-Dimensional;Adhesions;Biochemical;Biological Process;Blood Platelets;Cell Adhesion;Cell Proliferation;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Structures;Correlation Studies;Etiology;Foundations;Funding;Generations;Genetic;Health;Hemorrhage;Human;Individual;Integrins;Laboratory Study;Lead;Life;Maps;Measures;Methods;Molecular;Names;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathology;Physiological;Regulation;Research;Resolution;Role;Signal Transduction;Source;Testing;Traction Force Microscopy;cancer cell;cell motility;design;diagnostic assay;experimental study;flexibility;fluorescence imaging;human disease;innovation;insight;mechanical drive;migration;platelet function;sensor;stem;tool","Study the role of integrin tension in cell migration platelet contraction and invadopodium dynamics","Project NarrativeIntegrins and integrin-transmitted cellular force are critical for many cellular and physiological functions whichare the foundation of human health.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases","Abstract/Summary (Pilot Program)The main goal of the proposed Center's Pilot Program is to foster the career development of juniorinvestigators carrying out research in the field of cystic fibrosis (CF). A secondary goal is to attract more seniorinvestigators from outside the field into areas of CF research. One mechanism that has been key to achievingthese goals is our Pilot Program which provides seed money for research that has not yet reached the stageof maturity necessary to garner funding through traditional NIH mechanisms. During the 21 years that the P30Pilot Program has been running it has funded 66 pilots in areas of CF research and other genetic diseases.Numerous junior investigators funded through this program have gone onto develop independent and wellfunded research programs. Prior to 2014 P30 Pilots included other genetic diseases and after that they wererequired to be focused on CF (including lung). In keeping with the overall shift of the Center's focus for thisfunding cycle revisions to the Pilot Program include a requirement for the research to be focused on CFresearch related to the NIDDK mission (i.e. excluding lung). The Pilot Program is run through the Center'sAdministrative Core with oversight from three committees: the Pilot and Feasibility Committee the ExecutiveCommittee and the External Advisory Committee. These groups take into account two external reviews perapplication in making decisions about funding.

ThisP30 Core facility was established at the time of the last renewal due to the increasing need for organizedbiobanking of CF and non-CF control specimens and the increasing involvement of Center Members in clinicalstudies seeking to ask basic scientific questions in humans and compare these findings to the CF mouseferret and pig models. Major objectives of the core include assistance in recruiting and identifying patientssuitable for various investigator-driven CF clinical trials and studies. This Core functions under the umbrella ofthe Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) and will benefit from its resources and support fortranslational clinical research.The main goals of the Core are: 1. To sustain an umbrella biobank to archive biosamples collected during routine clinical visits and research-related visits and to obtain consent from current and future CF patients for this biobank. 2. To acquire normal and CF specimens including DNA bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) whole blood plasma feces urine and bacterial isolates. 3. To maintain databases of historical clinical samples and prospectively collected samples including molecular typing of bacterial and other isolates when available. 4. To support a standardized process through which investigators can obtain de-identified or identified clinical information about archived clinical samples or prospectively obtained samples from routine clinical bloodwork (e.g. samples from oral glucose tolerance testing or routine liver function monitoring) 5. To assist basic and translational researchers in obtaining specific biological samples that are not routinely banked (e.g. surgical discarded specimens such as the gallbladder followingcholecystectomy). 6. To facilitate patient recruitment and enrollment in clinical trials and studies particularly early phase trials of novel therapies and mechanistic or pathophysiology studies. 7. To assist investigators in conducting clinical trials and preparing IRB submissions and to ensure that clinical research is conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and appropriate biostatistical analysis.","Animal Model;Archives;Area;Bacterial Typing;Basic Science;Biological;Biometry;Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid;Cholecystectomy;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Sciences;Clinical Trials;Collection;Conduct Clinical Trials;Consent;Core Facility;Cystic Fibrosis;DNA;Databases;Disease;Ensure;Faculty;Feces;Ferrets;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Gallbladder;Goals;Good Clinical Practice;Human;Informed Consent;Infrastructure;Institutes;Institutional Review Boards;Intervention Studies;Investigator-Initiated Research;Medicine;Molecular;Monitor;Nature;OGTT;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathology;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Plasma;Procedures;Process;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Sampling;Specific qualifier value;Specimen;Standardization;System;Time;Translating;Translational Research;Urine;Visit;Whole Blood;Work;biobank;biological specimen archives;central database;clinical care;clinical encounter;college;cystic fibrosis mouse;cystic fibrosis patients;design;early phase trial;gene therapy;human subject;liver function;member;novel therapeutics;participant enrollment;porcine model;prospective;ranpirnase;recruit;sample collection;support network;translational scientist","Clinical Core-Core 6","n/a","NIDDK","10225753","6/22/2021","RFA-DK-19-003","5P30DK054759-22","5","P30","DK","054759","22","","","9/30/1998","3/31/2025","ZDK1-GRB-M","8180","10384704","LARSON ODE, KATIE MARIE ULRING","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","112321"," ","72700","39621"," "," ",

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","Abstract/Summary (Animal Models CoreCore 3)Animal models of cystic fibrosis (CF) are critical for the development of effective molecular therapies. Inparticular animal models that reproduce the clinical manifestations of CF are necessary for elucidating thepathophysiologically relevant cellular targets for gene therapy and aid in the development and testing of bothgene and cell therapies for CF. The Animal Models Core (AMC) provides support to investigators who useanimal models to study CF pathogenesis as well as to those who develop molecular therapies for CF.Specifically it provides centralized production care breeding genotyping and quality control of CF mouseand ferret models used by Center investigators. Additionally the AMC has served as a conduit for thedissemination of CF pig tissue specimens from other funded programs in the Carver College of Medicine.However because of the high cost of maintaining CF pigs the AMC has not established its own colonyinstead relying on two established PPGs directed by Drs. Stoltz and McCray to gain access to pig samples.The AMC also assists in the management of BSL2 containment and compliance in animal experimentsinvolving recombinant viruses. Technicians within the Core perform the more technically challenging aspects ofstudies in CF animal models such as administering viral vectors glucose clamps mixed meal tolerance testsand oral glucose tolerance tests as well as testing of drugs and harvesting tissue. Recently the AMC wasinstrumental in developing new methods of genetic engineering involving the CRISPR/Cas9 system. This newtechnology circumvents the need for somatic cell nuclear transfer in the generation of ferret models and hasenabled the creation of ROSA26 knock-in Cre-reporter ferrets cell-specific IRES-CreERT2 driver knock-inferrets and conditional CFTR-knockout ferrets. These new lines are enabling Center Members to trace thefates of endocrine progenitors in the CF pancreas and to study CFTR function in specific cell populations.Together with a CFTRG551D ferret generated and characterized during the last funding period these lines areexpected to lead to considerable expansion of the services the AMC provides to the research community.During the last 5 years the AMC greatly increased its dissemination of CF ferret tissue to investigators servingover 70 researchers at or outside UI and disseminating over 3000 specimens enabling cost-effective broaduse of the model. The majority of AMC effort is directed toward CF gene therapy and CF pathophysiologyproviding extensive support for research on CF-related diabetes and disease pathology in the lung pancreasintestine vas deferens and gallbladder.","Affect;Alleles;Animal Experiments;Animal Model;Animals;Antibiotics;Area;Arginine;Biological;Biophotonics;Birth;Blood;Breeding;Bronchoalveolar Lavage;CRISPR/Cas technology;Caring;Cell Therapy;Cells;Client;Clinical;Collaborations;Communities;Comparative Pathology;Comparative Study;Containment;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Databases;Delta F508 mutation;Development;Disease;Ductal Epithelial Cell;Endocrine;Ensure;Family suidae;Farming environment;Feces;Ferrets;Fibrocystic Disease of Pancreas;Foundations;Functional disorder;Funding;Gallbladder;Gene Transfer;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Genotype;Glucose Clamp;Harvest;Histologic;IACUC;Image;Inbreeding;Internal Ribosome Entry Site;Intestines;Iowa;Islets of Langerhans;Knock-in;Knock-out;Laboratories;Lead;Lung;Mediating;Medicine;Metabolic;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Natural regeneration;OGTT;Organ;Organoids;Pancreas;Pancreatic duct;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pharmacology;Physiological;Population;Preparation;Procedures;Production;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary function tests;Quality Control;Recording of previous events;Reporter;Research;Research Personnel;Research Support;Resources;Sampling;Services;Ships;Specimen;Spectrometry Mass Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization;System;Techniques;Testing;Tissue Harvesting;Tissue Sample;Tissue Viability;Tissues;Training;Transgenic Organisms;Translational Research;Universities;Urine;VX-770;Vas deferens structure;Viral Vector;Weight Gain;biobank;blood glucose regulation;cell type;cellular targeting;college;congenic;cost;cost effective;cost effectiveness;cystic fibrosis mouse;cystic fibrosis related diabetes;drug testing;gene therapy;investigator training;islet;member;new technology;offspring;porcine model;progenitor;programs;recombinant virus;sample collection;shared database;somatic cell nuclear transfer;stem cell therapy;stem cells;synergism;vector","Animal Models Core-Core 3","n/a","NIDDK","10225750","6/22/2021","RFA-DK-19-003","5P30DK054759-22","5","P30","DK","054759","22","","","9/30/1998","3/31/2025","ZDK1-GRB-M","8177","1876393","ENGELHARDT, JOHN F","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","275523"," ","178332","97191"," "," ",

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases","Abstract/Summary (Administrative Core; Core 1)The Administrative Core provides oversight of the Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) under thesupervision of the Center Executive Committee and External Advisors. One major area of responsibility islargely administrative including financial documentation and accountability for the Center's Pilot and FeasibilityProgram and its Cores and oversight of external review of the Center overall. Three major governing bodiescontribute to the review of various Center functions. The Pilot and Feasibility Committee oversees decisionsregarding pilot funding with each pilot receiving two external reviews before a decision is made. The ExecutiveCommittee is the major decision-making body of the Center and makes final judgments about the funding ofnew pilots and the renewal of ongoing pilots for a second year of funding. The External Advisory Committeeprovides direction to the Executive Committee as does the College of Medicine leadership. A second majorresponsibility of this Core is to enrich CF-related scientific programs and it does so through sustainedmembership and pilot recruitment efforts scientific enrichment programs (seminar series retreats workshopsand less formal scientific working-group meetings) and assessment of the Center's Research Cores and theirservices (e.g. through investigator questionnaires and external review). Lastly the Administrative Core acts asa conduit for research and services to both investigators outside the University of Iowa and the lay community(e.g. by maintaining the Center web site). In summary the Administrative Core assists its members in makingbreakthroughs in CF research and molecular therapies by: 1) recruiting talented junior investigators intocareers in CF research and mentoring them through its pilot program and Center activities; 2) assisting theResearch Cores in providing efficient high quality and cost-effective services; and 3) providing forums for theexchange of new information and ideas among its members through its Enrichment Programs.","Accountability;Achievement;Administrator;Advisory Committees;Area;Budgets;Communities;Cystic Fibrosis;Decision Making;Documentation;Educational workshop;Ensure;Evaluation;Funding;Goals;Group Meetings;Iowa;Journals;Judgment;Leadership;Maintenance;Medicine;Mentors;Molecular;Monitor;Policies;Postdoctoral Fellow;Publications;Questionnaires;Records;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Series;Services;Summary Reports;Supervision;Talents;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Visit;career;college;cost effective;gene therapy;graduate student;member;programs;ranpirnase;recruit;web site;working group","Administrative Core","n/a","NIDDK","10225748","6/22/2021","RFA-DK-19-003","5P30DK054759-22","5","P30","DK","054759","22","","","9/30/1998","3/31/2025","ZDK1-GRB-M","8175","1876393","ENGELHARDT, JOHN F","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","104659"," ","67740","36919"," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","Overall Project Summary/Abstract (Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis)For the past 21 years this P30 Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis has focused on developing effectivetreatments for cystic fibrosis (CF) through an increased understanding of disease pathogenesis theidentification of relevant cellular targets for gene manipulation and the development of technologies capable ofeffectively delivering or editing the CFTR gene in vivo. The creation of multiple types of CF pig and ferretmodels had led to an expansion of CF research over the past 5-year funding period. While during previousfunding cycles CF lung research has been one focus area and within the scope of these P30 CF Centers wehave also greatly expanded research in other areas directly within the NIDDK mission. These areas ofresearch will be further expanded in this application through the Center's Research Cores and the focus offaculty research areas. These areas include research on CF pancreatic disease and its similarities anddifferences to other forms of juvenile pancreatitis cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) research CFgallbladder disease and CF intestinal disease. Many of these areas were already strengths during theprevious funding period. Furthermore the creation of the tools required to interrogate CF disease processes inorgans like the pancreas have been enabled by new genetic engineering approaches in ferrets through theCenter's Animal Models Core. The Center has productively fostered CF research through the followingmechanisms. 1) The Center's Pilot and Feasibility Program which has sponsored 66 pilots over the previous21 years of funding has brought numerous new Members and expertise into the Center and has fostered thematuration of talented junior Associate Members to independent tenure-track faculty. 2) The establishment orexpansion of several core facilities (Vector Core Cell and Tissue Core Comparative Pathology Core AnimalModels Core and Clinical Core) devoted to CF research has provided Center investigators with specializedvectors CF model systems (human pig ferret and mouse) and approaches that are testing importanthypotheses about CF pathogenesis and developing effective therapies. These resources have also enabledthe Center to serve as a resource for the distribution of viral vectors and CF pig and ferret resources tonumerous outside institutions. 3) Expansion of the number of CF ferret and pig models that develop lungpancreatic gallbladder and intestinal abnormalities like those observed in CF patients has greatly facilitatedresearch by Center Members. 4) The Center's Enrichment Programs have fostered interdisciplinaryinteractions and training. 5) Establishment of formal internal and external mechanisms for review of the Centerthe Cores and the Pilot and Feasibility projects has ensured a high level of excellence and the mostappropriate utilization of the Center's resources.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTUnderstanding the basic molecular details behind disease is a critical challenge for science. This proposalaims to approach this by focusing on an understudied aspect of disease: the roles of RNA structure. Theoverall goal of this project is to optimize a methodological pipeline to discover functional RNA elements in thegenomes of humans and their pathogens deduce their structures and characterize their functions. The endobjective is to gain a better understanding of how RNA structure is implicated in disease and to use thisinformation in novel ways to contribute toward improving human health: for example by advancing RNA-basedtherapeutic treatments. Over the course of this project we will optimize this pipeline by focusing on the infectionof human B cells by EpsteinBarr virus (EBV). EBV is a widespread human pathogen which infects over 95%of the adult population and is implicated in a variety of cancers and autoimmune diseases. The mechanismsbehind EBV pathogenicity remain elusive and this proposal aims to focus on the roles of RNA and RNAstructure in infection and disease. Over the course of establishing lifelong latent infection EBV both generatesits own RNAs and dysregulates various human RNAs. RNA plays a central role in human and pathogenbiology forming the protein-coding and non-protein-coding molecules that are essential to gene expression.RNA structure plays important regulatory roles: e.g. by mediating interactions or altering accessibility offunctional motifs. Thus knowing the structure of RNA provides a great deal of biological knowledge and can beused to deduce functional sequences from the genome. My previous work combined computational andexperimental approaches to discover RNA structures encoded within the EBV genome. This included a novelclass of viral RNAs the stable intronic sequence (sis)RNAs which I discovered. In this current proposal wefollow up on the functional analyses of EBV-encoded RNAs and expand our focus to include human RNAs.This will be accomplished by revisiting both genomes using innovative new approaches that we developed andnovel methods that are currently under development. This will be combined with genome-wide biochemicalstructure analyses and functional assays performed in vitro (in cell-free systems) and within cultured human Bcells. The results of this proposal will be an enhanced basic understanding of how RNA and RNA structure isinvolved in EBV infection and disease. There will be wider implications beyond EBV and its associatedpathologies: for example part of our pipeline involves the analysis of conservation of RNA structure betweenpathogens (potentially finding conserved mechanisms). As well many discovered human motifs affected byEBV will likely have functional roles in cancer and immunity; therefore this proposal will provide generalinsights into disease. These functional structures provide attractive targets for emerging RNA-targetingtherapies; thus there is great potential for this proposal to advance human health: e.g. in new treatments forcancer and autoimmune disease.","Adult;Affect;Algorithms;Archives;Autoimmune Diseases;B-Lymphocytes;Basic Science;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Cell Line;Cell-Free System;Cells;Cellular Assay;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Code;Data;Databases;Development;Disease;Drug Targeting;Elements;Epstein-Barr Virus Infections;Event;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Goals;Health;Herpesviridae;Human;Human Genome;Human Herpesvirus 4;Immunity;In Vitro;Infection;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Mediating;Methodology;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Structure;Mosses;Mutation;Names;Oncogenes;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Play;Population;Process;Proteins;RNA;RNA Databases;RNA Sequences;Research;Role;Science;Scientist;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Untranslated RNA;Viral;Viral Genome;Virus;Virus Diseases;Work;base;cancer therapy;follow-up;genome-wide;human pathogen;improved;in silico;innovation;insight;latent infection;novel;novel strategies;pathogen;pathogen genome;pathogenic virus;repository;targeted treatment;tool;transcriptome;tumorigenesis;viral RNA;virus host interaction","Finding folding and characterizing the functions of disease-relevant RNA structures","PROJECT NARRATIVETo gain a better understanding of disease this project aims to combine computational and experimentalapproaches to map out RNA molecular structures that are important to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): a virus thatcauses lifelong infections in ~95% of adults and is associated with cancer and autoimmune disease.

"Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Health Disparities; Human Genome; Minority Health; Pediatric; Prevention","AbstractNonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are the most common craniofacial birth defects in humans affectingapproximately 1 in 700 individuals worldwide. Genome-wide linkage and association studies have identifiedseveral risk alleles for OFCs; however they account for a minority of their estimated heritability. Thereforewhile the ongoing genetic and expression studies may lead to important advances in understanding thebiological basis underlying OFCs a fuller picture will only emerge as the interaction of susceptibility variantswith other factors such as epigenetic changes are established. Epigenetic modification is a likely mechanismthrough which environmental factors and genetic variation may alter gene expression. DNAm is a covalentaddition of a methyl (CH3) group to the nucleotide cytosine which can lead to changes in transcriptionalactivity of the targeted gene. We hypothesize that changes in methylation and the resulting differential geneexpression is an epigenetic risk factor for OFCs and that DNAm mediates genetic influences in OFCs risk. Ourmain goals are to characterize genome-wide DNAm variation that can impact the risk for OFCs; and explorethe genetic-epigenetic interactions (meQTLs) involved in the etiology of OFC. To do so this project proposes apowerful strategy using the largest sample set (to date) of monozygotic twins and sibling pairs discordant fornonsyndromic OFCs used to study epigenetic risk factors. This is a key step and an innovative approach thatwill allow uncovering epigenetics risk factors that are invisible to conventional GWAS and DNA sequencingmethods. The central hypothesis of this proposal will be tested with the following specific aims: (1) Todetermine genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in MZ twins discordant for OFCs; (2) To explore thegenetic-epigenetic interactions (meQTLs) involved in the etiology of OFCs. Within aim 2 we will attemptto replicate the genetic-epigenetic interactions identified in the preliminary analysis (obtained since the firstsubmission of this proposal) and top hits resulting from Aim 1 using an independent cohort of cleft discordantsibling pairs. The outstanding team of mentors (Dr. Jeff Murray Dr. Robert Philibert Dr. Mary Marazita andDr. Moreno-Uribe) consultants (Dr. Xie and Dr. Drake) collaborator (Dr. Lie) and advisors (Dr. Amendt Dr.Wehby and Dr. Butali) assembled in this proposal covers all areas of the much needed additional trainingnecessary to accomplish the proposed research and training aims. They will provide guidance and facilitate thegrowth of the PI during the transition to independence. Although very well trained initially the five years hiatusin the PI's career justify the need for additional training in the rapidly moving fields of epigenetics and big dataapplications. The proposed training and research aims are tailored to build upon the PI's previous experienceand to provide the additional training in epigenetics and analytical methods necessary to propel the PI'sdevelopment as an independent researcher able to integrate epigenetic and genetic data to study complexcraniofacial birth defects.","Aberrant DNA Methylation;Affect;Area;Behavioral;Big Data;Biological;Caring;Cleft Lip;Cleft Palate;Complex;Congenital Abnormality;Cytosine Nucleotides;DNA;DNA Methylation;DNA Sequence;DNA sequencing;Data;Data Set;Dental;Development;Disease;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;Etiology;Foundations;Funding Opportunities;Future;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genetic Variation;Genotype;Goals;Growth;Healthcare Systems;Heritability;Human;Individual;Interdisciplinary Study;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Mediating;Mental disorders;Mentors;Methods;Methylation;Minority;Modification;Monozygotic twins;Nutritional;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Positioning Attribute;Prevention;Quality of life;Quantitative Trait Loci;Research;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resources;Risk;Risk Estimate;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;Siblings;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Site;Societies;Speech;Suicide;Susceptibility Gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissue-Specific Gene Expression;Training;Twin Multiple Birth;Variant;Work;analytical method;base;bead chip;cancer type;career;case control;cleft lip and palate;cohort;cost;craniofacial;craniofacial complex;design;digital;ear infection;epigenetic regulation;experience;feeding;genetic risk factor;genetic variant;genome wide association study;genome wide methylation;genome-wide;genome-wide analysis;genome-wide linkage;innovation;methylation pattern;mortality;novel;orofacial cleft;psychosocial;risk prediction;risk variant","A Twin Approach for Genome-Wide Differential DNA Methylation in Orofacial Clefting","NARRATIVENonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFCs) are the most common craniofacial birth defects.

"Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Patient Safety","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe transition from acute to chronic pain has eluded researchers for years likely due to its complex nature andthe inherent individual variability. The ability to identify individuals at risk and those with reduced risk for thetransition to chronic pain using biomarkers will advance personalized acute pain treatment strategies reducereliance on opioid pharmacotherapy and help identify novel therapeutic targets thereby transforming themanagement of acute pain events. The Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures (A2CPS) Program aims to identifybiomarkers and their collective biosignatures (a combination of several individual biomarkers) that predictsusceptibility or resilience to the development of chronic pain after an acute pain event through thedevelopment of a large consortium. The advantage of multisite observational studies is their ability tocomprehensively phenotype large population cohorts across multiple biopsychosocial domains in a relativelyshort time. This application describes a partnership between a strong group of pain scientists (Sluka FreyLaw) and the Clinical Trials Statistical and Data Management Center (Coffey Ecklund) at the University ofIowa. The proposed CCC applies thorough and well-organized principles to facilitate support and enhance thescientific rigor and effectiveness of key stakeholders for the identification of critical biomarkers for the acute tochronic pain transition using the following task-based specific aims: 1) Lead the development andimplementation of clinical protocols. 2) Provide oversight and management of collaborative activities across theconsortium to support the overall goals of A2CPS. And 3) Facilitate transparent and effective communicationbetween consortium members. The CCC will support study design bringing expertise in pain and adaptivedesigns to help identify biomarkers for study inclusion; promote efficiency and quality through development ofmilestones Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) individualized recruitment plans and staff trainingprotocols. The CCC will be responsible for regulatory procedures including: standardizing the electronic healthrecord; coordinating a central Institutional Review Board (cIRB); and convening a Data Safety and MonitoringBoard (DSMB). The CCC will track protocol quality control procedures and safety monitoring; perform centralmonitoring and on-site monitoring visits; and monitor progress towards A2CPS milestones particularly site-specific enrollment and retention targets a critical component in the success of the A2CPS initiative. Thesuccess of the A2CPS Program is dependent on effective management and coordination of activities acrossthe Consortium. We have assembled a team with expertise spanning pain science clinical trials in patientswith pain and other conditions and successful large multi-site trial coordination.

Compared withthe general population the HR (95% confidence interval) for dementia among ischemic stroke survivors was1.72 (1.661.77) 2.70 (2.532.89) after intracerebral hemorrhage and 2.74 (2.453.06) after aSAH.Why is that?? In aSAH subjects accumulation of hemoglobulin (Hb) and non-heme iron (Fe) which are thenatural byproduct lysis of red blood cells leads to significant neuronal cells death. Several preclinical studies inanimals showed that both products lead to neuronal death and atrophy of any brain structures exposed to itand specifically the hippocampus and amygdala. These data were replicated in human where authors foundthe level of ferritin (Ft) in CSF a reporter of the amount of Fe in brain was found to strongly correlate withprogression to Alzheimer's disease (AD).What is the mechanistic pathway of this process?? Our group showed that Hb is toxic to neuronal cells invitro and adding deferiprone (De) attenuated and reversed this effect significantly. We then confirmed theseresults in a mouse model of intraventricular hemorrhage. Additionally in a proof-of-concept study we showedthat De significantly decreased Ft in CSF (p<0.0001) suggesting a potential therapeutic effect. Furthermoreothers also showed in preclinical studies using different animal models Fe chelating agents decrease Fecontent both in the subarachnoid space and intraventricular improving the functional and cognitive outcome inthese animals. Therefore we propose this grant to test the hypothesis that deferiprone a lipid soluble Fechelating agent and therefore diffuse easily across the blood-brain barrier will significantly decrease Ft (areporter of total non-heme Fe content in CSF) in subjects with aSAH and hence improve cognitive function.To test this hypothesis we propose a phase 1/2a single-center randomized double-blinded placebo vs. De trialthat recruits and enrolls 66 subjects with aSAH who require placement of EVD as a standard of care. Subjectswill be randomized equally into 2 groups: A) placebo & B) 15 mg/kg bid for 21 days. Ft will be collected dailyfrom CSF. We will also test the cognitive changes using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test along with abattery of well-standardized and widely used cognitive tests that measure various aspects of cognitive andbehavioral functioning. We will also assess the volume of hippocampus and amygdala in this cohort andcompare them to a matched historic control cohort using specific MRI protocol. These tests will be correlatedwith the Ft content in CSF and the volume of hippocampus and amygdala on imaging studies obtained.","Address;Age;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Amygdaloid structure;Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages;Animal Model;Animals;Apolipoprotein E;Atrophic;Attenuated;Behavioral;Blood;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Cells;Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage;Chelating Agents;Clinical Research;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Cohort Studies;Confidence Intervals;Control Groups;Cytolysis;Data;Databases;Dementia;Development;Diffuse;Disease Progression;Double-Blind Method;Drainage procedure;Enrollment;Erythrocytes;Exposure to;Family;Ferritin;General Population;Grant;Hippocampus (Brain);Hospitals;Human;Impaired cognition;In Vitro;Intervention;Intraventricular;Ischemic Stroke;Lead;Lipids;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Medical;Memory impairment;Neurologic Deficit;Neurons;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Phase;Placebos;Process;Protocols documentation;Randomized;Reporter;Risk;Standardization;Stroke;Structure;Subarachnoid Hemorrhage;Subarachnoid Space;Survivors;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Therapeutic Effect;Translating;Work;age group;animal data;base;cognitive change;cognitive function;cognitive performance;cognitive testing;cohort;genetic risk factor;hazard;high risk;human model;imaging study;improved;intraventricular hemorrhage;mild cognitive impairment;mortality;mouse model;neuroimaging;neuron loss;population based;post stroke;preclinical study;recruit;risk variant;sex;standard of care;stroke survivor;years of life lost","The Use of Deferiprone to Improve Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Cognitive Outcome: U-DISCO","Project Narrative: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) survivors have long term cognitive deficits and memoryimpairment in their productive years with major responsibilities with respect to work and family.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our research program is to develop the scientific evidence needed to bring competency-based evaluation of surgical skills to orthopedics. The objective of this application is to provide the orthopedic trainingcommunity with scientifically defendable criteria for critical orthopedic surgical skills at three key developmental pointsin surgical residency: ready to operate ready to lead a surgery supervised by faculty and ready for independent practice.The central hypothesis of this project is that orthopedic surgical skill competence can be objectively quantitatively andreliably measured from surgical results that impact patient safety. This hypothesis is based on previous multi-institutionalsimulation studies conducted with residency programs throughout the Midwest region. The proposed research explorestraining and assessment programs with several novel surgical simulators. It will also explore ground-breaking analysistechniques for assessing operating room performance from surgical radiographs and from computational image-based 3Dmodel reconstruction. This project further expands previous work to more residency programs and to two national ortho-pedic organizations: the Orthopedic Trauma Association which offers training programs to over a hundred residents sev-eral times a year and to the American Board of Orthopedic Surgeons which reviews the credentials and skills of 900 or-thopedic surgeons each year certifying many to become official diplomates of ABOS. The participation of these national organizations which provide a large number of potential research participantscreates the opportunity for achieving exciting new research goals including these three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 isto measure orthopedic trauma surgery skill through surgical results. The working hypothesis for this aim is that sur-gical skill in orthopedic trauma can be measured by analyzing radiographic images associated with a surgery. SpecificAim 2 is to develop simulator-based training programs that improve surgical results. The working hypothesis is thatresidents who practice key skills until achieving proficiency will perform better in the operating room than residents with-out training. Specific Aim 3 is to define simulator-based assessments that generalize to clinical performance. Theworking hypothesis is that simulator assessment measurements will discriminate among levels of surgical skill and willalso generalize across surgical tasks and between simulation and clinical practice. The proposed research will provide a safe environment for orthopedic surgeons to acquire valuable experiencewithout putting patients at risk. It will also help to establish reliable measures of clinical performance competency andtheir potential use for credentialing and certification. Finally as new simulation capabilities become available over theensuing years this work will have successfully shown the way from development to changing practice."," ","Simulation to Support Competency-Based Training in Orthopedic Trauma","Project Narrative The proposed research will provide a safe environment for orthopedic trauma surgeons to acquire valuable surgi-cal experience without putting patients at risk.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryExperimental data from such fields as structural biology proteomics and genomics are providing enormousamounts of information about the intracellular world of bacteria. What is currently missing is a combinedstructural model of the bacterial cell that integrates these disparate sources of data in such a way that allowskey biological processes to be simulated as they might occur in vivo. The goal of the proposed projecttherefore is to continue development of computational methods intended in the long-term to allow structuralmodels of entire bacterial cells to be constructed and simulated. The laboratory has previously reported astructural model of the cytoplasm of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Current and future workwill seek to extend that work and focus on developing high-resolution models of the chromosome of E. coliand its nucleoid-associated proteins: current chromosome models are at levels of resolution too coarse toallow molecular-level interpretations of behavior. The resulting models will be used to explicitly simulateproteins searching for their genomic binding sites and to model aspects of short-time chromosomal dynamicsthat have recently become amenable to experimental study. In both cases it is anticipated that the ability todirectly interpret the observed behavior in terms of the underlying chromosomal structure will provideimportant mechanistic insights unattainable by any other method. In addition to chromosomal work effortswill continue to construct quantitatively-predictive models of the effects of crowded intracellular conditionson protein folding behavior. Accompanying these application-oriented studies will be method-developmentwork focused on developing simple but realistic descriptions of interactions between all types of biomoleculethat are found in the cell and on implementing methods to rapidly compute these and other interactions (e.g.hydrodynamics) on the cellular scale. Progress in each of these general project areas will be assessed bymaking repeated quantitative comparisons with experimental data that are already available in the literaturefor the exact same biomolecular systems. As well as potentially providing quantitative insights into a numberof aspects of protein and chromosomal behavior in vivo the proposed work will deliver to the communitycomputer simulation code and accompanying potential functions suitable for modeling a wide range ofbiomolecular systems. The simulation code the high-resolution models of the chromosome and all other dataaccrued during pursuit of the proposed work will be made freely available in downloadable form.The proposed work is relevant to public health because its long-term goal is the construction of a completestructural model of an important bacterial pathogen  Escherichia coli  and because it seeks to understandthrough the use of molecular simulations how the biological processes that underpin life operate in vivo. Theformer aspect of the work may lead to the identification of new therapeutic strategies for dealing withbacterial pathogens; the latter may illuminate intracellular disease states in higher organisms such as humans.","Area;Bacteria;Bacterial Model;Behavior;Binding Sites;Biological Process;Cell model;Cells;Chromosome Structures;Chromosomes;Chromosomes Human 16-18;Code;Communities;Computer Simulation;Computing Methodologies;Crowding;Cytoplasm;Data;Development;Disease;Escherichia coli;Future;Genomics;Goals;Gram-Negative Bacteria;Human;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Literature;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Organism;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;Reporting;Resolution;Route;Source;Structural Models;System;Time;Work;combat;experimental study;in vivo;insight;method development;novel therapeutic intervention;pathogenic bacteria;predictive modeling;protein folding;simulation;structural biology","Molecular Simulations of the Cell","Project NarrativeDeveloping a molecular-level view of intracellular behavior represents an important steptoward understanding how dysregulation of biological processes can lead to disease.

As a result there is a critical need to utilize new surveymethodologies that has similar speed costs and representativeness as sentinel physician networks butovercomes its weaknesses. Without this knowledge we will continue to collect information on immunization-related issues using a method that is potentially biased and lacks the speed and flexibility that CDC needs.The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish a new methodology for collecting data on immunizationissues that provides this information more quickly affordably flexibly and arguably more representative thansentinel physician networks. The overall objective of this application is to recruit health care workers andmembers of the general public via opt-in online survey panels and use computer-assisted self-interviewing(CASI) instruments to meet the information needs of CDC and other groups who make vaccinerecommendations policies and programs. To that end our objectives for this proposal are listed below.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health; Women's Health","Project Summary/AbstractKenya has one of the world's largest HIV and AIDS epidemics with about 1.6 million people living with HIV and25000 people dying from AIDS in 2018. Adolescents especially girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV. Inwestern Kenya over 50% of adolescents had sexual intercourse before the age of 18; however youth betweenthe ages of 15-19 have low rates of condom use and HIV testing. Stigma negatively affects HIV preventionbehaviors including condom use and HIV testing. In Kenya complex interactions between social capitalreligiosity and biological sex shape societies' discriminating attitudes towards youth perceived to be infectedwith HIV (i.e. social stigma) which in turn affects HIV prevention. The University of Iowa is partnering withTangaza University College (Nairobi) and Gynocare Women's and Fistula Hospital (Eldoret) to elucidate thecomplex relationship between social capital religiosity sex and HIV-related stigma among adolescents (ages15-19) and its impact on HIV prevention in western Kenya.Focusing on three counties in western Kenya this two-year mixed-methods project will develop contextualizedmeasures of social capital religiosity and HIV-related stigma (Aim 1); determine the relationship betweensocial capital religiosity sex HIV-related stigma and HIV-preventive behaviors using quantitative methods(Aim 2); and explicate the relationships between social capital religiosity sex and HIV-related stigma usingqualitative methods (Aim 3). For Aim 1 cognitive interviewing techniques will be used with a purposive sampleof 12 girls and 12 boys to contextualize and validate a 13-item social capital instrument a 10-item religiosityscale and a 27-item instrument to assess social stigma related to HIV. The psychometric properties of thesecontextualized measures will be assessed through a pilot survey administered to a sample of 100 adolescents.For Aim 2 a survey that includes the validated measures developed in Aim 1 will be administered to 765randomly selected unmarried girls and boys (ages 15-19) from in western Kenya. Multiple regression analysiswill be used to examine the association between (1) social capital and HIV-preventive behaviors (i.e. condomuse and HIV testing) and the potential mediating role of social stigma; and (2) social capital and social stigmaand the potential moderating role of religiosity and sex. For Aim 3 36 in-depth interviews will be conductedwith adolescents (ages 15-19) parents religious leaders teachers and health care providers to betterunderstand the complex relationships identified in Aim 2.Led by an experienced Executive Committee and Advisory Board this study will develop three new scales andidentify potential pathways to reduce HIV-related stigma and increase HIV-preventive behaviors amongadolescents in western Kenya. This project will also increase the research capacity of two Kenyan institutionsto examine HIV-related stigma and its consequences. Ultimately this partnership will allow us to designeffective interventions to address stigma and promote young people's health throughout Kenya.","AIDS prevention;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Address;Adolescent;Affect;Africa South of the Sahara;Age;Assessment tool;Attitude;Behavior;Belief;Cause of Death;Coitus;Complex;County;Diagnosis;Disclosure;Discrimination;Disease;Epidemic;Face;Fistula;Frequencies;Gender;Goals;HIV;Health;Health Personnel;High Prevalence;Hospitals;Human immunodeficiency virus test;Individual;Institution;Intervention;Interview;Iowa;Kenya;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Parents;Pathway interactions;Perception;Persons;Population;Prevention strategy;Preventive;Property;Psychometrics;Qualitative Methods;Regression Analysis;Religion and Spirituality;Religious Belief;Reporting;Research;Resources;Role;Sampling;Schools;Shapes;Social Network;Social support;Societies;Sports;Surveys;Techniques;Universities;Unmarried;Unsafe Sex;Woman;Youth;base;biological sex;boys;care seeking;cognitive interview;college;condom use rate;condoms;design;effective intervention;experience;girls;instrument;men;negative affect;sex;sexual encounter;social capital;social culture;social relationships;social stigma;teacher","Building Capacity to Reduce HIV-Related Stigma among Adolescents in Western Kenya","Project NarrativeAdolescents especially girls are vulnerable to HIV in Kenya where stigma and discrimination present animportant challenge to HIV prevention.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Substance Misuse","Relapse to heroin use remains a significant challenge in the treatment of heroin addiction yet ourunderstanding of those neural systems that enable individuals to inhibit heroin seeking and relapse remainspoor. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the neural circuits and the changes in those circuits thatunderlie the inhibition of heroin-seeking behavior using rat models of heroin seeking. Previous work withcocaine seeking has suggested that the infralimbic cortex is involved in the extinction and inhibition of cocaineseeking. Yet the role of this prefrontal region in opioid seeking has been unclear as studies have producedfindings indicating that the infralimbic promotes and inhibits opioid seeking. As increasing evidence suggeststhat different projections from prefrontal regions can mediate distinct functions we have hypothesized that theability of the infralimbic to either promote or inhibit heroin seeking is related to the specific projections from thisregion to the nucleus accumbens shell (NAshell) vs. the amygdala. In addition we have recently developedpreliminary data suggesting that the anterior portion of the insular cortex (rostral agranular insular cortexRAIC) inhibits heroin seeking. However other studies with other drugs of abuse indicate that the RAIC alsoappears to promote drug-seeking behavior. Thus it seems likely that as with the IL the key to understandingthe role of the RAIC in heroin seeking depends on targeting different projections. Indeed like the infralimbicthe RAIC projects to the amygdala a region that prior studies have found to be involved in promotingreinstatement to heroin seeking. However the RAIC also provides an input to the infralimbic itself thusproviding a mechanism for how the RAIC may influence and interact with the infralimbic during the extinctionand inhibition of heroin seeking. The proposed studies therefore will examine these circuits during heroinseeking and will include approaches that have not to our knowledge been used in studies of heroin seeking.In particular our studies will examine the neurophysiological correlates of heroin seeking in the RAIC and ILvia ensemble recordings in both regions simultaneously. The findings from this work will likely reveal neuronalsubpopulations in both regions related to the extinction and/or inhibition of heroin seeking. Moreover ourproposed work will use optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations of the specific projections from theinfralimbic to the NAshell and amygdala and from the RAIC to the infralimbic cortex and amygdala. Specificallythese manipulations will allow us to interrogate the role of each pathway in the encoding of the extinctionlearning and the reinstatement of heroin seeking. As a result this proposal will provide converging lines ofevidence regarding this circuitry and the inhibition of heroin seeking. The findings from the studies will furnishcritical new basic knowledge of the neural systems underlying the suppression of heroin seeking that willpotentially lead to the development of more effective treatments that strengthen such systems in heroin-addicted individuals.","Address;Amygdaloid structure;Anterior;Behavior;Behavior Control;Behavioral Paradigm;Brain region;Cocaine;Complex;Conflict (Psychology);Consumption;Custom;Data;Development;Electrophysiology (science);Epidemic;Extinction (Psychology);Face;Foundations;Future;Goals;Heroin;Heroin Dependence;Heterogeneity;Impairment;Implant;Individual;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Mediating;Modeling;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Output;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Prefrontal Cortex;Rattus;Relapse;Research;Rodent;Rodent Model;Role;Self Administration;Site;Structure;System;Testing;Training;United States;Veins;Work;base;design;drug of abuse;drug seeking behavior;effective therapy;experimental study;heroin use;learning extinction;multi-electrode arrays;neural circuit;neurophysiology;optogenetics;programs;public health relevance;relating to nervous system","Neural systems controlling the inhibition of heroin seeking","Public health relevance: Opioid addiction has grown into a major epidemic in the United Statesas individuals addicted to opioids including heroin face great difficulty in suppressing their driveto consume the drug even long after their previous use of their drug.

Unfortunately vaccine messaging strategies that healthorganizations currently utilize to increase vaccine uptake have been ineffective and in some cases haveworsened vaccine attitudes. Motivations to satisfy psychological needs such as managing threats reducinguncertainty and achieve social goals may bias how people process vaccine-related information and vaccineoutcomes. Motivational fit an alignment with a motive that undermines adult vaccine uptake may be a moreeffective mechanism of behavior change to target with vaccine interventions than current approaches.Specific Aims: 1) Identify which motives have the strongest associations with vaccine outcomes for adultsaged 50; 2) Collaborate with vaccine-hesitant adults aged 50 to create influenza vaccine messages thathave motivational fit; 3) Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a vaccine messaging efficacy study.Research Plan: To accomplish these aims Dr. Scherer will use a national demographically-diverse onlinesample of adults aged 50 to identify four motives that are most strongly associated with vaccine uptake (i.e.largest effect sizes) for adults aged 50 and test whether scales measuring these motives need to be vaccine-specific. He will then collaborate with vaccine-hesitant adults aged 50 to develop and test influenza vaccinemessages targeting each of the four motives. Finally he will conduct a pilot study with a clinical population toevaluate the feasibility of conducting planned efficacy studies of the motivational fit vaccine messages.Career Development Plan: Dr. Scherer will develop 1) foundational content knowledge in the aging processto engage in aging research and expertise in 2) psychometrics; 3) patient-centered design; and 4) healthservices research with adults aged 50. Dr. Scherers training goals will be supported by close mentorshipfrom an interdisciplinary team; advanced didactic coursework; and other career development opportunities.Environment: The University of Iowa offers an ideal environment for Dr. Scherer to pursue his training; withmentorship from well-established experts additional guidance from an advisory committee and a departmentdedicated to his long-term success in becoming an independent investigator in healthy aging research.","Accounting;Adult;Advisory Committees;Advocacy;Affect;Age;Aging;Attitude;Award;Baseline Surveys;Behavior;Behavioral Mechanisms;Cessation of life;Chronic;Clinical;Coupled;Data;Development;Development Plans;Doctor of Philosophy;Elderly;Environment;Evaluation;Focus Groups;Foundations;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Health Services Research;Health behavior change;Health system;Healthy People 2020;Individual;Influenza;Influenza vaccination;Interdisciplinary Study;Intervention;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Measures;Mentorship;Methods;Modeling;Motivation;Patients;Pilot Projects;Population;Preventive Health Services;Preventive healthcare;Process;Psychologist;Psychometrics;Pulmonary Heart Disease;Randomized;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Risk;Sampling;Science;Secure;Site;Surveys;Testing;Text;Training;Uncertainty;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Vaccination;Vaccines;Work;age related;aged;base;behavior change;career;career development;cognitive interview;cost;design;economic cost;efficacy study;experimental study;health organization;healthy aging;immune function;improved;influenza infection;influenza virus vaccine;information processing;innovation;insight;lens;middle age;novel;patient oriented;psychologic;skills;social;social cognition;success;uptake;vaccination outcome;vaccine acceptance;vaccine efficacy;vaccine hesitancy;vaccine safety","Creating Innovative Vaccine Messaging by Engaging in Patient-Centered Design with Non-Vaccinating Older Adults","PROJECT NARRATIVEAdults aged 50 account for 95% of the 50000 influenza-associated deaths annually yet vaccine uptakeremains suboptimal.

"Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Neurosciences; Patient Safety; Women's Health","The long-term objective of the Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) initiative is to rapidly and efficiently translate advances in neuroscience into treatments for adults and children with neurological disorders through partnerships with government academia private foundations and industry. Recent discoveries in basic neuroscience have directly led to major breakthroughs in the understanding of disease processes in neurological disorders many which impose an enormous burden on individuals families and communities. Yet there are several organizational and logistical challenges to testing these new therapies in multicenter clinical trials including inefficiencies in regulatory and institutional approvals barriers to recruitment and retention of study participants and a dearth of individuals trained and prepared to be the leaders of multicenter clinical research trials  A central goal of NeuroNEXT is to facilitate from initial conception through final analysis high-quality early phase clinical trials and biomarker studies with clear go/no-go decisions by providing efficient methodological organizational statistical and logistical support. NeuroNEXT is comprised of 25 clinical sites a Clinical Coordinating Center and a Data Coordinating Center. NeuroNEXT innovations include establishing a trial network that requires the use of a central institutional review board a master contract process for all network- funded studies centralized safety review of all studies by a single Data Safety Monitoring Board broad sharing of Standard Operating Procedures and knowledge state-of-the-art early development trial design approaches and the use of the NINDS common data elements for data collection. Applicants who seek to use the network can be novice or experienced trialists thereby greatly expanding the pool of experienced clinical investigators trained and prepared to lead multicenter trials. Nine studies involving partnerships with industry foundations academia and the government were funded in the first six years of the network.  Specific Aim 1 is to work closely with the Data Coordinating Center to continue to support an open collaborative network community that efficiently conducts high-quality clinical trials for neurological disorders.  Specific Aim 2 is to greatly expand the pool of experienced clinical Investigators and research staff who are prepared to be leaders of multicenter clinical research trials by providing education training resources and professional mentorship.  Specific Aim 3 is to continue to provide high-quality statistical data management and protocol coordination support for all network clinical trials.","Academia;Adult;Applications Grants;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Clinical Trials Network;Collaborations;Common Data Element;Communication;Communities;Community Networks;Conceptions;Contracts;Data;Data Collection;Data Coordinating Center;Development;Disease;Distributed Databases;Education;Ensure;Family;Foundations;Funding;Future;Goals;Government;Grant;Individual;Industry;Institutional Review Boards;Knowledge;Lead;Leadership;Logistics;Mentorship;Methodology;Monitor;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Multicenter Trials;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Neurologic;Neurologist;Neurosciences;Online Systems;Participant;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Population;Positioning Attribute;Principal Investigator;Privatization;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Publications;Randomized;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Safety;Schedule;Site;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Standardization;System;Testing;Time;Training;Training Programs;Training and Education;Translating;Translations;United States National Institutes of Health;Well in self;Work;clinical biomarkers;clinical research site;data management;early phase clinical trial;early phase trial;experience;improved;innovation;investigator training;nervous system disorder;novel therapeutics;participant retention;performance site;recruit;stroke clinical trials;success;trial design","Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) - DCC","Despite advances in understanding the causes of several neurological disorders many remain without treatment options.

"Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Human Genome; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","Project SummaryTissue specific regeneration requires the function of progenitor cells that can differentiate to repair diseased orinjured tissues. Affected tissues can contain stem cells and their growth and patterning are controlled bytranscription factors and signaling pathways. Stem cells derived from stem cell niches contribute to theregeneration of mature tissue types in many different organs including the trachea lungs and teeth amongstothers. These niches are formed in developing embryos and must be maintained throughout life by symmetriccellular divisions that produce daughter pluripotent stem cells. Another equally important behavior of the cellsin a stem cell niche is the production of differentiated daughter cells by asymmetric cell division which thentake the place of damaged cells in regenerative organs in order to allow the organ to continue to function.However the roles of specific microRNAs (miRs) in these processes are unclear. miRs have becomeappreciated as playing a role in stem cell differentiation. The ability to coopt miR expression in order toreprogram and control the differentiation of naive cells into different cell types will be an important tool requiredto create artificial organs and repair diseased tissues saving millions of lives and public dollars.We hypothesize that miR-26b is acting in part to regulate the stem cell niche of the lower and upper incisor byregulating Lef-1 expression and that this mechanism may be common to many tissues that house stem cellniches. Thus the absence of miR-26b expression prior to E14.5 allows Lef-1 expression in the oralepithelium (placode) and LaCL (stem cell niche) during development. However after E14.5 miR-26bexpression in the dental epithelium restricts Lef-1 expression and then other factors (Sox2) regulate stem cellmaintenance. In order to determine how Lef-1 and miR-26b is affecting gene expression during developmentand cells we will pursue three aims: 1) to use our murine models to understand in vivo stem cell proliferationand differentiation by Lef-1 and miR-26b OE; and use miR-26b OE to rescue the Lef-1 OE phenotype anddefine the role of miR-26b OE in dental development; 2) validate molecular interactions between miR-26b Lef-1 and known factors involved in DESC proliferation and differentiation; 3) isolate the dental epithelial cells fromWT Lef-1 OE miR-26b OE and rescue mice to identify new genetic pathways using RNA-Seq ChIP-Seq. andSingle cell Seq.","Adult;Affect;Architecture;Artificial Organs;Binding;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biomedical Engineering;Bromodeoxyuridine;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cell Maintenance;Cell Proliferation;Cell division;Cells;Cervical;ChIP-seq;Complex;Daughter;Defect;Dental;Dental Enamel;Development;Disease;Embryo;Embryonic Development;Enhancers;Epigenetic Process;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Glean;Goals;Growth;Human;In Situ Hybridization;Incisor;Injury;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Life;Lung;Mesenchyme;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Mus;Natural regeneration;Odontoblasts;Odontogenesis;Oral;Organ;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phenotype;Play;Pluripotent Stem Cells;Population;Process;Production;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Reporter;Role;Savings;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stains;Stem Cell Factor;Testing;Tissues;Tooth regeneration;Tooth structure;Trachea;Western Blotting;Work;base;cell behavior;cell injury;cell type;craniofacial;daughter cell;epithelial stem cell;experimental study;in vivo;injured;knock-down;morphogens;mouse model;novel therapeutics;oral cavity epithelium;oral tissue;programs;regenerative;repaired;single-cell RNA sequencing;stem;stem cell differentiation;stem cell function;stem cell niche;stem cell proliferation;stem cells;tissue regeneration;tool;transcription factor;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing","Co-opting Lef-1 and miR-26b activities to regulate dental stem cells and their progeny","Narrative This project will determine how stem cell niches within the craniofacial/dental complex are activated byLef-1 and compartmentalized by miR-26b expression.

We have previously reported the synthesis of phenoliclipid natural products and efforts toward two families of polycyclic terpenes as well as a general process forthe synthesis of the cobalt complexes used in the photocatalytic investigations described in Project 2. Thetargets described in this proposal include molecules that will serve as mechanistic probes to studyneurodegeneration and viral diseases as well as leads that may provide new therapeutic opportunities. We areinvestigating methods to target specific structural motifs with established biological activity such as amino-adamantanesand limonoid natural products as well as catalytic methods designed to apply to a broadspectrum of chemical targets. The enabling technology behind these methods is photocatalysis whichharnesses light energy to drive complex catalytic processes. Photocatalysis continues to provide newmechanisms and transformations that are difficult or impossible to access otherwise. Understanding thegoverning principles of these processes allows us to apply that insight to the discovery of new broadly usefulsynthesis methods.Substituted adamantanes appear in a wide variety of molecules with important function includingclinically approved drugs for Alzheimers dementia and viral diseases however efficient synthesis remains achallenge. In Project 1 new amino-adamantane derivatives will be accessed through a new aminoalkylationreaction and new catalytic strategies that enable unique selectivity that is complementary to existingapproaches. The unique strategies described here include a detailed study of the selectivity of new andestablished H-atom transfer methods providing guidelines necessary for selecting the proper HAT catalyst fordifferent substrate classes. In Project 2 a novel polar/radical crossover manifold inspired by the biochemistryof vitamin B12 will be developed for the efficient use of inexpensive and readily available alcohols for bioactivemolecule construction. These methods will be applied to the synthesis of promising natural product targetssuch as the neuroprotective limonoids. The investigation of the neuroprotective activity of limonoids is ofcentral importance therefore alternative pathways will be explored to access to these molecules andderivatives for mechanism of action studies. Overall the concepts described here will provide generalplatforms for the rapid construction of pharmacophores and bioactive natural product derivatives that can beimmediately deployed by biomedical researchers.","Adamantane;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Biochemistry;Biological;Chemicals;Clinical;Cobalt;Complex;Coupling;Development;Exhibits;Family;Goals;Guidelines;Investigation;Light;Lipids;Medicine;Methods;Natural Products;Nerve Degeneration;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenols;Process;Reaction;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Structure;Technology;Terpenes;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Virus Diseases;Vitamin B 12;alcohol availability;bioactive natural products;catalyst;design;human disease;insight;novel;novel therapeutics;pharmacophore;programs;scaffold","New Photocatalytic Coupling Reactions to Prepare Bioactive Molecules","The treatment of human disease from viral infections to neurodegenerative conditions suchas Alzheimer's disease relies in large part on the discovery and development of new medicinesfor therapeutic intervention.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Radiation Oncology","Project Summary/Abstract:There is currently a technological gap in pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton therapy that is resulting in excessspillage of radiation dose outside of the intended target tissue. Existence of this gap represents an importantproblem because until a technological solution is developed patients undergoing PBS proton therapy will beexposed to unwanted radiation dose and the normal tissue complications. The long-term goal is to increasetherapeutic efficacy and reduce the risk of side effects associated with PBS proton therapy. The overallobjective of this project is to translate and validate a new collimator technology called the dynamic collimationsystem (DCS) with an existing commercial PBS proton therapy delivery system in a clinical setting to limit thedose spillage. The DCS makes use of four independently controlled trimmer blades that are designed to movein synchrony with the scanned proton beam during PBS delivery. By intercepting the beam as it arrives at thelateral boundaries of the tumor the dose distribution can be sharpened and dose to surrounding normalstructures can be substantially reduced. Unlike other proposed solutions the DCS can provide uniquecollimation for each energy layer of a PBS proton therapy treatment and a footprint small enough to allowplacement near the surface of the patient. The rationale for the project is that the addition of the DCS toexisting PBS equipment at only a small fraction of the cost of a $30M+ proton therapy center can rapidlytranslate to improved clinical care delivery. Guided by strong preliminary data from our in-silico treatmentplanning studies development of the DCS will be carried out by pursing three specific aims: 1) Design buildand validate a DCS prototype based on our extensive modeling 2) Minimize the treatment time penaltyassociated with the DCS and 3) Provide appropriate methodologies for centers to use the DCS. Under specificaim 1 an existing computer designed model will drive the physical construction of an integrated prototypesystem and the dosimetric performance will be validated against a model of the system. Under specific aim 2a trimmer sequencing algorithm will be developed and tested that allows dynamic motion of trimmer leavessimultaneously with beam scanning. The purpose of this algorithm is to minimize the treatment time penaltyassociated with the DCS with a target treatment time penalty of less than 2 minutes per treatment session.Under specific aim 3 a quality assurance and commissioning approach will be developed to facilitate safe andeffective clinical use of the DCS by the radiation oncology community. The research proposed in thisapplication is innovative because it represents a new and substantial departure from current collimationtechnologies with the introduction of a compact collimator with dynamic motion for shaping individual pencilbeams layer-by-layer. This contribution is expected to be significant as the collimation system will decrease thedose to healthy tissue surrounding the target leading to improved patient outcomes. Ultimately such a devicehas the potential to reduce normal tissue complications for patients undergoing PBS proton therapy.","Air;Algorithms;Area;Benchmarking;Biological Models;Brain;Brain Neoplasms;Cancer Patient;Childhood;Clinical;Collimator;Community Clinical Oncology Program;Data;Development;Devices;Distal;Dose;Ensure;Equipment;Exposure to;Extravasation;Foundations;Goals;Head and Neck Neoplasms;Individual;Industrialization;Institutes;Intercept;Ions;Lateral;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mechanics;Methodology;Mission;Modeling;Motion;National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering;Normal tissue morphology;Outcome;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Performance;Photons;Plant Leaves;Positioning Attribute;Protons;Public Health;Quality of life;Radiation Dose Unit;Radiation Oncology;Radiation Toxicity;Radiation therapy;Research;Risk;Scanning;Shapes;Spottings;Structure;Surface;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Translating;Treatment Efficacy;Validation;Work;base;brain tissue;care delivery;clinical care;commercialization;computer design;cost;cost effective;design;fight against;improved;in silico;innovation;model design;new technology;next generation;proton beam;proton therapy;prototype;quality assurance;side effect;treatment planning;tumor","Sharpening the edge in pencil-beam proton therapy: an aftermarket collimation system to better spare normal tissue during radiation treatment","Project Narrative:The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on the development of a new device toreduce unwanted radiation dose for cancer patients undergoing proton therapy and is expected to decreasenormal tissue complications and improve quality of life.

The program whose research emphasis is on the interface between human hostand microbial (bacterial and viral) pathogens and their epidemiological spread and preventionprovides an intense mentored research experience for MD and PhD postdoctoral trainees ininfectious diseases. This occurs in conjunction with an individualized curriculum of didacticcourses seminars and journal clubs designed to encourage substantive interactions betweenMDs and PhDs. A short- term 3-month research experience for medical students is also offered.Most faculty are drawn from 1 basic science and 2 clinical departments as well as 2interdisciplinary PhD programs. Collaboration among program faculty is high. Research facilitiesare superb. The scientific program centers around three major areas: 1) Host Defenseemphasizing innate immunity; 2) Microbial Pathogenesis; and 3) Epidemiology and HealthcareInfections. Faculty are divided into: 1) full members; and 2) associate members on the basis oftheir extramural research support and their experience both as an independent investigator andresearch mentor. Primary research mentors come from faculty meeting the criteria for fullmembership. An important aspect of the 3-year research experience for MD postdoctoraltrainees with minimal prior research experience is an intensive exposure to a broad spectrum ofgraduate level basic science courses. All postdoctoral trainees establish a Research AdvisoryCommittee. All trainees attend a research conference as well as a seminar/ journal clubdesigned to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas and scientific approaches between clinicalmedicine and basic science. They will interact with outstanding visiting scientists attendscientific meetings learn scientific writing and grant preparation skills and complete a course inresearch and biomedical ethics.

"Cancer; Hematology; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","Project SummaryThe TEC family kinases are expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin and play key rolesin immune cell signaling cascades during development and immune activation. Two TECkinases ITK and BTK are the focus of this application and are both recognized asimportant targets in efforts to treat immune related diseases. For example the active siteBTK inhibitor ibrutinib is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia but new approachesare needed as drug resistance is foiling efforts to slow progression of disease. The currentrenewal application takes a multifaceted approach to this problem. First we arecapitalizing on the mechanistic findings from the previous award period by carrying outseveral orthogonal screens for small molecule discovery. The findings so far suggest wehave successfully identified small molecule reagents that bind to the TEC kinases andmodulate T- and B-cell signaling.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Disparities; Pediatric","Project Summary/AbstractChildren who speak and read in two languages are the norm around the world and in many US communities.However there is a gap in understanding how language and literacy develops in bilingual and biliteratechildren. A fundamental component of language and literacy development is word recognition. Central to bothspoken and written word recognition is competition: given a word (e.g. cap) multiple lexical candidates areactivated (e.g. cap cab cat) and compete for recognition. The nature of lexical competition within and acrosslanguages in children is largely unaddressed. This is a crucial limitation as prominent theories of bilinguallanguage and cognition rest on how these skills develop. This is of clinical significance because formonolingual children the ability to manage competition is highly predictive of language and literacy outcomesand represents significant challenges for children with language disorders (McMurray et al. 2010). Becausethere are health disparities that perpetuate disproportionate educational achievement for many Spanish-English learners in the US it is crucial that our theoretical models extend beyond single-language learners tostudents who hear and read words in more than one language. The proposed research addresses thislimitation in two aims. In Aim 1 we characterize competition for spoken and written words within and acrosslanguages in Spanish-English dual language learners during a developmental period characterized byvariability in word-level reading skills (middle school). We developed a novel variant of an eye-trackingparadigm to measure both spoken and written word recognition. Individuals hear or see a word and click thecorresponding picture from a display of four: the target (e.g. cap) an acoustically and visually similarcompetitor (e.g. cab) and unrelated items (e.g. net and mud). Eye-movements are time-locked to thedynamics of lexical competition. Given that there are more differences in speech sounds than in letters acrosslanguages (e.g. the speech sound /b/ differs in English and Spanish yet the letter b is identical) we predictthat for spoken words competition will be greater within than across languages whereas for written wordscompetition will be similar within and across languages. In Aim 2 we take an individual differences approachand examine how language and reading proficiency influence these competition dynamics. This aim willdetermine the sources of variability that promote proficient bilingual and biliterate children to achieve efficientword recognition. The current research has a broad-based appeal for theories of language processing becauseit will help characterize a core set of computational principles involved in spoken and written word recognition.Further this project informs theories of bilingual language and literacy development  a high priority researcharea for NICHD  and represents a crucial step toward our long-term goal to create a developmental model ofword recognition as it occurs across modalities (spoken and written) and language context.","13 year old;Academic achievement;Acoustics;Address;Adult;Affect;Area;Child;Cognition;Comb animal structure;Communities;Complex;Development;Educational Status;Employee;English Learner;Eye Movements;Felis catus;Goals;Goat;Hearing;Immersion;Individual;Individual Differences;Language;Language Disorders;Learning;Letters;Measures;Mediation;Modality;Modeling;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Nature;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;Population;Process;Reader;Reading;Research;Research Priority;Rest;Role;School-Age Population;Schools;Source;Speech;Speech Sound;Students;System;Theoretical model;Time;United States;Variant;Visual;Word Processing;Work;base;bilingualism;clinically significant;health disparity;junior high school;language processing;lexical;literacy;millisecond;novel;reading ability;skills;theories;visual tracking","Word recognition in dual language learners: The mechanisms underlying listening and reading in two languages","Project NarrativeWorldwide bilingualism and biliteracy are the norm.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Hypertension","Project Summary/AbstractHeart failure due to chronic hypertension continues to significantly impact human health despite long termmanagement with current treatments. This is in part due to the many unknown factors that underlie thedevelopment of hypertensive heart failure. Research in animal models has demonstrated activation ofpathological gene expression in heart failure suggesting a causal relationship. The objective of this proposal isto determine how Cdk19 (and Cdk8) activity and association with Mediator regulates cardiac gene expressionleft ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction during hypertensive pressure overload stress inmice using transaortic banding (TAB) or Ang-II treatment. It is our hypothesis that Cdk19 activity isnecessary for the complete hypertensive HF functional response through Mediator-dependent transcriptionalregulation. The specific Aims designed to test this hypothesis using a combination of genetically modifiedmice and pharmacological inhibitors are: Aim 1. Determine the requirement for Cdk8/19 activity incardiomyocyte hypertrophic and hypertensive responses. It is our working hypothesis that the activity ofCdk8/19 drives hypertensive HF responses. Based on our preliminary data we predict that in vivo inhibition ofendogenous Cdk8/19 activity with CCT251545 and Senexin A will blunt both LVH after TAB and Ang-IItreatment reducing hypertrophic cardiac remodeling. To address the structural role of Cdk8 and Cdk19 wedeveloped Aim 2. Determine the impact of Cdk8/19 on the physiological and biochemical actions ofcardiomyocytes that are necessary for normal cardiac function. Our working hypothesis is that loss of Cdk8/19results in cardiomyocyte dysfunction due to dysregulated enhancer utilization and gene expression. Due to thepotential redundant roles of Cdk8 and Cdk19 we dont anticipate cardiac knockout of either Cdk8 (Cdk8-cKO)or Cdk19 (Cdk19-KO) alone will block left ventricular hypertrophy or transcriptional remodeling. Howeverwe propose the double knockout of Cdk8/19 will be required due to the role of Cdk8/19 in Mediatorlocalization to stress-responsive enhancers in stressed hearts. The outcomes of this proposal will establishpotential therapeutic targets for modifying transcriptional programing in response to hypertension and heartfailure.","Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Address;Adult;Affect;Angiotensins;Animal Model;Attenuated;Biochemical;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Chronic;Clinical Trials;Complex;Coupling;DNA Binding;DNA Polymerase II;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Data;Development;Disease;Enhancers;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Enhancer Element;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Growth;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Hypertrophy;Heart failure;Human;Hypertension;In Vitro;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Left Ventricular Dysfunction;Left Ventricular Hypertrophy;Longitudinal Studies;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Myocardial dysfunction;Outcome;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Regulation;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent Model;Role;Severities;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stress;Structure;Technology;Testing;Transcriptional Regulation;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;base;cell type;cyclin C;design;heart function;human model;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant breast neoplasm;next generation sequencing;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;paralogous gene;pressure;prevent;programs;promoter;recruit;response;therapeutic target;tool;transcription factor","Cdk19-dependent transcriptional mechanisms in cardiac hypertrophy","Project NarrativeThe proposed research addresses the impact of cardiac transcriptional remodeling that occursin both human and rodent models of heart failure.

"Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease","Project SummaryCalcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) can be viewed as the end-stage of prolonged persistent injury in valvetissue. Isolated valve interstitial cells (VICs) CAVS-prone mice and humans with subclinical aortic valvedisease all demonstrate a propensity for propagation of injury in valve tissue even after the initiating cause isrectified. The goals of this proposal are understand mechanisms and to identify therapeutic strategies with thepotential to inhibit or reverse propagation of injury in valve tissue. Early aortic valve disease entails thickeningand stiffening of valve cusps and disruption of laminar shear at the blood-valve interface. The proposal willaddress the hypothesis that tissue responses to altered mechanical forces may propagate a pattern of injury inthe aortic valve. Therefore experiments proposed for Aim 1 will study modulation of signaling by themechano-responsive calcium channel TRPV4 as a means to inhibit propagation of injury. In other diseasestates persistent tissue injury is characterized by sustained actions of mediators of inflammation which maybe amenable to inhibition by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). New preliminary data indicate thattwo SPMs are expressed in aortic valve cells and that their expression is altered by CAVS-relevant conditions.Experiments proposed for Aim 2 will study the impact of modulation of those two SPMs annexin A1 andchemokine-like receptor-1 upon propagation of injury in aortic valve cells. Both Aims will be pursued usingVICs grown on matrix with mechanical properties that can be manipulated to resemble properties of aorticvalves. Both Aims will be pursued using a mouse model that consistently develops CAVS and which reachesa state where amelioration of the initiating cause of CAVS no longer inhibits disease progression. These newareas of research in aortic valve disease hold promise for translation to effective therapies for CAVS.","Address;Annexin A1;Aortic Valve Stenosis;Area;Blood;CMKLR1 gene;Calcium Channel;Cells;Clinical Research;Data;Disease;Disease Progression;Environment;Experimental Models;Family suidae;Goals;Human;In Vitro;Inflammation Mediators;Injury;Interruption;Intervention;Investigation;Mechanics;Mediator of activation protein;Medical;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Pattern;Physiological;Prevalence;Preventive treatment;Process;Property;Research;Research Support;Resolution;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Stenosis;Structure;Surface;Syndrome;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translations;Up-Regulation;Vanilloid;aortic valve;aortic valve disorder;calcification;cell injury;clinical translation;clinically relevant;design;effective therapy;experimental study;hemodynamics;in vivo;in vivo Model;innovation;interstitial cell;mechanical force;mechanical load;mechanical properties;mouse model;novel;pre-clinical research;receptor;response;response to injury;sensor;tissue injury;valve replacement","Propagation and Resolution of Injury in Calcific Aortic Valve Disease","Project NarrativeWe propose to study mechanisms by which injury propagates in the aortic valve even afteramelioration of the initiating cause of injury.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Minority Health; Pediatric; Prevention","ABSTRACTThe overarching goal of this research is to promote children's positive adaptive pathways of socioemotionaldevelopment and to prevent maladaptive pathways. Our work explains why some children embark on positivepaths toward prosocial internalized rule-abiding conduct and robust social competence whereas othersenter maladaptive paths toward callousness disregard for conduct rules and others' feelings antisocialbehavior and impoverished competence. We focus on the parent-child early attachment relationship formedin the first years of life as a source of those divergent pathways and we longitudinally chart its complexindirect yet powerful long-term implications. On the basis of our past and current work correlational andexperimental in low- and high-risk families we propose that although early parent-child attachment may nothave long-term unqualified direct effects it nevertheless serves as a powerful catalyst or moderator of futuredynamics unfolding between the parent and the child. Specifically early attachment insecurity sets the stagefor an adversarial negative cascade. In insecure parent-child dyads the child's difficult temperament easilytriggers the parent's negative coercive power-assertive control which in turn leads to maladaptive childoutcomes. In contrast early security sets the stage for positive cooperative effective socialization anddefuses risks of negative cascades. To elucidate mechanisms explaining those processes we propose thatthe divergent cascades are due to parents' and children's differing internal representations expectations andperceptions of each other (Internal Working Models or IWMs) that characterize insecure and secure dyads.Those IWMs then come to guide parents' and children's behavior and interactions. A new study of 200community mothers fathers and infants intensively assessed at 7-9 15-17 36-38 and 46-48 months willtest this model. Deploying state-of-the-science measures of parents' and children's social representations inAim 1 we examine their emerging negative or positive IWMs of each other as linked to their early insecure orsecure attachment relationships. Those IWMs are then tested as key mechanisms accounting for divergentcascades that unfold in insecure and secure relationships. In Aim 2 we examine the parent's IWM of thechild as moderating the link between child difficulty and parental control and in Aim 3 we examine the child'sIWM of the parent as moderating the link between parental control and child outcomes. Our team includesexperts in socioemotional development infant and adult cognition molecular genetics and methodology andstatistics. In a multi-method multi-level approach we collect observational genetic and reported measuresof parent and child social cognition temperament attachment parental control and children's outcomes.Analyses rely on structural equation modeling to elucidate mechanisms of divergent developmental cascadesunfolding over time. This research will produce a novel long-advocated but yet to be realized synthesis ofattachment temperament internal representation and behavior in pathways to children's adjustment.","Accounting;Address;Adolescence;Adult;Advocate;Anger;Assertiveness;Basic Science;Behavior;Biological;Characteristics;Child;Child Behavior;Child Rearing;Coercion;Cognition;Cognitive;Communities;Competence;Complex;Data;Development;Equation;Experimental Designs;Family;Family Study;Fathers;Feeling;Funding;Future;Genetic;Goals;Growth;Individuality;Infant;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Knowledge;Life;Link;Long-Term Effects;Longitudinal Studies;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Mind;Modeling;Molecular Genetics;Mothers;Motion;Negative Valence;Neighborhoods;Neurons;Outcome;Parent-Child Relations;Parents;Pathway interactions;Perception;Play;Population;Poverty;Prevention;Prevention program;Problem behavior;Process;Psychopathology;Public Health;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research;Risk;Rules of conduct;Science;Secure;Security;Socialization;Societies;Source;Structure;Temperament;Testing;Time;Toddler;Translational Research;Trust;Work;antisocial behavior;base;callous unemotional trait;catalyst;design;developmental psychology;early childhood;evidence base;expectation;experience;health goals;heuristics;high risk;high risk behavior;infancy;information processing;innovation;intervention program;novel;parental role;prevent;programs;social;social cognition;social skills;statistics;synergism;trait;welfare","Elucidating the legacy of early parent-child attachment:  A new developmental synthesis of temperament internal representation and behavior","NARRATIVEThis longitudinal research elucidates why some children embark on positive paths toward competentprosocial rule-abiding productive lives and robust socioemotional growth whereas others enter paths towardpoor competence disregard for conduct rules and others' welfare callous disruptive and high-risk behaviorsand impoverished socioemotional growth.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Substance Misuse","Relapse to cocaine use remains a significant challenge in the treatment of cocaine addiction yet ourunderstanding of those neural systems that enable individuals to inhibit cocaine seeking and relapse remainspoor. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the neural circuits and the changes in those circuits thatunderlie the inhibition of cocaine-seeking behavior using rat models of cocaine seeking. The current proposalbuilds upon the findings we have obtained in recent years as well as new approaches we have developed inour laboratory. In our studies rats undergo cocaine self-administration extinction training and reinstatementtesting of their cocaine seeking. We have found that the infralimbic cortex is a central component of thesystems involved in the extinction and inhibition of cocaine-seeking behavior. Activity in the infralimbic cortex isnecessary for the normal encoding of the extinction learning as well as extinction expression. For exampleinfralimbic activation inhibits cocaine seeking following extinction training. However the larger circuit in whichthe infralimbic cortex performs these functions remains unclear. In particular as evidence suggests functionalheterogeneity within the infralimbic cortex in terms of its role in cocaine seeking understanding the largercircuitry may provide insight into these issues. The proposed work will focus on the specific pathwaysprojecting into and out of the infralimbic that account for its role in extinction and inhibition of cocaine seeking.The work will include approaches that have not to our knowledge been used in studies of cocaine seekingand therefore will enable notable progress in our knowledge of these systems. In particular our studies willuse multi-site recordings of neural activity during cocaine seeking to understand how a network of brainregions coordinates behavior. Moreover the proposed studies will use optogenetic approaches to examinehow different pathways mediate different aspects of the extinction and inhibition of cocaine seeking. Thefindings from this work will reveal those specific pathways and network activity related to the IL with regard tothe extinction/inhibition of cocaine seeking. Furthermore the proposed work will both 1) examine changes inIL-based circuits as a consequence of cocaine self-administration and extinction and 2) manipulate thesecircuits to determine how they functionally control the inhibition of cocaine seeking. The findings from thestudies will furnish critical new basic knowledge of the neural systems underlying the suppression of cocaineseeking that will potentially lead to the development of more effective treatments that strengthen such systemsin cocaine-addicted individuals.","Amygdaloid structure;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain region;Cell Nucleus;Cocaine;Cocaine Dependence;Consumption;Custom;Data;Development;Drug usage;Elements;Etiology;Extinction (Psychology);Face;Failure;Frequencies;Future;Goals;Heterogeneity;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Impairment;Implant;Individual;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Medial;Mediating;Modeling;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Neurosciences;Nucleus Accumbens;Output;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Rattus;Relapse;Research;Rodent;Role;Site;Structure;Structure of paraventricular nucleus of thalamus;System;Testing;Thalamic structure;Training;Work;base;cocaine self-administration;cocaine use;craving;design;effective therapy;experimental study;insight;learning extinction;multi-electrode arrays;neural circuit;novel strategies;optogenetics;public health relevance;relating to nervous system","Neural systems mediating the extinction and inhibition of cocaine seeking","Public health relevance: Individuals addicted to cocaine face great difficulty in suppressing theirdrive to consume cocaine even long after their previous use of the drug.

As physical therapist with PhD training in orthopaedic biomechanics Ihave rigorous training in the evaluation and treatment of how people move in order to reduce tissue injury andpain. An emerging field of research indicates that changes in the central nervous system (CNS) contribute topain in patients with orthopaedic injuries such as tendinopathy. Yet the current standard of care for Achillestendinopathy does not evaluate or treat CNS pain mechanisms. We propose 2 independent studies to test howaltered processing within the CNS contributes to chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT) pain.K99 phase study: Specific Aim 1.1 compares measures of altered central processing in patients with chronicAT to adults without chronic pain; Specific Aim 1.2 determines which indicators of altered central processingpersist after a local anesthetic injection eliminates peripheral nociception at the site of AT pain in patientswith chronic AT.R00 phase study: Specific Aim 2.1 examines if the addition of pain education to an exercise program for ATis more effective at reducing pain and disability than exercise alone using an randomized controlled trial (RCT)design; Specific Aim 2.2 determines which indicators of altered central processing are improved by theaddition of pain education to an exercise intervention.The University of Iowa is a research-intensive university that facilitates my ability to obtain mentorship fromleaders in the field of pain research to collaborate with experts in clinical care and biostatistics and to workwithin an academic medical center to facilitate recruitment and data collection. The short-term goals for theK99 phase of this career development award are two-fold: first to obtain much-needed didactic courseworkand experience in the evaluation of pain mechanisms; and second is to obtain training in the design andconduct of a high quality RCT using an educational intervention in combination with exercise to treat chronictendinopathy pain. To achieve these goals I have identified 4 key objectives: 1) Gain greater knowledge aboutthe neurobiology of pain mechanisms; 2) Gain experience in the conduct and design of an RCT; 3) Learnabout psychological factors that contribute to pain & develop a pain education intervention; and 4) Learn aboutand participate in statistical analysis of RCT data. The long-term goal for the R00 phase is to implement theRCT techniques learned during the K99 phase. Thus this career development plan is designed to help mesucceed in my career goal as a tenure-track professor in a top-ranked research-intensive institution.Ultimately I would like to perform research that can improve clinical care of individuals with chronicmusculoskeletal pain to translate this research to clinical practice and to train future clinician-scientists.","Academic Medical Centers;Adult;Affect;Ankle;Area;Award;Back;Biomechanics;Biometry;Caring;Chronic;Chronic Care;Clinical;Collaborations;Data;Data Collection;Debridement;Development;Development Plans;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Educational Intervention;Evaluation;Exercise;Fright;Future;General Population;Goals;Incidence;Individual;Injections;Injury;Institution;Intervention;Iowa;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knowledge;Learning;Local Anesthetics;Measures;Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08);Mentors;Mentorship;Movement;Musculoskeletal;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Neuraxis;Neurobiology;Nociception;Nociceptors;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orthopedics;Pain;Pain Research;Pain Threshold;Pain management;Patients;Pattern;Peripheral;Phase;Physical therapy;Predictive Factor;Prevention;Process;Psychological Factors;Psychosocial Factor;Randomized Controlled Trials;Research;Research Training;Resolution;SF-36;Scientist;Severities;Site;Source;Statistical Data Interpretation;Techniques;Tendinopathy;Tendon structure;Testing;Thinking;Time;Training;Translating;Ultrasonography;Universities;Work;achilles tendon;base;career;career development;central sensitization;chronic musculoskeletal pain;chronic pain;clinical care;clinical practice;conditioned pain modulation;design;disability;effective intervention;exercise intervention;exercise program;experience;improved;muscle strength;novel;pain catastrophizing;pain inhibition;pain reduction;physical therapist;pressure;professor;randomized controlled design;recruit;standard of care;success;targeted treatment;tenure track;tissue injury;treatment strategy;trial design","Mechanism-based treatment approach to chronic tendinopathy pain","Project NarrativeThe standard of care for chronic tendinopathy primarily targets a localized area of tendon pain but this strategyis ineffective for up to 40% of patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy.

Long-term memory consolidation requires the induction of gene expression in a specific temporalpattern. Newly synthesized transcripts are translated and folded into functional proteins and then trafficked tothe correct cellular location. Dysfunction in any of these steps can lead to memory impairment and may bedysregulated in disease conditions although the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. My long-term goal is to determine the specific molecular mechanisms through which the Nr4A sub-family regulates geneexpression to control long-term memory in order to develop therapeutic tools to treat AD which I will pursue asan independent investigator at a research-focused institution. The overall objective of this proposal is todetermine the mechanisms that link transcriptional regulation and protein folding during memory formation andhow the disruption of these processes contributes to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. My centralhypothesis is that Nr4A regulates genes in specific cell types to facilitate protein folding and memory formation.I will test this through the following three aims: Specific Aim 1 (K99): identify cell-type specific transcriptionalsignatures of memory and identify direct gene targets of Nr4A during memory consolidation using a single-cellRNA sequencing approach; Specific Aim 2 (K99): determine the role of an Nr4A target the protein foldingchaperone Hspa5 in memory consolidation and identify its downstream protein targets; Specific Aim 3 (R00):determine the effect of activating Nr4A transcription factors on memory deficits and gene expression in a mousemodel of Alzheimer's disease. This project provides training in cutting-edge research skills includingcomputational analysis of single cell data and chromatin enrichment in memory research. The University of Iowais home to experts on memory computational psychiatry neurodegeneration and molecular biology and thecollaborative environment provides an ideal setting in which to obtain the necessary skills that will allow me totransition into a successful independent research career. As such during the mentored (K99) phase I willengage in activities designed to prepare me to successfully achieve independence including training in scientificpresentations laboratory management skills grant writing tools scientific peer-review and interview/applicationpreparation.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTMusculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among the most frequent and costly nonfatal work-related injuries andillnesses across virtually all US industry sectors. Responding to the clear need emphasized in the NIOSHNational Research Agenda for Musculoskeletal Health to develop improved methods of estimating exposure tooccupational risk factors for MSDs this research will validate new software for measuring worker postures andmovements using only standard video as input. The software leverages major advances in computer visionand machine learning sciences that only recently have enabled measurement of human postures in threedimensional space using standard two dimensional video or image sources. Ultimately one of our long-termgoals is to develop applications for occupational safety and health practitioners analogous to widely-used directreading instruments for assessing exposure to occupational hazards (e.g. sound pressure meters and gasmonitors). In this initial R21 we propose to validate the postural data our software produces (Aim 1) andexamine agreement between postural information output by our software and that output by more traditional(but time-consuming) observation-based video analyses (Aim 2). In Aim 1 participants will perform a repetitivearm-intensive task involving reaching to and manipulating knobs mounted to a fixture located in front of thebody. We will then estimate the accuracy of neck shoulder elbow wrist trunk and knee angulardisplacements (i.e. posture over time) measured by our software compared to data simultaneously collectedusing an optical motion capture system. Experimental variables include the range of motion required ofparticipants to perform the task and the configuration of the camera used to record video of participants duringthe task. Results from Aim 1 will provide critical information about the performance of our new software neededto inform best-practices for implementation in field-capable exposure assessment applications. In Aim 2 wewill reanalyze >1000 workplace videos obtained during the course of a previous prospective study of upperextremity MSDs among manufacturing workers. Analyses are proposed to assess the inter-method agreementbetween automated video analyses (our software) and analyses completed by trained specialist observersduring the course of the prospective study. Results will provide evidence that our software can quantifyoccupational exposure to MSD risk factors at a fraction of time needed to perform commonly used observation-based analyses.

"Biotechnology; Genetics","Project Summary/AbstractSkeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a consequence of many chronic diseases and conditions such asdisuse. Central to the process of muscle atrophy is protein degradation for which the E3 ubiquitinligases are critical in targeting specific proteins for degradation. The roles of many E3 ubiquitinligases in muscle are unknown and specific substrates have yet to be identified. The overall objectiveof this proposal is to determine the role of the E3 ligase F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 22(Fbxl22) in skeletal muscle atrophy. My central hypothesis is that Fbxl22 is necessary for theprocess of muscle atrophy. Robust preliminary data supports this hypothesis: 1) Fbxl22 mRNAexpression is induced after 3 days in a model of neurogenic muscle atrophy 2) Overexpression ofFbxl22 in hindlimb muscles results in significant elevations of total ubiquitinated proteins. I proposetwo specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the functional role of Fbxl22 isoforms in skeletal muscle atrophyinjury and regrowth. I will address this aim using knockdown and overexpression of Fbxl22 geneisoforms in a model of neurogenic muscle atrophy and assess Fbxl22 isoform expression in an acutemuscle injury model. Specific Aim 2: To identify substrate targets for Fbxl22-dependent ubiquitination. I willaddress this aim using a combined approach of Fbxl22 gene manipulation with proteomics analysisand post-translational modification identification of ubiquitin motifs on Fbxl22-dependent substrates. With the completion of this proposal I expect to have identified novel mechanisms forunderstanding the muscle atrophy process. By identifying the mechanisms of skeletal muscleatrophy we can explore new therapeutic strategies for improving an individuals quality of life wheremuscle wasting is present. The University of Iowa has a longstanding history of support to its trainees and junior faculty.My mentor Prof. Bodine is a world leader in skeletal muscle physiology atrophy and hypertrophy.This K01 award will expand my research skills in ubiquitin proteomics and skeletal muscle atrophy.These tools may enable the identification of new therapeutic strategies for alleviating the detrimentalimpact of skeletal muscle wasting.","Acute;Address;Affect;Aging;Atrophic;Chronic Disease;Complex;Data;Denervation;Direct Lytic Factors;Disease;Electroporation;Exercise;F Box Domain;Faculty;Family member;Fasting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Hindlimb;Homeostasis;Hospitalization;Human Genome;Hypertrophy;Individual;Injury;Iowa;Leucine;Mediating;Mentored Research Scientist Development Award;Mentors;Modeling;Molecular;Muscle;Muscle Fibers;Muscle Proteins;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Myocardium;Myogenic Regulatory Factors;Myogenin;Myopathy;Nerve Crush;Phenotype;Plasmids;Play;Positioning Attribute;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Promoter Regions;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Proteomics;Quality of life;RNA Interference;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Skeletal Development;Skeletal Muscle;Stimulus;Structure;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Universities;alpha Actinin;base;filamin;genetic manipulation;improved;in vivo;knock-down;leucine-rich repeat protein;mRNA Expression;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;muscle form;muscle physiology;myogenesis;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;protein degradation;skeletal muscle wasting;skills;tool;treatment strategy;ubiquitin-protein ligase","The role of Fbxl22 in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass","Project NarrativeThe loss of skeletal muscle mass can occur through genetic or external factors such as disease hospitalizationor aging; and affects the quality of life for millions of people.

"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases","Abstract:Filoviruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV) are found on the skin's surface at late times of infectionwhen viremia is high. Evidence indicates that skin-associated virus is an important source ofvirus transmitted to others. Yet how virus arrives at the surface is not well understood. Ourpreliminary studies suggest that EBOV can traffic to the surface of the skin by infecting bothdermal and epidermal cell populations within the skin and that this route of virus delivery to theskin's surface is important in vivo. Yet which cells within the skin support filovirus replicationand are principally responsible for virus load are unknown. Here we seek to understand EBOVinteractions with skin as it egresses from the body. We will also evaluate if EBOV is able toenter through the intact or abraded skin surface. We hypothesize that direct infection of cellswithin the skin serves as an important route of EBOV transmission. To examine this we will testthe following aims. Purified primary skin cells (e.g. keratinocytes fibroblasts and antigenpresenting cells) will be examined for their support of EBOV infection and we will determine ifthese same populations are infected in skin explants. Further we will determine if known cellsurface receptors are expressed in permissive skin cells and explants and if inhibition of virusinteractions with those receptors blocks EBOV infection. We will also assess the timing of skininvolvement in EBOV infection in vivo in mice and in macaques. At the completion of theseimportant studies an understanding of EBOV interactions with skin will be developed and a newmodel platform will be established for studying filovirus infections of highly relevant humantissue.","Africa;Animal Model;Animals;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antiviral Therapy;Apical;Autopsy;Bathing;Biological;Cell Surface Receptors;Cells;Dermal;Dermis;Disease Outbreaks;Ebola virus;Epidemic;Epidermis;Event;Family;Fibroblasts;Filoviridae Infections;Filovirus;Human;Individual;Infection;Infectious Skin Diseases;Interruption;Lesion;Macaca;Measures;Mediating;Modality;Modeling;Mus;Palliative Care;Pathway interactions;Patients;Petechiae;Population;Predisposition;Production;Property;Public Health;Reporting;Research;Route;Sampling;Satellite Viruses;Skin;Source;Supporting Cell;Surface;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Vaccines;Viral Antigens;Viral Load result;Viral load measurement;Viremia;Virion;Virus;Virus Diseases;acute care;cell type;human tissue;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;keratinization;keratinocyte;mortality;nonhuman primate;pathogen;public health priorities;receptor;success;trafficking;transmission process;uptake;viral transmission","Modeling Filovirus Infection of and Trafficking through Skin","The skin is a barrier to many pathogens; however Ebola virus is found on the surface of skin atlate times of infection.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Childhood Injury; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Pediatric; Prevention; Unintentional Childhood Injury","Project SummaryTeen drivers are three times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than adult drivers. Several factorscontribute to increased crash risk among novice teen drivers including distracted driving inexperienceheightened risk taking and an underdeveloped ability to identify potential roadway hazards. Potential hazardsrefer to emerging threats on or near the roadway (e.g. the car in front of you braking suddenly due to apedestrian darting into traffic) which may or may not evolve into an actual hazard or crash. Experienced driversquickly identify and respond to potential hazards with little to no effortful cognition. Novice drivers needrepeated experience in the perception of hazards to effectively identify and respond to potential hazards yetfail to develop this skill during the learner phase of licensure. We hypothesize that this experience can behastened with specific parental guidance. As primary supervisors and teachers during the learner phase oflicensure parents are well positioned to teach their children to identify latent hazards in the drivingenvironment. However research on driving supervision indicates this type of instruction is almost completelyabsent. The overall goal of the current project is to improve parental instruction and practice surrounding theseevents. The first aim of this proposal is to describe parent-teen conversations about hazard identification andmitigation while parents and teens jointly engage in a perceptual/adaptive learning module  a hazardanticipation training program delivered via video. We hypothesize that parents will vary in how they scaffoldteens ability to correctly identify and perceive hazards according to individual differences in teen temperamentparenting style and family communication pattern. The second aim seeks to develop a hazard anticipationtraining program to teach parents to better communicate with their children about identifying potential hazardson the roadway. To this end we will modify an existing training program designed to help drivers anticipatehazards on the roadway to help improve parents communication related to these events. For the third andfinal aim we will test the impact of the intervention in a state-of-the-art driving simulator the NADS-1. Wehypothesize that compared to controls parents exposed to the intervention will show improved high-orderdriving instruction - applicable to the current and future driving environment. We also hypothesize that teens ofparents exposed to the intervention the will look to and respond to potential hazards on the roadway morequickly and reliably than those assigned to the control. My graduate training in parent-child communication myMPH which trained me in population-level primary prevention and my postdoctoral fellowship in simulationresearch have prepared me to begin this interdisciplinary research. This K99/R01 award will equip me with thenecessary training and skills in intervention development implementation and evaluation to achieve the aimsset forth in this proposal.

"Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/AbstractThe purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to support my short-termcareer objective of determining if dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is an early pathologicalfeature of HD by quantitatively characterizing functional connections between brain regions that regulate theANS in children with the gene expansion that causes HD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). I will alsoinvestigate unique physiologic measures of ANS function and early effects on the vascular system in theseparticipants. ANS dysfunction has been described in adult patients with HD but it has been thought that this isa secondary complication of neurodegeneration. However I recently discovered that children carrying the HDgene expansion that causes HD (GE children) exhibit symptoms consistent with enhanced sympathetic tonedecades prior to their predicted motor onset. These findings indicate that ANS dysfunction may be one of theearliest manifestations of neurodegeneration in HD. As a result the ANS may be a therapeutic target for diseasemodification of HD but more information is required. The ANS is highly regulated by cortical brain regions thatcomprise the Central Autonomic Network (CAN) and cortical thinning and atrophy have been well-described inHD. However there are no published reports that have objectively characterized the integrity of the functionalconnections in the CAN in HD. I will perform resting-state and tasked functional MRI on GE children tocharacterize the function of the CAN at different stages of the disease. This experiment will test the specifichypothesis that quantitative changes in functional integrity of the CAN are apparent decades prior to the predictedmotor onset of HD. Additionally I will explore physiologic measure of ANS dysfunction including baroreflexsensitivity (BRS) and how this relates to the function of the vascular system early in the disease course of HD.Specifically I will measure aortic stiffness and carotid artery compliance while also measuring cerebral bloodflow using arterial spin labeling to test the hypotheses that relative to healthy control children GE children willdemonstrate increased aortic stiffness decreased BRS and decreased cerebral blood flow. These experimentswill provide vital information regarding when ANS dysfunction occurs in HD the underlying mechanismscausing the dysfunction and if these changes have negative effects on the cardiovascular system earlyin the disease course. I have a unique background that positions me well to be a successful translationalscientist. Further training is required in sophisticated neuroimaging methods neurodevelopment andneurobiology as well as biostatistics. The proposed integrated research world-class mentorship team anddidactic training programs will ensure my short-term and long-term success.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention; Sleep Research","Project Summary / AbstractSleep disorders and obesity are inextricably linked  poor sleep quality and short sleep duration increase therisk of developing obesity while obesity is an independent risk factor for chronic sleep disruption (CSD) andexcessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Despite a clear bidirectional and pernicious association between obesityand sleep disorders the neural substrates mediating this association remain largely unknown. Our researchprogram seeks to identify critical neural circuit linking metabolic alterations to CSD and EDS. Our long-termgoal is to delineate the neural circuits underlying metabolic regulation of sleep-wake behavior. We haverecently found that adipocyte-derived metabolic hormone leptin promotes wakefulness and chemogeneticactivation of a subset of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) expressing leptin receptor(LepR) completely disrupts sleep in mice. The overall objective of this research proposal is to clarify how leptinacts on key hypothalamic neurons to affect normal sleep-wake cycle. Build upon strong preliminary data thecentral hypothesis is that circulating leptin acts on a subset of LHA LepR-expressing GABAergic neurons toaffect sleep-wake behavior through their projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and/or preoptic area(POA) and thereby contribute to CSD and EDS commonly associated with obesity. We will test our hypothesisby pursuing following two specific aims: 1) determine if the LHA is a key site mediating the action of leptin onsleep-wake regulation and 2) determine if leptin engages LHAVTA and/or LHAPOA circuits to regulatesleep-wake behavior. Advanced neuroscience techniques will be employed to answer these questionsincluding Cre/loxP technology optogenetics/chemogenetics in vivo fiber photometry and electrophysiologycoupled with chronic wireless recording of EEG/EMG in freely moving animals. The proposed research issignificant because it is expected to not only advance and our understanding of hypothalamic regulation ofsleep-wake behavior but also shed light on largely unknown mechanisms that connect metabolic disorders tosleep-wake regulation. The proposed research is also innovative because it utilizes a combination of state-of-art neuroscience techniques coupled with sophisticated physiological measurements to address an importantyet largely under-investigated question  what are the underlying neural circuits mediating CSD and EDS inobesity? Such knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of a novel strategy to effectively managesleep problems associated with obesity in human patients.","Address;Adipocytes;Affect;Animals;Attenuated;Behavior;Brain;Brain Mapping;Brain region;Cardiovascular Physiology;Chronic;Coupled;Cre-LoxP;Data;Development;Diurnal Rhythm;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Excessive Daytime Sleepiness;Exhibits;Fiber;Goals;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Investigation;Knowledge;Lateral Hypothalamic Area;Lead;Leptin;Leptin resistance;Light;Link;Literature;LoxP-flanked allele;Measurement;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic hormone;Motor Activity;Mus;Neurons;Neurosciences;Obese Mice;Obesity;Patients;Periodicity;Photometry;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Preoptic Areas;Productivity;Publishing;Regulation;Research;Research Proposals;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Sleep;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Fragmentations;Sleep Wake Cycle;Sleep disturbances;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Ventral Tegmental Area;Viral;Wakefulness;Weight Gain;Wireless Technology;Work;base;cardiometabolic risk;cell type;diet-induced obesity;energy balance;excessive weight gain;feeding;in vivo;innovation;leptin receptor;neural circuit;novel;novel strategies;obesity development;optogenetics;poor sleep;prevent;programs;receptor;relating to nervous system;sleep onset;sleep quality;sleep regulation","Decoding brain circuit underlying metabolic regulation of sleep-wake behavior","Project NarrativeObesity is commonly associated with chronic sleep disruption and excessive daytime sleepiness whichsignificantly increase the cardiometabolic risk and reduce the productivity at work.

"Aging; Biodefense; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Nanotechnology; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTAge-related defects of the immune response contribute to reduced efficacy of the influenza vaccine in olderadults. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection results in greater risk of complications and higher hospitalization ratesin older adults with approximately 90% of deaths occurring in adults over age 65. Therefore the developmentof a safe and effective vaccine that promotes protective immunity for the aged is an urgent public health need.The overall goal of this revised R01 application is to identify the effect of vaccine biomaterials and adjuvants onDC metabolism and subsequent effects on antibody and T cell memory to develop a nanovaccine to overcomeage-related immune impairments. Vaccines for older adults can be further optimized with biomaterials thatenhance multiple arms of the immune system and provide a platform to expand antigen selection broadeningprotection. Our studies will establish the contribution of specific biomaterials and adjuvants in improving B andT cell outcomes resulting in protection by enhancing vaccine efficacy. The goals are to: 1) develop anefficacious influenza nanovaccine for older populations; and 2) to understand the mechanisms by whichrational selection of biomaterials and co-adjuvants in vaccines can enhance immune capabilities of agedindividuals. Our two polymeric nanovaccine platforms polyanhydride nanoparticles and pentablock copolymermicelles have been shown to increase antibody titers improve cell-mediated immunity and prolong antigendelivery resulting in a protective immune response with reduced viral load upon delivery of recombinanthemagglutinin and nucleoprotein in an IAV challenge model. Compelling preliminary data demonstrates thatthese formulations differentially alter dendritic cell (DC) metabolic profile compared to traditional adjuvants. Aim1 will identify how nanovaccine biomaterials and adjuvants that promote DC metabolic health augment theimmune response in aged mice. Different vaccine formulations will compare adjuvants that produce highglycolytic responses with formulations that retain some oxidative phosphorylation and spare respiratorycapacity to optimize DC function. In the second aim we will optimize the nanovaccine formulation(s) thatenhance B cell activation in aged mice and peripheral blood B cells from aged humans. Additionally we willidentify mechanisms by which our nanovaccine improves T follicular helper responses and the induction ofprotective immunity on an aging background. Traditional inactivated IAV vaccine will be used as a control so asto identify the formulation providing superior protection than the current vaccine.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Human Genome; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences","Project Summary / AbstractIn the hours after learning the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern producing transientwaves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e.epigenetic) events including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones the DNA itselfand the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally the molecular changes necessary for memory require aform of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes the long-lasting regulation of gene expressionduring memory storage fails and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatricdisorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage andsynaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications in thedevelopment of single-cell RNA technology and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by smallnoncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in thenucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associatedwith spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data toidentify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediatedmRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation linking synapticactivity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis ofour proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigeneticmechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1 we will examine the impact of a novel histonemodification histone crotonylation on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memoryconsolidation. In Specific Aim 2 we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampalneurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3 we will elucidate the microRNA-dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNAprocessing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in theconsolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of newtreatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophreniaautism bipolar disorder post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.","ATAC-seq;Acetyl Coenzyme A;Acetylation;Acyl Coenzyme A;Acylation;Bipolar Disorder;Cell Nucleus;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Coenzyme A;Cognitive deficits;Complex;DNA;Data;Defect;Development;Dorsal;Epigenetic Process;Event;Funding;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Histone Acetylation;Histones;Hour;Individual;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Link;Machine Learning;Mediating;Memory;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Neurons;Neurosciences;Nuclear RNA;Pattern;Pharmacology;Positioning Attribute;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Process;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Research;Ribonucleases;Role;Schizophrenia;Seminal;Source;Statistical Methods;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;System;Techniques;Technology;Time;Tissues;Translational Derepression;Translational Regulation;Translational Repression;Translations;Untranslated RNA;Up-Regulation;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;bioinformatics tool;brain tissue;cell type;combinatorial;epigenetic regulation;experimental study;frontier;histone modification;insight;knock-down;long term memory;memory consolidation;memory retrieval;new therapeutic target;non-genetic;novel;novel therapeutics;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics","Epigenetic Mechanisms of Memory Storage","Project NarrativeThe regulation of specific genes critical to the storage of memories (memory consolidation) and changes inneuronal function (plasticity) vital for learning are controlled by a number of mechanisms that are notthemselves regulated by genetics.

"Aging; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","PROJECT SUMMARYTissue homeostasis depends upon the regulated production of differentiated cells to replacethose that are damaged or defective. Homeostasis declines with age largely because ofdecreases in stem cell number and/or function. To intervene in the aging process it is critical tounderstand mechanisms involved in stem cell homeostasis. We discovered that paradigmaticDrosophila female germline stem cells (fGSCs) use a non-canonical mode of mitosis whereinthe nuclear envelope and nuclear lamina remain throughout mitosis. In this mode mitoticspindles are nucleated from centrosomes embedded in the retained nuclear lamina. This modeof mitosis has gone unrecognized due to the rarity of stem cell divisions and the globallyaccepted assumption that metazoan mitoses involve nuclear lamina dispersal. As such how themitotic nuclear lamina impacts asymmetric stem cell divisions and stem cell maintenance isunknown. The long-term goal of these studies is to define contributions of the mitotic nuclearlamina to fGSC homeostasis during aging. We capitalize on this natural in vivo stem cellpopulation that demonstrates rapid age-dependent declines in stem cell functions to addresstwo aims. Aim 1 will define how biological aging affects the mitotic nuclear lamina. Aim 2 willdefine the role of the nuclear lamina checkpoint kinases in physiological aging. Experiments inthis proposal will establish contributions of the newly identified mitotic nuclear lamina to stemcell maintenance. These studies have the potential to provide insights into lamin associateddiseases such as progeria and provide insights to advance therapeutics that delay oreliminate stem cell loss during natural aging.","ATR gene;Address;Affect;Age;Aging;Biological Aging;Biosensor;CHEK2 gene;Cell Count;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Maintenance;Cell division;Cells;Centrosome;Cessation of life;Data;Daughter;Deterioration;Development;Disease;Dissection;Drosophila genus;Exhibits;Failure;Female;Female infertility;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Future;Generations;Goals;Homeostasis;Human;Impairment;Lamins;Mitosis;Mitotic;Mitotic spindle;Molecular;Monitor;Morphology;Nuclear;Nuclear Envelope;Nuclear Lamina;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Premature aging syndrome;Process;Production;Progeria;Proteins;Role;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;adult stem cell;age effect;age related;defined contribution;experimental study;falls;germline stem cells;in vivo;injured;insight;invention;mutant;novel;self-renewal;stem cell aging;stem cell division;stem cell function;stem cell homeostasis;stem cell population;stem cell proliferation;stem cells;tool","Aging and the nuclear lamina in mitotic stem cells","PROJECT NARRATIVEProminent changes in nuclear morphology occur during physiological aging and in age-enhanced diseases such as laminopathies.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Hearing Loss; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rehabilitation","Project SummaryCochlear implant (CI) electrode arrays are made of platinum (Pt) wires and contacts encased inpolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS silicone) housing. These materials provide mechanical stability and flexibilitycritical to the long-term function of the device. However they also induce a foreign body response and fibrosisthat have detrimental effects. For example the fibrotic capsule that eventually encases all CI electrode arraysleads to increased impedances and signal broadening which decreases the effectiveness of the device.Further intracochlear fibrosis is implicated in the loss of acoustic hearing that can occur months to years afterimplantation. As candidacy for CI is rapidly expanding including many patients with significant residualhearing there is an urgent need to understand the fundamental processes that lead to intracochlear fibrosis.Macrophages are recognized as key central regulators of the foreign body response to biomaterials in othertissues and our preliminary data demonstrate vigorous macrophage recruitment following implantation of CIs.We hypothesize CI biomaterials activate macrophages leading to the recruitment of fibroblasts andfibrosis/encapsulation of the biomaterials and that electrical stimulation modulates this macrophage responsedependent on the stimulus level and timing of onset. In Aim 1 in vitro culture models are used to explore thedifferential effect of PDMS and Pt on macrophage recruitment activation and regulation of cochlear fibroblastproliferative and synthetic functions. Aim 1 also investigates the temporal and spatial activation and recruitmentof macrophages following cochlear implantation using a reporter mouse model. Aim 2 examines the role ofmacrophages in fibrosis/neo-ossification following cochlear implantation. First we test the requirement ofmacrophages for intracochlear fibrosis following CI using a mouse line that allows conditional and selectivedepletion of macrophages. Next implanted mice are treated with a specific CSF1R inhibitor to depletemacrophages as a preclinical translational model. Finally a CX3CR1 null mouse is used to determine theeffect of fractalkine signaling on post-CI fibrosis. Aim 3 determines the effects of varying levels of electricalstimulation and effects of timing of electrical stimulation onset on macrophage recruitment and intracochlearfibrosis. The proposed work provides a rigorous investigation of the effects that specific biomaterials insertiontrauma and electrical stimulation exert on macrophage responses and the regulation of the fibrosis in thecochlea. The long-term impact of the work is to identify specific effective and durable strategies to limitfibrosis following CI or other injuries to the cochlea.","3-Dimensional;Acoustics;Action Potentials;Adhesions;Affect;Architecture;Auditory Brainstem Responses;Biocompatible Materials;Biological;CSF1R gene;Cells;Charge;Cicatrix;Clinical;Cochlea;Cochlear Implants;Cochlear implant procedure;Collagen;Data;Devices;Ear;Effectiveness;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Electrophysiology (science);Encapsulated;Environment;Equipment Malfunction;Evaluation;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Foreign Bodies;Foreign-Body Reaction;Fractalkine;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;Goals;Health;Hearing;Housing;Implant;Implanted Electrodes;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;Intervention;Investigation;Knockout Mice;Lead;Life;Macrophage Activation;Measures;Mechanics;Modeling;Mus;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Osteogenesis;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Physiologic Ossification;Platinum;Play;Process;Property;Reaction;Regulation;Reporter;Residual state;Role;Scala Tympani;Signal Transduction;Silicones;Stimulus;Surface;Surface Properties;System;Testing;Therapeutic Studies;Time;Tissues;Trauma;Work;X ray microscopy;base;capsule;chemokine;confocal imaging;density;electric impedance;experimental study;flexibility;implantation;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;macrophage;microscopic imaging;mouse model;negative affect;otoacoustic emission;platinum electrode;polydimethylsiloxane;pre-clinical;preservation;recruit;response;translational model","Role of Macrophages on Tissue Remodeling Following Cochlear Implantation","Project Narrative: Cochlear implants are one of the most successful biological implants and while thesedevices provide hearing to people who have lost significant hearing most ears implanted with a CI haveinflammatory reactions to the device that negatively affects their performance.

"Cancer; Hematology; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT: Career Enhancement Program (CEP). The goal of the University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE (SPORE) Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to provide support (both financial support and extensive mentorship) to highly promising well-trained scientists interested in pursuing a career in translational lymphoma research. The CEP allows for the support each year of two highly promising investigators who are engaged in SPORE research. The extensive research and training base available at these two institutions as well as the infrastructure of the SPORE provides an outstanding foundation for the SPORE CEP. Successful candidates for the SPORE CEP are typically young investigators (senior postdoctoral fellows about to begin their faculty careers and young faculty) in translational multidisciplinary basic clinical or population-based lymphoma research. On occasion the CEP is used to assist more experienced successful investigators interested in shifting their research focus toward translational lymphoma research. The SPORE CEP provides $50000 for one year ($25000 from SPORE funds and institutional support of $25000 from the University of Iowa or Mayo Clinic resources) for each of two awards per year. A second year of support is possible based on progress and successful re-competition. During this most recent funding period (years 11- 15) 10 investigators including two under-represented minority faculty and four women received CEP awards and were each supported for 1 year. They all remain active translational investigators in the field of lymphoid malignancies with 9 of the 10 still involved with the SPORE and the 10th a successful investigator at another institution. The CEP awardee (Gupta) from a previous funding period was a co-leader on the current Project 3. In this renewal application another CEP awardee (Feldman) has become Project 1 co-leader and also Director of the Biospecimens Core. The research of Dr. Z. Yang was important to the proposed Project 1 and Dr. Asmann's research has led to her role in the Biospecimens and Bioinformatics Core in this renewal. During the next funding period the SPORE will maintain: (1) a stringent candidate selection system that encourages applications from minorities and women; (2) comprehensive trainee guidance by a mentor; (3) support through a scientific mentor group (the Individual Trainee Mentorship Committee) comprised of investigators with expertise in each trainee's area of interest; (4) multi-disciplinary research courses and on-going training activities such as the Multidisciplinary Cancer Seminar Series and Lymphoma Group meetings at both sites; (5) encouragement of collaboration with investigator group meetings at both sites; (6) encouragement of collaboration with investigators at both Iowa and Mayo and (7) opportunities for further research enhancement through the Developmental Research Program and full Projects.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and has a highly variable clinical course. Asymptomatic and low-tumor burden patients can initially be managed by observation or rituximab-monotherapy while symptomatic and high-tumor burden patients are typically managed at diagnosis with immunochemotherapy (IC) as standard of care. We have shown that IC-treated FL patients who achieve event-free (i.e. no disease progression or re-treatment) status at 24 months after diagnosis (EFS24) have the subsequent life expectancy of the background age and sex matched general population while those who fail to achieve EFS24 have aggressive disease with poor outcomes. One of the highest priorities for the new NCI-driven paradigm for progress in FL is to address early events in FL including understanding the underlying biology identifying prognostic and predictive markers and ultimately developing new therapeutic targets and management strategies for these patients. We hypothesize that a novel combination of germline (host) and somatic (tumor) genomic biomarkers tumor gene expression and clinical factors can improve our ability to predict at diagnosis which IC-treated FL patients will have an early clinical failure defined as failure to achieve EFS24. To test this hypothesis we propose to identify validate and clinically translate germline genetic biomarkers (Aim 1) somatic tumor genomic biomarkers (Aim 2) and gene expression signatures (Aim 3) for failure to achieve EFS24 in IC-treated FL and then develop and validate a novel integrative model (Aim 4) that combines clinical prognostic factors with the biomarkers identified from Aims 1-3. To address these aims we have assembled an outstanding interdisciplinary team with extensive expertise in the proposed studies. The study leverages the established resources of the Lymphoma SPORE our horizontal collaborations (LLMPP SWOG LYSA) and our leadership in the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort. Our innovative population science project will be the first to comprehensively discover and validate germline genetic tumor genomic and gene expression biomarkers for failure to achieve EFS24. We have designed studies that have high internal validity with a focus on use of large patient cohorts with high quality biospecimens clinical and outcome data; extensive quality control in biologic sample handling and assays; and multi-stage studies with external validation of results including use of a geographically and racially/ethnically diverse sample of IC-treated FL patients from the LEO cohort study which also enhances the generalizability of our results. Our comprehensive approach of discovery-validation and clinical translation should yield a reliable multiparameter prognostic model with potential for major impact on the management of IC-treated FL patients with the ultimate goal of accurate personalized patient management as well as new insights into lymphoma biology that can also aid in identification of therapeutic targets.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Hematology; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT: Project 3. A key feature of lymphomas is the glucose hypermetabolism visualized on FDG-PET imaging. In Project 3 (P3) we are investigating two novel drivers of glucose uptake and utilization. Our preliminary data have revealed that abnormal glucose uptake is a striking feature of B cells deficient in the signaling adaptor protein TNFR-associated factor 3 (TRAF3). Indeed ~30% of DLBCL samples have histologic evidence of TRAF3 deficiency. We also found that the multi-functional glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) is increased in lymphoma cells. B cell TRAF3 in the nucleus promotes the degradation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) transcriptional complex and the CREB pro-survival targets Mcl-1 Pim2 and c-Myc are elevated in TRAF3-deficient B cells. In addition the CREB and NF-B2 targets Glut1 and hexokinase 2 (HXK2) are also elevated in TRAF3-deficient B cells (as is glucose metabolism) and these cells have increased GSK3 expression. Interfering with GSK3 either by GSK3/ knockouts that we developed or by inhibiting the GSK3 with a novel inhibitor 9ING-41 (Actuate Therapeutics) inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis while sparing normal lymphocytes. Thus there is an important link between the TRAF3 and GSK3 pathways that can potentially be exploited for therapeutic benefit. The overall hypothesis of P3 is that targeting the hyperactive metabolic pathways induced by dysregulation of key signaling pathways in lymphoma cells (TRAF3 deficiency; GSK3 hyperactivity) will provide a new approach to treatment that will enhance established therapies. We have organized this work into 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1. Determine how TRAF3 deficiency regulates survival and glucose metabolism in pre-malignant  and malignant B cells. Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of action of GSK3 inhibitors in lymphoma cells to develop rational  combinations for clinical trials. Aim 3: Conduct clinical trials of novel inhibitors of tumor metabolism in patients with relapsed lymphoma. P3 is addressing a significant unmet need in lymphoma biology and therapeutics  understanding and targeting the pathways and mechanisms of the increased glucose metabolism that characterizes almost all aggressive lymphomas at diagnosis and those tumors that fail initial therapy and become refractory. We are approaching this problem in lymphoma biology and treatment with a team experienced in the study of lymphoma biology signal transduction pathway analysis and clinical trials experience with signal transduction pathway inhibitors. Within the 5 years of this Project we aim to translate new biomarkers and therapies to our patients with glucose-avid lymphomas and spur new research into this important area.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Affect;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;B-Lymphocytes;Behavior;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;CREBBP gene;Catchment Area;Cell Line;Cell Nucleus;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Characteristics;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Complex;Conduct Clinical Trials;Cyclic AMP-Responsive DNA-Binding Protein;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease remission;Drosophila pros protein;Fluorine;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Glucose;Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3;Glycogen Synthase Kinases;Growth;Hexokinase 2;Histologic;Human;Hyperactivity;Immuno-Chemotherapy;Incidence;Interleukin-6;Iowa;Knock-out;Learning;Link;Lymphocyte;Lymphoma;Lymphoma cell;Lymphomagenesis;MCL1 gene;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;Minnesota;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Nutrient;PTPN22 gene;Pancreas;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Protein Kinase;Refractory;Regulation;Relapse;Research;Research Personnel;SDZ RAD;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Systemic Therapy;T-Cell Lymphoma;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Translating;Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor;Ubiquitination;United States;Work;antitumor agent;c-myc Genes;design;experience;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;glucose metabolism;glucose uptake;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;loss of function;non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma patients;novel;novel strategies;overexpression;premalignant;recruit;resistance mechanism;response;treatment strategy;tumor;tumor growth;tumor metabolism","Project 3: Targeting Tumor Metabolism in Lymphoma","PROJECT NARRATIVE: Project 3 This Project is focused on developing new treatments for lymphoma that aim to interfere with signal pathways that drive the use of glucose.

There have been major advances in recent years enhancing our understanding of theimmune response to cancer in general and lymphoma in particular. These advances have impacted on clinicalcare. The SPORE has a long-standing interest in exploring the unique aspects of the lymphomamicroenvironment and how cross-talk between malignant lymphocytes and benign cells contributes to bothtumor growth and immunosuppression. SPORE investigators have also explored novel approaches tomodifying that microenvironment in a way that enhances antigen presentation and development of an anti-lymphoma T cell response. T-cell checkpoint blockade is creating great excitement in the overall field of cancerimmunotherapy but early phase studies indicate it has suboptimal efficacy as a single agent in non-Hodgkinlymphoma (NHL). Based on this background the underlying hypothesis of Project 2 is that modifying thelymphoma microenvironment to augment antigen release uptake and presentation will increase the lymphomaT cell response and enhance the efficacy anti-PD1 therapy of NHL. We will assess this hypothesis by exploringtwo specific aims. In the first aim we will conduct parallel clinical trials combining anti-PD1 therapy with in situimmunization based on intratumoral manipulation of the NHL microenvironment using two distinct strategies.The first strategy involves enhancing antigen release and uptake through node cryoablation followed byintratumoral injection of autologous dendritic cells (DCs). The second strategy involves enhancing antigenpresentation and T cell activation through intratumoral injection of virus-like particles (VLPs) containing a TollLike Receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist. In the second aim we will evaluate the immune response to these treatmentswith a focus on the systemic and intratumoral T cell response. Additional clinical and correlative studies will bedesigned based on lessons learned from the first set of clinical trials and correlative science. Overall thisproject will provide critical information on whether local modification of the microenvironment can enhance theoverall systemic immune response and therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy and what approach is best toachieve that goal.","Address;Aftercare;Agonist;Antigen Presentation;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antigens;Autologous;Autologous Dendritic Cells;Benign;Biometry;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Correlative Study;Cryosurgery;DNA;Dendritic Cells;Development;Effector Cell;Evaluation;Goals;Hodgkin Disease;Human;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immune response;Immunization;Immunosuppression;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Indolent;Infrastructure;Injections;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Modification;Monoclonal Antibody Therapy;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;PD-1 blockade;Patients;Phase;Phase I/II Clinical Trial;Phenotype;Refractory;Relapse;Research Personnel;Safety;Sampling;Science;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;T cell response;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Lymphoma;T-Lymphocyte;TLR9 gene;Technology;Treatment Efficacy;Tumor Antigens;Virus-like particle;anti-PD-1;anti-PD1 antibodies;anti-PD1 therapy;anti-tumor immune response;base;cancer immunotherapy;clinical care;design;immune checkpoint blockade;interest;lymph nodes;malignant lymphocyte;neoplastic cell;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;peripheral blood;randomized trial;response;translational study;treatment response;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;uptake","Project 2: Microenvironment Modification and Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy of Lymphoma","PROJECT NARRATIVE: Project 2Growing evidence suggests development of a robust anti-tumor immune response can be enhanced bymodifying the tumor microenvironment in a manner that enhances release uptake and presentation of tumorantigens to T cells.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Hematology; Immunotherapy; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT  Project 1 The mononuclear phagocyte system is critical in the host's response to pathogens and inflammation but it is also critical for removing old or malignant cells. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) monocytic cells are central components of the innate immune system and CD14+ monocytes in the peripheral blood as well as CD68+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tissue influence the prognosis of patients.  We have previously shown that CD14+HLADRlow monocytes are increased in the peripheral blood of NHL patients are induced by IL-10 and profoundly suppresses T-cell function. However in lymphoma tissue biopsies we found that many CD68+ TAMs downregulate CD14 expression. While CD14+ TAMs typically expressed common macrophage markers we found that the CD68+CD14- fraction expressed very few of these markers. To determine whether CD68+CD14- TAMs retained macrophage function we measured the expression of signal-regulatory protein  (SIRP) a receptor that inhibits phagocytic function. Based on SIRP expression we identified 2 distinct populations of TAMs in sites involved by lymphoma  those that were CD14+SIRPhigh and those that were CD14-SIRPlow/-  but the phagocytic ability and role of these two populations is unknown.  SIRP regulates macrophage-mediated removal of apoptotic cells that upregulate `eat-me' signals such as calreticulin. The induction of phagocytosis by `eat-me' signals on tumor cells is countered by `don't-eat-me' signals such as CD47 which binds macrophage SIRP to inhibit phagocytosis. CD47 has been shown to be highly expressed on lymphoma cells and is a mechanism by which malignant B-cells protect themselves from phagocytosis by activated macrophages. However CD47/SIRP interaction not only regulates phagocytosis but also has a role in modulating T-cell function by enhancing antigen presentation effectively making the CD47/SIRP axis an immune checkpoint for the innate immune system. We hypothesize that CD14+SIRPhigh TAMs are highly functional able to phagocytose malignant cells present tumor antigens and activate the immune system but are inhibited by CD47. In contrast CD14-SIRPlow/- TAMs are immature fail to phagocytose malignant cells and suppress immune function. To improve the outcome of lymphoma patients the phagocytosis and T-cell activation by both CD14+SIRPhigh and CD14-SIRPlow/- TAMs needs to be augmented. We therefore propose to determine the phagocytic function and immune activation of both CD14+SIRPhigh and CD14-SIRPlow/- TAMs and determine whether blocking CD47/SIRP signaling clinically using SIRP-Fc can enhance the tumor-directed phagocytic function of both populations of TAMs. We anticipate that results from this project will lead not only to a comprehensive understanding of the subtypes of TAMs in lymphoma but an innovative therapy that harnesses the power of both the innate and adaptive immune systems.","Adaptive Immune System;Affect;Antibodies;Antigen Presentation;Apoptotic;B-Lymphocytes;Binding;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Biopsy Specimen;CD14 gene;CD47 gene;Cell physiology;Cells;Clinical;Cytometry;Data;Development;Disease;Eating;Equilibrium;Excision;Human;Immune response;Immune system;Inflammation;Innate Immune System;Innovative Therapy;Interleukin-10;Lead;Lymphoma;Lymphoma cell;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Monitor;Mononuclear;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phagocytes;Phagocytosis;Phagocytosis Induction;Phase I Clinical Trials;Phenotype;Population;Prognosis;Role;SHPS-1 protein;Safety;Serum;Signal Transduction;Site;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;System;T-Cell Activation;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Tissues;Tumor Antigens;Tumor Subtype;Tumor-associated macrophages;anti-tumor immune response;base;calreticulin;cancer cell;cytokine;immune activation;immune function;immunosuppressive macrophages;improved;improved outcome;innate immune checkpoint;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;neoplastic cell;non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma patients;overexpression;pathogen;patient population;peripheral blood;phase I trial;receptor;tumor","Project 1: Activating Phagocytic Macrophages in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","PROJECT NARRATIVE: Project 1 Macrophage-mediated phagocytosis is an important mechanism to eliminate diseased and malignant cells. Malignant lymphoma cells by overexpressing CD47 provide a `don't-eat-me' signal and thereby avoid eradication. We propose to block CD47/SIRP signaling to restore an eat-me' message. However not all macrophages in lymphoma tumors express SIRP and we have defined populations that are CD14+SIRPhigh and those that are CD14-SIRPlow/-. We therefore propose to determine the function of these two populations to determine whether the innate phagocytic immune system targets lymphoma cells and test whether blocking an innate immune checkpoint (CD47/SIRP signaling) improves the anti-tumor immune response.","NCI","10208777","7/22/2021","PAR-14-353","5P50CA097274-20","5","P50","CA","097274","20","","","9/11/2002","6/30/2023","ZCA1-RPRB-N","5218","14090010","FAROOQ, UMAR ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","244066"," ","245411","4705"," "," ",
"Cancer; Hematology; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT: Core D: Clinical Research. The SPORE Clinical Research Core (CRC) has as its primary goal to be the direct translational link between research projects and clinical research emanating from these projects. The CRC is composed of the Clinical Trials Unit and the Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). The specific aims are to: 1) coordinate and perform SPORE clinical trial protocols; 2) manage SPORE observational epidemiology protocols and partner with the MER. The CRC provides a critical link between clinical research and the specific projects cores and developmental research. The CRC is led by the Director Thomas M. Habermann MD at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and a Co-Director Brian Link MD at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. A key function of the CRC is to coordinate the development of clinical trials assist in patient accrual manage protocol amendments report adverse events to appropriate agencies and provide comprehensive quality control on clinical trial data. For the MER the CRC consents newly diagnosed lymphoma patients abstracts and enters clinical and epidemiologic data and systematically follows all MER patients through death. The CRC is linked to other SPORE cores providing SPORE investigators integrated and centralized access for projects. During the last funding cycle the CRC has been very active with 5 trials actively accruing patients and 4 new therapeutic trials initiated; overall 161 patients were accrued to these SPORE trials. Studies of novel agents such as the mTOR inhibitor everolimus were completed and published and moved to combinations with R- CHOP in the ALLIANCE National Clinical Trials Network group with promising results. Two trials using the immunostimulatory agent CpG were completed with CpG now incorporated into a new trial in Project 2. During the last funding cycle (through June 2015) 2391 new patients were enrolled into the MER (cumulative total 7605 patients). Seminal practice-changing publications in the areas of utility of PET/CT surveillance scans in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) a new early endpoint - event-free survival (EFS24) for predicting long term DLBCL outcome and transformation of follicular lymphoma (FL) in the rituximab era all originated from CRC research. The CRC also contributed to large genome-wide association studies in lymphoma clinical observations in body mass index complementary alternative medicine and trans fatty acid intake and risk were reported. 86 manuscripts have been published from activities involving this core in the last 4 years of this funding period. The CRC has worked with each of the Project Co-Leaders to plan the new clinical trials included in Projects 1-3 and continued use of the MER in Project 4. The CRC will also work with recipients of the Developmental Research Projects and Career Enhancement Program on any clinical or biomarker trials. The CRC has been vital to success of the SPORE and looks forward to continuing to serve SPORE investigators in the next grant.","Adverse event;Amendment;Area;Award;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Blood;Blood specimen;Body mass index;Cell Survival;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Unit;Clinical trial protocol document;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Complement;Complementary and alternative medicine;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Consent;Core Facility;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease-Free Survival;Enrollment;Ensure;Epidemiology;Follicular Lymphoma;Freezing;Funding;Future;Genetic;Goals;Grant;Human;Incubators;Infrastructure;Institution;Intake;International;Investigation;Iowa;Leadership;Life Style;Link;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuscripts;Mayo Clinic Cancer Center;Mentors;Molecular Epidemiology;National Clinical Trials Network;Newly Diagnosed;Observational epidemiology;Outcome;PET/CT scan;Participant;Patients;Population Sciences;Predictive Factor;Process;Protocols documentation;Publications;Publishing;Quality Control;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resource Development;Resource Sharing;Resources;Review Committee;Risk;SDZ RAD;Scanning;Seminal;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Therapeutic Clinical Trial;Therapeutic Trials;Trans Fatty Acids;Translational Research;Tube;Universities;Vitamins Nutrition;Work;cancer epidemiology;career;chemotherapy;clinical development;cohort;cost;epidemiologic data;experience;genome wide association study;human subject;improved;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;mTOR Inhibitor;microbiome research;novel;novel therapeutics;programs;prospective;research study;rituximab;stool sample;success;treatment response;tumor","Core D: Clinical","PROJECT NARRATIVE: Core D: Clinical Research The goal of the Clinical Research Core is to support clinical research generated by SPORE investigators for patients with lymphoma.

The UI/MC SPORE Biospecimens Shared Resource provides a coordinated centralized and dedicated core for the procurement processing and annotation of biospecimens from patients with lymphoma. The goal of the Biospecimens Core is to procure a variety of biologic specimens on all patients involved in UI/MC SPORE clinical trials and all newly diagnosed lymphoma patients seen at the UI Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center (HCCC) and the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) and enrolled into the Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). The specific aims of the Core are: Aim 1) To provide accurate classification of all lymphomas (including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma) from patients enrolled onto SPORE clinical trials and the MER; Aim 2) To collect process bank and distribute biologic specimens from Iowa and Mayo lymphoma patients for translational research; Aim 3) To track all biospecimens and ensure linkage to clinical outcome and related data; and Aim 4) To provide expertise collaborative support and service for full Projects and Career Enhancement/Developmental Research Awardee research. Specimens are collected and processed under rigorous quality control and distributed to researchers or banked for future SPORE projects. Activities are tracked using a sophisticated database that merges activities at Iowa and Mayo and allows integration with clinical and other data collected in research projects. The Core provides specialized expertise in working with lymphoma biospecimens and is closely aligned with institutional research cores and shared resources but does not duplicate them. The Core has been highly productive in the last funding cycle and since its inception in 2002. To date the Core has supported the pathology review and specimen collection from patients on all SPORE clinical trials; 7065 patients enrolled into the MER and 1237 patients from those outside of the MER eligibility criteria (e.g. relapsed or transformed cases). The entire collection consists of 7958 germline DNA and 5733 serum samples; assembled tissue microarrays in 1790 patients; and banked frozen cells on 1284 patients. New in this funding period we developed a process to collect stool for gut microbiome analysis and have collected samples from 153 patients and 47 matched household controls. Also new to the Core is time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) which allows simultaneous evaluation of >35 proteins on a single-cell level. In planning the next grant cycle we have worked with all 4 new Projects to ensure that we can meet their biospecimen needs. In addition the Core will work with young investigators in the Career Enhancement Program on the research design of their proposals so that the appropriate samples can be provided. Lastly we will provide biospecimens expertise and biobank resources for innovative Developmental Research Proposals. These goals will be met by judicious use of our current Biobank and continued accrual of new patient samples to the bank (MER) and facilitating the collection of trial related samples for Project work.

"No NIH Category available","ABSTRACT: Overall. The University of Iowa/Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE (SPORE) is a dynamicproductive translational cancer research program based at two comprehensive cancer centers that was firstfunded in 2002 and competitively renewed in 2007 and 2012. At the center of the ongoing success of theSPORE is the collaborative interaction between investigators at Iowa and Mayo as well as SPORE basiclaboratory clinical and population science investigators focused on lymphoma. The overall goal of the SPOREis to support innovative interactive rigorous translational lymphoma research that leverages the expertise oflaboratory clinical and population science expertise at both institutions. Over the last funding period theSPORE has been highly productive as demonstrated by identification of new tumor markers and prognosticindices that are being used clinically; scientific findings that led to innovative clinical trials both within andoutside the SPORE; multiple publications with many authored by investigators from both institutions; and briskaccrual to translational clinical trials. The SPORE was involved in multiple productive vertical and horizontalcollaborations with other national and international academic institutions and organizations. For example theUI/MC Molecular Epidemiology Resource based in the SPORE is a vital resource for both SPORE researchand research projects supported by other grants. It served as the foundation for the funding of the LymphomaEpidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) Cohort (U01 CA195568) that includes 6 additional institutions therebyenhancing the scope and diversity of research facilitated by the SPORE. The current proposal includes 4 majorresearch projects. While all of the projects are new they are based on research results obtained over the pastfunding period. Project 1 will investigate why the innate immune system (monocyte/macrophage) issuppressed in lymphoma and aims to overcome that suppression with a novel SIRP-Fc in a phase I trial.Project 2 focuses on enhancing the clinical T-cell response by modifying the lymphoma microenvironment toaugment antigen release presentation of antigen and T cell activation and combining it with anti-PD1 therapyof NHL. Project 3 is investigating the dysregulated signaling pathways (TRAF3 and GSK3) that regulateglucose hypermetabolism in aggressive lymphoma. They will test a novel GSK3 inhibitor in a phase I trial.Project 4 is a Population Science project will test a combination of germline (host) and somatic (tumor)genomic biomarkers tumor gene expression and clinical factors to predict at diagnosis whichimmunochemotherapy-treated FL patients will have an early clinical failure. The SPORE also includesDevelopmental Research and Career Enhancement Programs to pursue novel translational concepts inlymphoma research and new investigators through the programs respectively. Finally the SPORE will enhancethe infrastructure that supports translational lymphoma research at both institutions through shared coreresources in Administration Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Biospecimens and Clinical Research.","Address;Advocate;Agonist;Antigen Presentation;Antigens;Area;Basic Science;Bioinformatics;Biology;Biometry;Cancer Research Project;Caring;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Sciences;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Complement;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Dendritic Cells;Development;Diagnosis;Epidemiology;Failure;Follicular Lymphoma;Foundations;Functional disorder;Funding;Gene Expression;Genetic;Genomics;Glucose;Goals;Grant;Human;Immune;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Immuno-Chemotherapy;Immunotherapy;Infrastructure;Injections;Innate Immune System;Institution;Integration Host Factors;International;Iowa;Laboratories;Lymphoma;Lymphoma cell;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolism;Modification;Molecular Epidemiology;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Outcome;Patients;Peer Review;Peer Review Grants;Phagocytes;Population;Population Sciences;Productivity;Prognosis;Publications;Relapse;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resources;Risk;Science;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;T cell response;T-Cell Activation;TNF receptor-associated factor 3;Testing;Translating;Translational Research;Tumor Biology;Tumor Markers;Universities;Work;anti-PD-1;anti-PD1 therapy;base;career;clinical epidemiology;cohort;cytokine;exhaustion;genomic biomarker;genomic predictors;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;macrophage;monocyte;novel;outcome prediction;phase I trial;prognostic index;programs;sound;success;survivorship;translational cancer research;translational clinical trial;trial design;tumor;tumor metabolism;tumor microenvironment","Lymphoma Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Human Cancer","PROJECT NARRATIVE: OverallThe University of Iowa / Mayo Clinic Lymphoma SPORE is a highly productive research program based at twoNCI designated comprehensive cancer centers.

For the first time in the context of psychiatric illness we recentlyexplored the utility of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) strategy called T1 relaxation in the rotating frame(T1) which is highly sensitive to brain pH. We tested patients with BD in the euthymic state and foundprominent T1 differences compared to matched controls. More recently we also imaged participants with BDin depressed and manic states. These studies suggest that the brain area with the most prominent T1changes in bipolar disorder is the cerebellum a structure has been previously suggested to contribute to BDbut has received relatively little attention compared to forebrain structures. Neuroanatomical models of BDhave largely overlooked the cerebellum despite compelling evidence that the cerebellum is strongly connectedto brain regions involved in the emotional control network that has been put forth as a model of the disorder.We hypothesize that cerebellar activity plays a critical role in regulating mood in BD which will be tested in thisproposal using a cross-sectional design and recruiting BD subjects across the mood spectrum as well asmatched controls. Participants will undergo psychiatric symptom assessment and brain imaging. Psychiatricsymptom assessments will include the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and YoungMania Rating Scale (YMRS). Brain imaging will include quantitative whole-brain T1 mapping 31P- and 1H-MRS of the cerebellar vermis as well as diffusion imaging (DWI) and resting state fMRI. Medications will beassessed and used as covariates in analyses. This data will be used to assess the following aims: Aim 1) Doescerebellar activity play a significant role in mood regulation in BD? We hypothesize that the cerebellum plays asignificant role in maintaining a euthymic mood state (i.e. plays a compensatory role). We reason that ifcerebellar activity normalizes mood then its activity should be greatest when BD participants are euthymic anddecrease with increasing mood symptom severity. Alternatively if cerebellar activity drives abnormal moodsthen it is likely to be greatest in patients who are manic or depressed. Aim 2) Does connectivity of thecerebellar vermis with the emotional control network differ with mood symptoms in BD? We hypothesize thatfunctional connectivity between the vermis and nodes of the emotional control network will vary with moodstate with increased connectivity in the euthymic state and decreased connectivity during exaggerated moodstates (depression/mania). We also expect that BD participants in the euthymic state will exhibit increasedconnectivity relative to healthy controls. These results would provide further evidence that the cerebellum isplaying a compensatory role to maintain mood. In addition this would support a refined model of the neuralcircuits underlying the pathophysiology of BD.","Address;Affect;Area;Attention;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Cerebellar vermis structure;Cerebellum;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Depressed mood;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diffusion;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease model;Emotional;Exhibits;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Image;Literature;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Manic;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Metabolism;Modeling;Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale;Moods;Participant;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Population;Process;Prosencephalon;Protons;Relaxation;Rest;Role;Schizophrenia;Severities;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Structure;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;bipolar spectrum;brain metabolism;design;evidence base;imaging modality;insight;mood regulation;mood symptom;multimodality;network models;neural circuit;neural model;psychiatric symptom;recruit","Cerebellar metabolism neural circuits and symptoms in bipolar disorder","NARRATIVEWe are proposing to study a major psychiatric illness bipolar disorder.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Invasive Aspergillosis caused by azole resistant A. fumigatus has a mortality rate nearing an alarming 90% making this a clinical problem of acute significance. Early work on A. fumigatus suggested that azole resistance was rare and that the genetic basis of resistance was most often due to changes in a gene (cyp51A) encoding the azole target protein lanosterol -14 demethylase. Recent work from our groups has provided evidence that expression of an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-encoding gene called abcG1 (aka cdr1B) is linked to azole resistance in the absence of any changes at the cyp51A locus. Here we propose to investigate a key transcriptional regulator called AtrR that coordinately regulates expression of both cyp51A and abcG1. AtrR is a Zn2Cys6 zinc cluster-containing factor that resembles other fungal transcriptional regulators of drug resistance. We have found that loss of the atrR gene eliminated the high-level azole resistance seen in clinical isolates. Additional preliminary data generated by use of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA-seq have shed light on direct and indirect targets of AtrR regulation. We have generated two different hyperactive alleles of atrR that drive elevated expression of abcG1 and enhanced azole resistance. These data suggest that AtrR is normally subject to negative regulation that can be overcome in different manners. We suggest that defects in this negative regulatory system may influence clinically significant azole resistance owing to increased expression of AtrR-dependent target genes (like abcG1 and cyp51A). The goal of this proposal is to employ a combined biochemical molecular biological and genetic dissection of the regulation of AtrR in order to understand how this factor acts to induce azole resistance. Our initial goal is to carry out a structure/function analysis of AtrR and identify protein domains that are important for regulation of this factor. We will also use direct biochemical purification to identify factors that associate with AtrR and influence its function. Second we will use forward genetic screening involving impala transposon mutagenesis to identify AtrR regulatory factors in an unbiased functional manner. Finally we will examine the role of an AtrR target gene that encodes a transcription factor called RfeC. Preliminary data indicate that RfeC is important in AbcG1 expression and azole resistance. We will examine the epistatic relationship between our atrR alleles and rfeC (as well as other azole resistance-affecting transcription factors) to establish the regulatory hierarchy controlling azole resistance. These experiments will illuminate the physiological network controlling AtrR that directly links ergosterol biosynthesis to ABC transporter gene expression and provide important new information about azole resistance in this fungal pathogen.","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters;Acute;Affect;Agriculture;Alleles;Anabolism;Antibiotics;Antibodies;Antifungal Agents;Antimicrobial Resistance;Appearance;Aspergillosis;Aspergillus fumigatus;Azole resistance;Azoles;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biological;Bypass;Candidate Disease Gene;Carrier Proteins;ChIP-seq;Clinic;Clinical;Coupled;Data;Defect;Development;Dissection;Drug resistance;Enzymes;Ergosterol;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Epistasis;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Gold;High-Throughput DNA Sequencing;Histidine;Human;Hyperactivity;Infection;Lanosterol;Leucine;Light;Link;Mammalian Cell;Medicine;Molds;Molecular;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Organism;Participant;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiology;Predisposition;Proteins;Regulation;Resistance;Resistance development;Role;Sterol Biosynthesis Pathway;Sterols;Structure;System;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Transcriptional Activation;Virulence;Work;Zinc Cluster;antimicrobial drug;chemotherapy;chromatin immunoprecipitation;clinically significant;experimental study;fungus;insight;mortality;mutant;pathogenic fungus;pathogenic microbe;promoter;resistance allele;resistant Aspergillus;resistant strain;spelling;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing","Analysis of transcription factors determining azole resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus","Aspergillus fumigatus is the major human filamentous fungal pathogen with a mortality reaching 90% during infections caused by drug resistant forms of this fungus.

"Chronic Pain; Clinical Research; Interstitial Cystitis; Pain Research; Urologic Diseases; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTUrologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (UCPPS) encompasses two highly prevalent chronic urologic paindisorders interstitial cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in men and women and chronicprostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men. Like many chronic pain disorders UCPPS ispoorly understood and characterized and treatment is mostly empirical and unsatisfactory. TheMultidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network was established bythe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to study the etiology andtreated natural history of UCPPS to inform better treatments and management of symptoms through improveddesigns of clinical trials and to identify clinical factors and research measurements to define clinically relevantsub-groups of these patients.The MAPP Research Network is currently completing enrollment of participants into the Trans-MAPP SymptomPatterns Study (SPS) which involves integrated phenotyping of UCPPS participants at baseline and during a36-month longitudinal observational period. The SPS includes measures to refine UCPPS subgroupingidentify symptom trends and discover associated risk factors and biological correlates to progression profiles.Integrated within the central protocol are studies to correlate clinical and biological profiles with response toselected UCPPS therapies (the Analysis of Therapies during Longitudinal Assessment of Symptoms [ATLAS]study). The current funding period ends in June 2019. We propose a three-year funding extensionthrough June 2022. During the proposed three-year extension we aim to accomplish the following:SPECIFIC AIM 1: To Obtain an Additional 12 Months of Follow-up in the MAPP-II SPS. The MAPP-II SPSwas designed to follow UCPPS participants for up to three years. By extending the timeframe for longitudinalfollow-up from July 2019 to July 2020 the number of UCPPS participants followed for three years in the SPSwill almost double (from 198 to 384). This additional data will substantially increase the ability of MAPPinvestigators to examine patterns and predictors of UCPPS symptoms over time. SPECIFIC AIM 2: ToObserve Additional ATLAS Events in the MAPP-II SPS. A major focus of the MAPP-II SPS is to correlateindividual participant phenotypes with UCPPS treatment response. To accomplish this SPS participantscomplete a phenotyping assessment before and after starting new UCPPS treatments (ATLAS study). Theadditional year of follow-up will provide time for new treatment `events' to occur which can be included in thisimportant analysis. SPECIFIC AIM 3: To Conduct Analyses of MAPP-II Data. The current funding periodprovides inadequate time for MAPP investigators to analyze the data collected as part of the SPS. Thereforethe final two years of the proposed three-year MAPP-II extension will be devoted exclusively to data analysisand manuscript preparation.","Biological;Chronic;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome;Chronic Prostatitis;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials Design;Data;Data Analyses;Enrollment;Epidemiology;Etiology;Event;Fibromyalgia;Funding;Goals;Individual;Interstitial Cystitis;Iowa;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Manuscripts;Measurement;Measures;Michigan;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Natural History;Pain;Pain Disorder;Participant;Pattern;Persons;Phase;Phenotype;Physiological;Preparation;Protocols documentation;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Site;Symptoms;System;Time;Universities;Urology;Washington;Woman;chronic painful condition;chronic pelvic pain;clinically relevant;design;epidemiologic data;follow-up;improved;insight;interdisciplinary approach;men;participant enrollment;patient subsets;recruit;response;symptom management;treatment response;trend;urologic;urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome","Urology Chronic Pelvic Pain Longitudinal Symptom Patterns Study","PROJECT NARRATIVEIn this application the MAPP Research Network investigators propose a 3-year extension of MAPP Phase II.This will provide an additional 12 months of follow-up for the MAPP Symptom Patterns Study (SPS).

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary This proposal outlines an integrated strategy to gain insights into 3 related processesthat determine the levels of integral membrane cell surface. Many cellular activities areexquisitely dependent on the level and repertoire of a variety proteins at the plasma membranewhich reflects a balance of trafficking pathways that control their internalization into endosomestheir transit from endosomes back to the plasma membrane along recycling routes and theirpackaging into endosomal intraluminal vesicles prior to delivery and degradation in lysosomes. One of the main determinants for sending membrane proteins for lysosomal degradationis their covalent attachment to ubiquitin that is subsequently recognized by a series of ubiquitin-sorting receptors. Exactly how ubiquitinated proteins are physically clustered on endosomalmembranes prior to incorporation into intraluminal vesicles has been unclear. However wehave discovered a family of small 4-pass membrane proteins that establish endosomalsubdomains that ubiquitinated proteins segregate into. Here we will study the properties ofthese proteins the formation of the subdomains and the types of cargo and sorting events thatsuch subdomains control. Ubiquitin has also been shown to be a signal for internalization however the exactsorting receptor(s) that mediate its recognition by many multi-component internalizationapparatus. We have discovered that the one family of cargo adaptors for clathrin coated vesicleinternalization binds ubiquitin with relatively high affinity. We will now determine whether thisfamily perhaps in combination with other Ub-binding proteins serves as a critical component forubiquitin-dependent internalization of cell surface proteins. One of the critical sorting decisions between degrading a protein or allowing it to remainactive takes place in early endosomes where proteins are either packaged into tubulo-vesicularcarriers along a recycling route to the plasma membrane or packaged into intraluminal vesiclesfor subsequent delivery and degradation in lysosomes. We recently completed a genetic screenthat identified a plethora of new protein machinery required for recycling from early endosomes.This process is under broad metabolic control via the Rag/Gtr GTPases through a process thatis independent of TORC1. Here will pursue these observations with biochemical and geneticexperiments to connect this metabolic regulation with the trafficking machinery that effectsprotein movement through the recycling system.","Address;Affinity;Back;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biochemical Genetics;Bypass;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell membrane;Cell physiology;Cell surface;Clathrin;Clathrin Adaptors;Clathrin-Coated Vesicles;Complex;Crystallization;Degradation Pathway;Early Endosome;Endocytosis;Endosomes;Equilibrium;Event;Family;Funding;Genetic Screening;Goals;Golgi Apparatus;Growth Factor Receptors;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Integral Membrane Protein;Ion Channel;Knock-out;Lumen of the Lysosome;Lysosomes;Mammalian Cell;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Metabolic;Metabolic Control;Metabolism;Molecular;Movement;Mutagenesis;Nutrient;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Play;Process;Property;Proteins;Recycling;Regulation;Reporter;Role;Route;Series;Set protein;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;Sorting - Cell Movement;Structure;Surface;System;Testing;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Vesicle;Work;Yeasts;analog;experimental study;insight;lysosomal proteins;novel;receptor;trafficking","Ubiquitin-dependent sorting in endosomes and the TGN","Project NarrativeMost cellular functions rely on the proper activity of integral membrane proteins at the cellsurface.

"Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis; Diabetes; Dietary Supplements; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease; Nutrition","PROJECT SUMMARYDuring type 2 diabetes (T2D) loss of insulin sensitivity strongly associated with hepatic lipid accumulation increases gluconeogenesis underlying chronic hyperglycemia. Furthermore increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) during T2D is thought to drive insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus identifying mechanisms directly modulating both hepatic DNL and gluconeogenesis could be uniquely valuable for understanding T2D pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunity. Cytosolic citrate is believed to be a master regulator of hepatic metabolism by reciprocally regulating glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and by supplying substrate and reducing power for DNL. Citrate is produced in the mitochondria and requires a specific transporter the mitochondrial citrate carrier (CiC) to reach the cytosol. Thus the CiC is predicted to occupy a central metabolic node linking hepatic mitochondrial metabolism DNL glucose and reductive drive. Yet surprisingly the role of the CiC modulating hepatic DNL and gluconeogenesis in normal and T2D states remains sparsely addressed in vivo. The overall goal of this application is to understand how the hepatic CiC contributes to fundamental metabolism and T2D pathophysiology. This will be addressed by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine how hepatic CiC function regulates hepatic DNL in T2D states; and 2) Determine how hepatic CiC function contributes to hyperglycemia in T2D states. Experiments in aim 1 will test the hypothesis that disrupting hepatic CiC activity in vivo during T2D states decreases DNL by decreasing supply of citrate as a carbon source and decreasing NAPDH available for fatty chain elongation. Experiments in aim 2 will test the hypothesis that disrupting hepatic CiC activity in vivo during T2D states decreases hyperglycemia by attenuating liver insulin resistance shifting hepatic glucose metabolism towards glycolysis away from gluconeogenesis and decreasing mouse correlates of NAFLD progression. Overall the proposed investigation will test the fundamental regulatory role of the CiC in vivo and provide novel mechanistic information on how the single metabolic step of mitochondrial citrate export contributes to the core T2D features of increased hepatic DNL and gluconeogenesis. This research is significant because successful completion will uniquely advance fundamental understanding of T2D pathophysiology. This research is innovative because it will utilize novel in vivo CiC disruption and metabolomic tracing models to test the role of the CiC role linking mitochondrial metabolism DNL and gluconeogenesis in T2D.","Acetates;Address;Attenuated;Automobile Driving;Carbon;Chronic;Citrate (si)-Synthase;Citrates;Cytosol;Data;Diet;Disease Progression;Enzymes;Fatty Liver;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Generations;Gluconeogenesis;Glucose;Glucose Intolerance;Glycolysis;Goals;Health;Hepatic;Hyperglycemia;Insulin Resistance;Investigation;Knock-out;Knowledge;Link;Lipids;Liver;Liver Mitochondria;Macronutrients Nutrition;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mission;Mitochondria;Modeling;Mus;NADP;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Pharmacology;Public Health;Reaction;Regulation;Research;Role;Somatotype;Source;Sucrose;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;citrate carrier;experimental study;feeding;glucose metabolism;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;innovation;insulin sensitivity;lipid biosynthesis;liver metabolism;metabolomics;mitochondrial metabolism;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease;novel","Regulation of Hepatic Macronutrient Metabolism by Mitochondrial Citrate Transport","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research addresses the major public health issue of fatty liver and hyperglycemia during type2 diabetes.

"Nutrition; Obesity","This project seeks to understand the role of the integrated stress response (ISR) in brown adipose tissue(BAT) for systemic metabolic homeostasis. The studies proposed herein have the potential of uncovering anovel pathway to amplify thermogenic activation of BAT and to induce the BAT secretome that might beindependent of 3-adrenergic activation and might be leveraged to combat obesity and its comorbidities.BAT plays a critical role in maintaining core body temperature through adaptive thermogenesis and can affectadiposity by regulating key pathways in energy homeostasis. Accordingly strategies designed to activateBAT as well as to promote browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) could be attractive for combating obesityand associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies demonstratedthat the ISR is activated in BAT in response to acute cold exposure which correlated with induction of theunfolded protein response (UPR) and secretion of batokines known to exert protective effects on systemicmetabolism such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15).We have generated preliminary data confirming these findings. In addition we observed similar inductions ofthe UPR and the ISR in mice with BAT-specific deletion of the mitochondrial protein Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1).Interestingly these mice had improved metabolic fitness and were better able to adapt to cold. Althoughstudies suggest that BAT-derived FGF21 plays a negligible role on the systemic metabolic adaptations to coldexposure the contribution of BAT-derived GDF15 on adaptive thermogenesis and on systemic metabolichomeostasis is incompletely understood. Therefore we hypothesized that cold exposure and mitochondrialstress lead to the induction of the ISR and its master regulator activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in BATvia the activation of the UPR kinase protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) toinduce BAT secretion of GDF15 thereby improving systemic metabolic homeostasis. Extensive examinationof the ISR in BAT will shed light on BAT physiology and adaptation to stress and may uncover noveltherapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity diabetes and CVD. Aim 1 of this proposal will investigate therequirement of PERK for ISR and ATF4 activation in BAT in response to cold and mitochondrial stress. Aim2 will determine whether ATF4 is required and sufficient for GDF15 induction and for proper adaptivethermogenesis. Aim 3 will determine whether GDF15 is required to mediate the systemic metabolicadaptations following cold exposure and mitochondrial stress in BAT and whether it mediates its effectsthrough central activation of its receptor glial-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alpha-like (GFRAL).Generation of novel genetic mouse models will reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying ISR activationand the physiological roles of ATF4 and GDF15 in BAT which may inform novel therapeutic strategies tocombat obesity and its comorbidities.","Acute;Adipocytes;Adipose tissue;Adrenergic Agents;Affect;Body Temperature;Brown Fat;Cardiovascular Diseases;Chemicals;Chimeric Proteins;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Endocrine;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Energy Metabolism;Exhibits;GDF15 gene;Generations;Genetic;Homeostasis;In Vitro;Injections;Knockout Mice;Lead;Light;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Proteins;Molecular;Mus;Nerve Growth Factor Receptors;OPA1 gene;Obesity;Obesity associated disease;Optic Atrophy;PERK kinase;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Protein Kinase;Proteins;Resistance;Respiration;Role;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Stress;Testing;Therapeutic;Thermogenesis;Thinness;Weight Gain;activating transcription factor 4;biological adaptation to stress;cardiovascular health;combat;comorbidity;design;diet-induced obesity;fibroblast growth factor 21;hindbrain;improved;in vivo;metabolic fitness;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;obesity treatment;overexpression;protective effect;protein activation;protein kinase R;receptor;response;tool;upstream kinase","The role of the integrated stress response in brown adipose tissue-mediated metabolic adaptations","Cold exposure and mitochondrial stress induce the integrated stress response (ISR) in brown adiposetissue (BAT) resulting in the activation of the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4).

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Cancer; Dementia; Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD); Hematology; Neurodegenerative; Rare Diseases","There is a fundamental gap in understanding how Granulin (GRN) regulates myeloid cell differentiation.Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem because until it is filled understanding of howGranulin contributes to the development of acute myeloid leukemia would be unknown and therefore themanipulation of the Granulin pathway to treat these hematopoietic malignances will remain unreachable. Thelong-term goal is to improve the prognosis of patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia by expanding theirtherapeutic options. The overall objective is to define in vivo the myeloid cell populations that require Granulinfor proper development as well as the molecular pathway activated by Granulin in myeloid cells. The centralhypothesis is that Granulin is essential for proper myeloid lineage differentiation of granulocytes neutrophils andmacrophages through the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family members.This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced by the applicant. The rationalefor the proposed research is that understanding the fundamental molecular mechanisms of hematopoieticregulation by Granulin has the potential to translate into better understanding of the pathogenesis of acutemyeloid leukemia blood malignancies with a low cure rate of 24%. Guided by strong preliminary data thishypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify in vivo the myeloid cell populations that requireGrna for proper development; and 2) Determine which STAT family members are activated through Granulin forproper myeloid differentiation. Under the first aim a published grna mutant which has been described by theapplicant to have decreased myeloid cell numbers will be used to identify in vivo the myeloid cell populationswhose development is affected by the absence of Grna both during embryonic and adult hematopoiesis.Powerful in vivo microscopy tools in the zebrafish embryo histological techniques and RNA-hybridization probesthat are already on hand will be used. Under the second aim quantitative PCR to pinpoint the STAT familymembers activated by Grna and injection of mRNA for each STAT candidate in grna mutant embryos will beperformed to rescue myeloid defects. An innovative approach is proposed by taking advantage of the zebrafishgenome duplication that resulted in two copies of the ancestral Granulin gene (grna and grnb) to understand inan unprecedented manner the hematopoietic function of Granulin due to the specialization of grna inhematopoietic processes. Since grna is specific to hematopoietic processes this avoids disruption of othertissues. In addition the power of the zebrafish for visualization of in vivo development of hematopoiesis isexploited. The proposed research is significant since it is expected to vertically advance understanding of howGranulin could be contributing to acute myeloid leukemia and how this protein could be manipulated to treatthese disorders.","Acute Myelocytic Leukemia;Adult;Affect;Biological Process;Biology;Blood;Cell Count;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Lineage;Cell Proliferation;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Embryo;Family member;Frontotemporal Dementia;GRN gene;Genes;Goals;Growth;Guide RNA;Hand;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification;Hematopoietic stem cells;Histological Techniques;Human;Human Cell Line;Inflammation;Injections;Knowledge;Lead;Lysosomes;Malignant Neoplasms;Messenger RNA;Microglia;Microscopy;Molecular;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Myelopoiesis;Myeloproliferative disease;National Cancer Institute;Nerve Degeneration;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Population;Process;Prognosis;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;RNA;Regulation;Research;Role;STAT protein;Signal Transduction;Survival Rate;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Transgenic Organisms;Translating;Vertebrates;Visualization;Zebrafish;base;genetic manipulation;granulin;granulin 3;granulin 4;granulocyte;improved;in vivo;innovation;macrophage;member;monocyte;mutant;myeloid cell development;neutrophil;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;segregation;tool;wound healing;zebrafish genome","In vivo assessment of granulin dependent myeloid cell formation","The proposed research is relevant to public health since understanding the previously unanticipated role ofGranulin (GRN) in normal myeloid cell development will ultimately help explain the pathogenesis of bloodmalignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia.

"Health Disparities; Minority Health","Project Summary/Abstract All cells experience force. These forces are sensed by cell surface adhesion receptors and trigger robustactin cytoskeletal rearrangements and growth of the associated adhesion complex to counter the applied forces.This process is known as cell stiffening or reinforcement. The actin re-arrangements necessary for stiffening areenergetically costly suggesting that mechanisms coupling force transduction and energy production exist.Previously our laboratory identified a mechanism for coupling force transmission and energy utilization. Wedemonstrated that in response to force AMPK is recruited and activated at the E-cadherin adhesion complexesthereby stimulating actomyosin contractility glucose uptake and ATP production. This increase in glucoseuptake and ATP provides the energy necessary to grow the adhesion complexes and reinforce the actincytoskeleton. Despite this advancement how mechanical force modulates glucose uptake and glucosemetabolism is not fully understood. This study aims to determine how glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) affectsforce-induced metabolic changes and cell stiffening. Here we suggest that GLUT1 is the force-sensitive glucosetransporter responsible for the glucose uptake necessary for the growth of adhesion complexes andreinforcement of the actin cytoskeleton. In further support of this notion we show that GLUT1 is recruited to thecell-cell junctions and forms a complex with E-cadherin in response to force. Furthermore we present evidencethat inhibition of GLUT1 blocks force-induced cell stiffening. A second goal of the proposed work in this study isto assess how glucose metabolism is coupled to E-cadherin mediated cytoskeleton rearrangements. Multipleglycolytic enzymes are bound to filamentous actin (F-actin) such as aldolase and phosphofructokinase-1.Previous studies have demonstrated that F-actin bound aldolase is released upon insulin stimulated actinremodeling.

The current proposal builds on the rich tradition of the UIowa as a leader in preclinical and clinical NINDS-sponsored stroke research. This infrastructure brings together basic cerebrovascular scientists with vascular neurologists and clinical trialists to conduct rigorous animal trials of ischemia-reperfusion. We will capitalize on our experience using both male/female animals co-morbidities (e.g. hyperlipidemia) combined with a rigorous methodology to minimize biases including randomization blinding intention-to -treat analyses and independent outcome adjudications. Our proposals immediate goal is to advance the field of synergistic neuroprotective interventions by allowing uric acid (UA) progress from comparative animal experiments into phase II trials conducted in a future StrokeNet-developed research MT platform. Specifically this proposal incorporates UA as one of the therapies to be tested through this preclinical assessment network. The free-radical (peroxynitrite) scavenger action of UA is crucial to minimize the brain reperfusion injury and lack of reflow that occurs after MT. UA has a strong record of efficacy in animals within STAIR/RIGOR guidelines as well as an excellent record of safety and preliminary efficacy in patients treated with MT. Intravenous infusions of UA will be compared against the other candidate molecules in SPAN through blinded randomized adaptive experiments using the animals models and co-morbidities deemed necessary by the SPAN coordinating center.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Hearing Loss; Human Genome; Neurosciences; Prevention","Project Summary Hearing loss affects 15-26% of the world's population. Amongst the elderly it ranks as the most commonneurological disability impacting ~50% of octogenarians. The majority of inherited late-onset deafness isautosomal dominant and non-syndromic. In this new porposal we will build on our experience and expertise inhuman genetics and gene therapy to improve genetic deafness for deafness by leveraging the power of single-cell RNA sequencing and to establish whether targeted allele suppression can prevent or potentially reversehearing loss in mature animal models of human deafness by using RNA interference (RNAi). To achieve these goals we propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Using single-cell isolation techniques we propose: o SA1A. To refine our knowledge of individual cell-specific transcription in the organ of Corti and improve comprehensive genetic testing for deafness by identifying and characterizing novel exons and isoforms of genes implicated in both non-syndromic and syndromic forms of hearing loss. o SA1B. To characterize the broader impact of single gene mutations on the transcriptome of individual cells in two murine models of human ADNSHL  the Kncq4+/- mouse which is a model of human DFNA2-related hearing loss and the Tmc1Bth/+ mouse (the Beethoven (Bth) mouse) which is a model of human DFNA36-related hearing loss. Specific Aim 2. Using RNAi we propose: o SA2A. To establish whether targeted allele suppression can prevent or potentially reverse hearing loss in mature animals. o SA2B. To develop a broadly applicable treatment strategy for all types of deafness caused by a single gene using a novel RNAi construct that suppresses both endogenous alleles with concomitant gene replacement by an exogenous wild-type allele engineered to resist RNAi-mediated silencing. o SA2C. To determine whether systemic neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to AAV impact the transduction efficiency of AAV-mediated cochlear gene therapy. The successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biology of hearing anddeafness enhance the clinical care of persons with hearing loss and potentially lay the foundation for clinicaltrials using RNAi as a treatment option for some types of hearing loss.","Affect;Alleles;Biology;C57BL/6 Mouse;Cell Separation;Cells;Clinical Trials;Cochlea;Elderly;Engineering;Exons;Foundations;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hearing;Human Genetics;Immunocompetent;Individual;Inherited;Knowledge;Length;Mediating;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Mus;Mutation;Neurologic;Octogenarian;Organ of Corti;Outcome;Passive Immunization;Pathway interactions;Persons;Play;Population;Protein Isoforms;RNA Interference;Role;Syndrome;Techniques;Testing;Transfection;adeno-associated viral vector;base;clinical care;deafness;disability;disability impact;experience;gene replacement;gene therapy;genetic deafness;genetic disorder diagnosis;genetic testing;genetic variant;hearing impairment;hearing loss treatment;hereditary hearing loss;human model;improved;mature animal;membranous labyrinth;mouse model;neutralizing antibody;novel;prevent;single-cell RNA sequencing;transcriptome;transduction efficiency;treatment strategy","Autosomal Dominant Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss - Its Genetic Diagnosis and Treatment","In Specific Aim 1 full-length single-cell RNA-seq on individual cells isolated from mousecochleae will be used to identify novel exons in genes implicated in non-syndromic hearing lossand to characterize the effect of single gene mutations on transcriptomes in two mouse models ofautosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL).

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Human Genome","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although reperfusion therapyimproves post-MI survival the rapid restoration of oxygenated blood flow to the heart elicits oxidative stress thatfurther damages tissue known as ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury exacerbating ones risk for developing heart failure(HF). Central to IR injury are mitochondria which play key roles in cardiomyocyte Ca2+ buffering and production ofenergy and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Upon IR mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and ROS trigger mitochondrialpermeability transition (mPT) pore opening which promotes cell death. While many studies highlight the critical roleof mPT in IR injury and cardioprotection many molecular pathways leading to altered mitochondrial Ca2+ and ROS(key upstream regulators of mPT) remain poorly defined. In recent work we discovered that a heart- and muscle-enriched long non-coding RNA actually does encode for a highly-conserved single-pass transmembrane micro-protein that localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane; we named this protein Mitoregulin (Mtln). In gain- andloss-of-function studies we found that Mtln supercharges mitochondria by increasing their 1) respiratory super-complex levels 2) respiratory efficiencies and 3) Ca2+ retention capacities while reducing ROS. In this grant wepropose Aims to address two central hypotheses: 1) that Mtln protects against cardiac IR injury by delaying Ca2+- andROS-triggered mPT and 2) that human genetic variation linked to Mtln expression associate with HF patientoutcomes. Our overarching goal is to translationally link Mtln with cardiac IR injury and HF outcomes to justify a needfor future studies to continue defining Mtlns precise modes of action. In Aim 1 we will define the physiologic andmolecular functions of Mtln in cardiomyocytes by evaluating the acute effects of modulating Mtln expression onmitochondrial respiration Ca2+ and ROS as well as supercomplex levels in cultured rodent cardiomyocytes. We willalso define Mtln domains and protein interactions necessary for its function. In Aim 2 we will elucidate a role for Mtlnin cell and rodent models of IR injury and HF through gain- and loss-of-function studies to evaluate the impact of Mtlnmodulation on cardiomyocyte death induced by simulated IR as well as on responses to cardiac IR injury and ensuingHF in mice. In Aim 3 we will work to establish links among genetic variants cardiac Mtln expression and HF patientoutcomes focusing on the biological and genetic relevance of a 36-bp 3UTR deletion variant (Mtln-3UTRdel) that ispresent in 12% of the general population and is known to be linked to decreased Mtln mRNA levels in heart tissues.We will identify RNA-binding proteins that control Mtln expression and assess the impact of the 3UTRdel variant onthis regulation and on Mtln protein levels in human hearts. We will also test available DNA samples linked to clinicaldata in patient cohorts to assess the association of Mtln-3UTRdel genotypes with HF incidence and outcomes (e.g.mortality and arrhythmic events). These multi-disciplinary studies have significant potential to 1) transform ourknowledge of basic mitochondrial biology 2) determine if Mtln represents a viable target for HF therapy and 3) revealnew genetic markers that could translate towards improved identification and treatment of high-risk HF patients.","3&apos; Untranslated Regions;Acute;Address;Affect;American;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biology;Blood flow;Buffers;Calcium;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cell Death;Cell model;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical Data;Complex;DNA;Development;Event;Follow-Up Studies;Future;Gene Proteins;General Population;Genetic;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Markers;Genetic Variation;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Grant;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Heart failure;Hela Cells;Human;Human Genetics;Hypoxia;In Vitro;Incidence;Inner mitochondrial membrane;Ischemia;Knowledge;Link;Membrane;Membrane Potentials;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Mitochondria;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Myocardial Ischemia;Myocardium;Names;Necrosis;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Permeability;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Predisposing Factor;Prevalence;Production;Proteins;Publishing;RNA;RNA-Binding Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Reperfusion Injury;Reperfusion Therapy;Respiration;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent;Rodent Model;Role;Sampling;Testing;Tissues;Translating;Treatment Failure;Untranslated RNA;Up-Regulation;Variant;Woman;Work;adverse outcome;biological adaptation to stress;cardioprotection;cohort;cost;genetic variant;high risk;improved;ischemic cardiomyopathy;knock-down;loss of function;men;mitochondrial membrane;mitochondrial permeability transition pore;mortality;multidisciplinary;novel therapeutics;overexpression;prevent;protein protein interaction;public health relevance;respiratory;response;restoration","The physiologic and genomic relevance of mitoregulin in ischemic heart failure","PROJECT NARRATIVEPublic Health Relevance: Myocardial infarction and ischemic heart failure are leading causes of morbidity andmortality for both men and women worldwide.

"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYMosquito arbovirus transmission causes hundreds of millions of human infections every with significant diseasemorbidity and mortality outcomes. However despite the requirements of the mosquito host for virus replicationand transmission our understanding of these mechanisms is poorly understood. This includes the role ofmosquito immune cells or hemocytes which may have both positive and negative influences on virus replication.Building on our expertise in hemocyte biology and host-pathogen interactions we now look to examine the roleof mosquito hemocytes on dengue (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Using a chemical genetics approachwe provide preliminary data demonstrating our ability to deplete phagocytic immune cell populations in Aedesaegypti which serve as the basis of our proposed experiments. Therefore the studies in this proposal willexamine the contributions of phagocytic immune cells on DENV and ZIKV infections and explore themechanisms by which these cells may mediate systemic RNAi responses in the mosquito host (Aim 1). Inaddition we will also explore potential roles of hemocytes as a secondary site of virus amplification that mayincrease viral titers and aid dissemination to increase the likelihood of transmission (Aim 2). Together we expectthat the results of this study will provide new information into the mechanisms of virus replication in the mosquitohost and define the integral role of hemocytes in mosquito vector competence to arbovirus infection.","Address;Aedes;Antiviral Agents;Arbovirus Infections;Arboviruses;Biology;Bite;Blood;Cells;Chemicals;Chikungunya fever;Culicidae;Data;Dengue;Dengue Fever;Dengue Virus;Disease;Drosophila genus;Economic Burden;Ensure;Environment;Goals;Hemocytes;Hemolymph;Human;Immune;Immune response;Infection;Innate Immune System;Interruption;Invaded;Laboratories;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Midgut;Morbidity - disease rate;Mosquito-borne infectious disease;Oral;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Phagocytes;Population;Positioning Attribute;Process;RNA Interference;Role;Salivary Glands;Sentinel;Site;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Tropism;Viral;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;Yellow Fever;ZIKA;ZIKV infection;Zika Virus;antiviral immunity;base;chemical genetics;combat;disease transmission;experience;experimental study;extracellular vesicles;genetic approach;health economics;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mortality;pathogen;response;reverse genetics;tissue tropism;transmission process;uptake;vector competence;vector mosquito;viral transmission;virus tropism;zika fever","The role of hemocytes in mosquito arbovirus infection","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe transmission of diseases like dengue and Zika is inherently tied to mosquitoes.

"Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Human Genome; Precision Medicine; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart failure is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The onset and clinical course of heartfailure is dictated by a complex interplay of environmental and hereditary factors. Population studies haveidentified a number of genetic links to heart disease however many of the variants are non-coding in natureand our ability to make sense of these associations has been hampered by our limited knowledge of the vastgenomic regulatory system that controls circulatory system gene expression. Recently microRNAs (miRs) haveemerged as key gene regulators in cardiac biology and disease. These small non-coding RNAs are loaded intoArgonaute (Ago) proteins to direct post-transcriptional gene suppression by base-pairing with target transcriptsand notably genetic variants disrupting this regulation have been linked to disease. To understand miR functionsand their interface with genetics and heart disease identifying their targets sites is paramount. Unfortunatelythere is a paucity of empirical miR targeting data in human cardiac tissues slowing the translational impact ofthe many investigations of disease-relevant miRs. To bolster these efforts our overarching goal is to define miRtargeting events and their biological-relevance in human hearts and to understand the clinical significance ofgenetic variants that alter cardiac miR functions. In this grant we will address limitations in identifying miR bindingsites important to the pathogenesis and genetic basis of heart disease by employing high-throughput techniquesto globally profile miR-target interactions in human cardiac tissues. The central hypothesis is two-fold: 1) thatmiR-target interactions are significantly rewired in failing human hearts and 2) that genetic variations (e.g. SNPs)perturbing these interactions will impact the clinical course of heart disease. In Aim 1 we will fill significantknowledge gaps regarding the mechanistic targets of cardiac miRs by generating transcriptome-wide maps ofmiR binding sites in normal non-failing and failing human heart tissues. The resulting data will point totranslationally-relevant SNPs that may modulate cardiomyopathy- and arrhythmia-related miR-target interactions(tested in Aim 2) having the potential to reveal new genetic modifiers that contribute to disease heterogeneity.Finally in Aim 3 we will determine if SNPs of this nature are linked to clinical outcomes (e.g. survival and fatalarrhythmias) in multiple heart failure patient cohorts discovering novel inherited risk factors that could impactpatient management. In addition we will push beyond basic genotype-phenotype links to gain insight into theunderlying mechanisms by defining genotype-specific changes in global myocardial gene expression signatures.Overall this work will 1) broadly advance our knowledge of cardiac miR functions 2) facilitate the translation ofgenetic studies of heart disease towards novel pathogenic mechanisms and improvements in personalizedmedicine and 3) support future efforts to extend the body map of miR targeting to vascular tissues that arerelated to other prevalent multifactorial cardio-metabolic diseases with complex genetic underpinnings.","Address;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Arrhythmia;Base Pairing;Binding;Binding Sites;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cardiac;Cardiometabolic Disease;Cardiomyopathies;Cardiovascular system;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Data;Complex;DNA;Data;Disease;Event;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Research;Genetic Transcription;Genetic Translation;Genetic Variation;Genetic study;Genomics;Genotype;Goals;Grant;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart failure;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Human;Inherited;Investigation;Investments;Knowledge;Left;Link;Maps;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Morbidity - disease rate;Myocardial;Nature;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phenotype;Population Study;Predisposing Factor;Prevalence;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Reporting;Research;Resources;Risk Factors;SNP genotyping;Sampling;Site;Structure;System;Techniques;Testing;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Transcript;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Ventricular;Woman;Work;bioinformatics pipeline;body map;cardiogenesis;clinically significant;cohort;cost;crosslink;crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing;disease heterogeneity;genetic risk factor;genetic variant;human data;human disease;human subject;human tissue;in vitro Assay;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;men;mortality;neuropsychiatry;novel;novel therapeutics;personalized medicine;prevent;public health relevance;response;sudden cardiac death;transcriptome;transcriptomics;translational impact","The genomic interface of microRNA regulation and heart failure","PROJECT NARRATIVEPublic Health Relevance: Heart failure is a leading cause of death for both men and women worldwide.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Sleep Research","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every animal must distinguish sensations that arise from its own movements from those arising from stimuli in the external world (e.g. lifting your arm vs. having your arm lifted for you). This distinction between self- and other-produced movements requires precise self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is instantiated mechanistically by copies of motor commands-corollary discharges-that prepare the nervous system for the arrival of sensations triggered by self-produced movements. Corollary discharge signals can gate cancel or otherwise modify incoming sensory signals. We propose to investigate two novel aspects of corollary discharge: Its expression in early infancy and its modulation by sleep-wake state. One impetus for this proposal is the observation that in newborn rats sensory feedback from self-produced limb twitches during active (or REM) sleep triggers spindle bursts in sensorimotor cortex and increased Purkinje cell activity in cerebellar cortex. In contrast during wakefulness when vigorous self-produced limb movements typically occur cortical spindle bursts are surprisingly absent and Purkinje cells are largely silent. This paradoxical ""masking"" ofneural activity during wake suggests the novel hypothesis that corollary discharge mechanisms are regulated in a state- dependent fashion. Importantly the hundreds of thousands if not millions of twitches produced by infant rats each day during sleep trigger substantial brain activity that is ideally suited to promote activity-dependent development in the sensorimotor system.  Specific Aim 1 will characterize state-dependent neural activity in sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum across the first two postnatal weeks in rats a period of rapid change in those structures. Critically by comparing spontaneous and evoked neural activity during sleep and wake this Aim will establish two new models for exploring the neural mechanisms and developmental origins of corollary discharge. Specific Aim 2 will provide critical new data regarding sensorimotor processing in early infancy through systematic comparison of state-dependent activity in brainstem nuclei implicated in (a) the production of limb twitches (b) the reception of proprioceptive input from limbs and (c) the processing of corollary discharge. We will also test the novel hypothesis that the locus coeruleus a brainstem nucleus that is both wake-active and a primary source of norepinephrine to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum contributes to the state-dependent modulation of corollary discharge. Finally Specific Aim 3 will explore the developmental emergence of reciprocal and state-dependent modulation of sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum. Such reciprocal interactions are essential for mature sensorimotor integration throughout the brain. The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience emphasizes the need for more basic research to understand neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. This proposal meets that need by uniquely integrating several innovative conceptual and methodological approaches to provide new insights into the functional development of critical sensorimotor systems.","Adolescent;Adult;Animals;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Models;Brain;Brain Stem;Cell Nucleus;Cerebellar Cortex;Cerebellar Nuclei;Cerebellum;Cerebral cortex;Cerebrum;Child;Data;Development;Disease;Dreams;Electric Stimulation;Esthesia;Event;Eye;Foundations;Human;Individual;Infant;Infant Behavior;Interdisciplinary Study;Lateral;Lifting;Limb structure;Mammals;Maps;Masks;Mediating;Mental disorders;Methodology;Modeling;Monitor;Motor;Motor Cortex;Movement;Nervous system structure;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurosciences;Newborn Infant;Norepinephrine;Output;Pathologic;Play;Process;Production;Purkinje Cells;REM Sleep;Rattus;Red nucleus structure;Role;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Sleep;Source;Stimulus;Structure;Structure of nucleus cuneatus;System;Testing;Thalamic structure;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Vibrissae;Wakefulness;Work;arm;autism spectrum disorder;awake;base;cognitive development;experimental study;infancy;innovation;insight;limb movement;locus ceruleus structure;motor behavior;neurodevelopment;neuromechanism;noradrenergic;novel;postnatal;postnatal period;prenatal;public health relevance;pup;relating to nervous system;response;response to injury;self organization;sensorimotor system;sensory feedback;spinal reflex","State-dependent sensory processing across early development","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience emphasizes how basic interdisciplinary research into the development of the brain and its response to injury is criticalfor advancing our understanding of the causes of the high rates of mental illness among children and adolescents.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Neurosciences; Pancreatic Cancer; Rare Diseases","Project Summary / AbstractNeuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are incurable clinically challenging malignancies that are rising in incidence.Although tumors grow slowly they progress relentlessly and lack effective therapies once they becomemetastatic. Many patients with advanced NETs will die from their disease. Greater understanding ofmechanisms driving NET progression and metastasis is needed to inform new therapies and improve patientoutcomes.We discovered a RABL6A-PP2A pathway that promotes pancreatic NET (PNET) pathogenesis. RABL6A(RAB-like GTPase) is upregulated in patient PNETs and is required for PNET proliferation and survival.RABL6A acts through multiple mechanisms that are only partly defined including inhibition of tumorsuppressors (p27 RB1) and activation of oncogenic pathways (MYC AKT-mTOR). A common regulator of allthose factors is protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) a powerful tumor suppressor whose role in NETs has notbeen explored. We found that RABL6A activates AKT-mTOR signaling in PNETs by inhibiting PP2A. In turnRABL6A is down regulated by PP2A although the molecular mechanism by which these two proteins inhibiteach other's function is unknown. Excitingly specific `small molecule activators of PP2A' (called SMAPs)suppress PNET cell proliferation and survival in a RABL6A-dependent manner and abolish tumor growth invivo. These findings support a novel strategy for PNET therapy involving PP2A reactivation. However the roleof RABL6A and PP2A in NET progression is only partly understood and their importance in NET metastasis isnot known. This multi-PI study draws upon the collective knowledge of both PIs and their unique expertise /resources in NETs (Quelle) and PP2A (Narla) to test the central hypothesis that the RABL6A-PP2Apathway is a critical driver of NET progression and response to targeted therapies. Aim 1 will determinethe mechanisms of RABL6A-PP2A reciprocal regulation. Aim 2 will define the roles and interdependence ofRABL6A and PP2A in NET progression and metastasis. Aim 3 will establish the importance of the RABL6A-PP2A alterations in NET pathogenesis and the efficacy of pathway targeted combination therapies.This project will provide new insights into molecular events driving NET progression and metastasis whileestablishing the efficacy of promising NET therapeutics thus addressing a critical gap in NET research thatmay ultimately improve patient outcomes. Moreover this work builds upon an emerging strategy for anticancertherapy (i.e. pharmacological reactivation of PP2A) and may have broad cancer relevance beyond NETsgiven the importance of RABL6A overexpression and PP2A inactivation in other tumor types.","Address;Affect;Automobile Driving;Cell Cycle;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;Cell model;Clinical;Combined Modality Therapy;Data;Dependence;Development;Disease;Event;FRAP1 gene;Genetic;Growth;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Half-Life;Holoenzymes;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;Islet Cell Tumor;Knowledge;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Oncogenic;Oncoproteins;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase;Phosphorylation;Population;Progression-Free Survivals;Protein phosphatase;Proteins;Proteomics;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;RB1 gene;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Regulation;Research;Resources;Role;Signal Transduction;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Cell Migration;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Validation;Work;advanced disease;angiogenesis;anti-cancer;c-myc Genes;cancer therapy;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;experimental study;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mTOR Inhibitor;migration;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;overexpression;phosphoproteomics;response;small molecule;targeted treatment;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression","Role of RABL6A-PP2A in neuroendocrine tumors","Project NarrativeThe majority of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) ultimately die from metastatic disease due to thelack of effective therapies necessitating a better understanding of mechanisms promoting NET progressionand metastasis to guide the development of improved targeted treatments.

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease","PROJECT SUMMARYHeart failure measured at the subcellular level is the result of impaired cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction(E-C) coupling. One key structural component of EC coupling is the myocyte transverse (T)-tubule system. T-tubules play an essential role in coordinating membrane excitation with muscle contraction by facilitating thesynchronized release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Our group as well as those of others haveprovided strong evidence that failing myocytes from patients and animal models are characterized by adegenerated and disorganized T-tubule system resulting in impaired intracellular Ca2+ dynamics andmyofilament contraction. The long-term goal of our research is to discern and take advantage of thefundamental mechanisms underlying T-tubule remodeling processes in heart disease toward restoring T-tubuleintegrity and slowing if not reversing heart failure progression. We have identified Mitsugumin 53(MG53/TRIM72) as a potential T-tubule repair enzyme. We find MG53 known to be involved in injury-inducedmembrane vesicle trafficking and repair in striated muscle localizes to T-tubules and is upregulated in humanfailing hearts and animal models of chronic heart failure. Our preliminary data indicate MG53 possessesapparent divergent functions in the heart MG53 deletion of MG53 exacerbates T-tubule degeneration instressed hearts while exogenous MG53 overexpression promotes progressive and severe T-tubule disruption.Interestingly we have mapped overexpression effects to its little-studied E3-ligase domain. It is ourhypothesis therefore that the membrane repair versus E3-ubiquitin ligase activities of MG53 determinecardiomyocyte T-tubule integrity and E-C coupling function during health and in disease. We have recentlygenerated two novel knockin animals for separately examining endogenous MG53 E3-ligase and membranerepair functions during cardiac stress responses. We will test our hypothesis by first determining thephysiological (Aim 1) and molecular (Aim 2) actions of the MG53 E3-ubiquitin ligase as well as its membranerepair (Aim 3) domains in T-tubule structure and Ca2+ handling at baseline and in response to cardiac stress.We will attribute apparently discordant ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and membrane healing functions ofMG53 to overall T-tubule integrity E-C coupling and cardiac remodeling processes. Understanding themechanisms by which MG53 facilitates T-tubule remodeling versus repair will allow us design highly targetedand efficacious therapeutics for heart failure treatment.","Acute;Animal Model;Biology;C-terminal;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cell Membrane Structures;Cells;Chronic;Congestive Heart Failure;Coupling;Data;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Failure;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Hypertrophy;Heart failure;Human;IRS1 gene;Imaging Techniques;Impairment;In Situ;Injury;Knock-in;Knock-in Mouse;Maps;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Potentials;Microfilaments;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Muscle Cells;Muscle Contraction;Mutation;Myocardial Contraction;Myocardium;N-terminal;Outcome;PI3K/AKT;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Play;Process;Proteins;Proteolysis;Proteome;Regulation;Research;Rodent;Role;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Seminal;Signal Transduction;Stress;Striated Muscles;Structure;Surface;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Treatment Failure;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Up-Regulation;Vesicle;base;biological adaptation to stress;cardiogenesis;confocal imaging;design;healing;heart function;improved;insight;interdisciplinary approach;knockin animal;membrane excitation;mouse model;mutant;novel;overexpression;pressure;programs;repair enzyme;repair function;repaired;response;restoration;targeted treatment;trafficking;ubiquitin-protein ligase","Molecular Determinants of MG53 in Heart Structure and Function","PROJECT NARRATIVEDuring heart failure the integrity of T-tubules specialized cell membrane structures essential for normal heart functiondeteriorates making heart contraction less efficient.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Sleep Research","Project Summary. The demands of modern society career pressures and technological advances inpersonal electronics and communication have increased sleep deprivation and sleep disorders across agegroups. Sleep deprivation adversely impacts individual health with increased disease incidence and decreasedcognitive function resulting in increased medical care as well as occupational and traffic accidents. Thenegative impact of sleep deprivation on memory can be observed across species suggesting that the sleepdeprivation may alter highly conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms to impact memory. Thehippocampus is an excellent model to investigate the neural impacts of sleep deprivation as hippocampalactivity is necessary for spatial memory and this type of memory is particularly susceptible to sleep deprivation.Current evidence indicates that sleep loss impairs the formation and stability of memories at the cellular levelthrough changes in the synapses of individual neurons. However the specific basis of how sleep deprivationadversely affects memory and how the brain can be rendered resilient to these effects remains poorlyunderstood. It is critical to define the cellular molecular and network mechanisms through which sleepdeprivation impacts neural function given not only the rising incidence of sleep deprivation but also theaggravating impact of sleep loss on many neuropsychiatric neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Ourprevious research has identified decreased second messenger signaling suppression of protein synthesis andchanges in neuron dendritic structure as pathways through which sleep deprivation affects memory. Howeverit remains unknown if sleep deprivation separately impacts targets in each of these pathways or if the effects ofsleep deprivation are mediated through a central molecular node. The objective of this proposal is to identifythe molecular and neuronal mechanisms through which sleep loss impairs synaptic plasticity and memoryformation by focusing on the molecular cellular and network mechanisms through which resilience to sleepdeprivation can occur. In Specific Aim 1 we use a novel transgenic approach we developed to spatially andtemporally manipulate a second messenger signaling pathway. This will allow us to investigate the molecularmechanisms which underlie neuronal resilience to the detrimental effects of sleep loss. In Specific Aim 2 weinvestigate several types of hippocampal synaptic plasticity targeted by sleep deprivation at the neuronal levelto identify which is associated with resilience. In Specific Aim 3 we identify the network and circuit propertiesof neurons affected by sleep deprivation using in vivo recordings from large neuronal populations. The resultsfrom our comprehensive experimental approach at the behavioral biochemical molecular andelectrophysiological levels will provide significant insights into the molecular signature that promotes resilienceto the negative impact of sleep deprivation on memory. As such our work may potentially lead to thedevelopment of interventions to overcome the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation on cognition.","Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Attenuated;Behavioral;Biochemical;Brain;Caring;Cell Signaling Process;Cell physiology;Cognition;Cognitive deficits;Communication;Coupled;Cyclic AMP;Development;Disease;Drosophila garnet protein;Electrodes;Electronics;Electrophysiology (science);Future;Goals;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Impairment;Incidence;Individual;Lead;Link;Long-Term Potentiation;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Medical;Memory;Memory Disorders;Memory impairment;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Molecular Structure;Monitor;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurons;Neurophysiology - biologic function;Occupational Accidents;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Population;Process;Property;Protein Biosynthesis;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Quality of life;Rattus;Research;Role;Running;Schizophrenia;Second Messenger Systems;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Sleep;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep Disorders;Sleeplessness;Societies;Specificity;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Traffic accidents;Transgenic Organisms;United States;Vertebral column;Viral;Virus;Work;age group;autism spectrum disorder;base;behavioral study;career;cognitive function;density;excitatory neuron;experience;experimental study;improved;in vivo;insight;memory consolidation;memory recognition;nervous system disorder;neuronal circuitry;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;object recognition;octopamine receptor;pressure;prevent;relating to nervous system;resilience;spatial memory;synaptic function;therapy development","Molecular Cellular and Circuit Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Hippocampal Function","Project Narrative.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Pediatric Cardiomyopathy; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited disease characterized by fibro-fattyinfiltration of the heart life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death particularly in responseto sympathetic stress. ARVC is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death among young athletes with no priorsymptoms or diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Desmosome cell-adhesion gene mutations constitute themajority of familial ARVC cases but it remains largely unknown how catecholamine-sensitive ventriculartachycardia and cardiac remodeling processes are facilitated by desmosome dysfunction. Patient managementis therefore limited to improving quality of life by reducing arrhythmic symptoms or cardiac transplantation uponadvanced heart failure. To begin to uncover mechanisms inherent to ARVC we performed unbiased massspectrometry analysis of ventricular samples from patients with different desmosomal gene mutations. Ourpreliminary data demonstrate that integrin 1D is significantly downregulated in ARVC resulting in de-stabilization of RyR2 ryanodine receptor Ca2+ channels that localize to cardiac dyad junctions. Mechanisticallywe find that ERK1/2 activation in response to desmosome loss results in ubiquitin-dependent degradation ofintegrin 1D RyR2 Ser-2030 phosphorylation sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and arrhythmogenesis.Importantly hearts of our integrin 1D knockout mice exhibit ARVC-like disease with increased RyR2phosphorylation catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac fibrosis. We hypothesize thatcommunication between desmosome junctions and cardiac dyads is essential for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasisand that ERK1/2 activation-induced loss of integrin 1D impairs this desmosome-dyad crosstalk therebypromoting RyR2-dependent and catecholamine-sensitive arrhythmogenesis and fibrotic infiltration in ARVC. Wefurther hypothesize that interventions targeting this pathway may offer a promising approach for treating ARVC.To test our hypothesis we have generated three congenic knock-in mouse models using CRISPR-Cas9 thatcontain mutations equivalent to those we identified from human ARVC patients. In Aim 1 we will determine thepathogenicity of knock-in ARVC mutations in recapitulating cardiac remodeling catecholamine-inducedarrhythmogenesis and desmosome-dyad crosstalk in mutant ARVC mice. In Aims 2 and 3 we will test whethermutation-induced ARVC phenotypes can be effectively prevented through ERK1/2 (Aim 2) and RyR2 (Aim 3)inhibition. We expect our studies to show that life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure fromARVC can be therapeutically managed by modulating desmosome-dyad crosstalk and attenuating Ca2+ handlingdysfunction.","Action Potentials;Address;Affect;American;Arrhythmia;Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia;Attenuated;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques;Catecholamines;Cell Adhesion;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collagen;Communication;Coupling;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Data;Defect;Deposition;Desmosomes;Disease;Disease Progression;Emotional;Exercise;Exhibits;Fibronectins;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;Genes;Goals;Guidelines;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Transplantation;Heart failure;Hereditary Disease;Homeostasis;Human;Hyperactivity;Impairment;Induced Mutation;Infiltration;Infusion procedures;Inherited;Integrins;Intercellular Junctions;Intervention;Isoproterenol;Knock-in;Knock-in Mouse;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Life;Life Expectancy;Link;MAPK3 gene;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mechanical Stress;Mechanics;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Muscle Cells;Mutation;Myocardial dysfunction;Myocardium;Nature;Outcome;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Phosphorylation;Predisposition;Primary Myocardial Diseases;Probability;Process;Proteins;Quality of life;Right Ventricular Dysfunction;Role;RyR2;Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel;Sampling;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structure;Sympathectomy;Symptoms;Tachycardia;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Ubiquitin;Ventricular;Ventricular Arrhythmia;Ventricular Tachycardia;age related;base;carvedilol;congenic;coronary fibrosis;effective therapy;improved;insight;knock-down;mouse model;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;prevent;proteomic signature;response;sudden cardiac death;transcriptomics","ERK1/2-Integrin Signaling in Desmosome-Dyad Crosstalk","PROJECT NARRATIVEArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a hereditary and progressive heart disease thatcan cause cardiac dysfunction fatal ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death affecting as many as1:1000 Americans.

"Biotechnology","PROJECT SUMMARYEukaryotic cellular stress responses are highly conserved and precisely regulated. When these pathwaysmalfunction there are often grave physiological consequences in the form of diseases such as cancerneurodegenerative disease and autoimmune disorders. Ubiquitin-like modifications (UBLs) are rapid reversibleand can profoundly alter cell fate and function. Intriguingly the majority of UBLs are involved in the cellularresponse to stress in particular the response to infection ER-stress and autophagy. Ubiquitin-like proteins sharestructural conservation with ubiquitin and also covalently modify target proteins however UBLs have extremelydivergent functions which range from transcriptional repression to autophagy initiation. Unlike ubiquitin theconsequences of ISGylation or ATG12ylation on target protein fate and function are largely unknown. In thisproposal we aim to decode the post-translational landscape of the cell following eukaryotic stress responsesusing sophisticated proteomics strategies to address the fundamental question of how ISG15 and ATG12 alterthe function of their covalent cellular targets.For ISG15 my laboratorys recent work identified a novel role in the control of host metabolic processes and thisproposal addresses how ISGylation of mTOR and other key upstream regulators of the catabolic process ofautophagy tunes the metabolic and catabolic capacity of cells and animals.For ATG12 we have pioneered an in vivo genetic method coupled with cutting-edge proteomics to identifyendogenous substrates of the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 following induction of cellularstress pathways such as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization or endoplasmic reticulum stress.","Address;Animals;Autoimmune Diseases;Autophagocytosis;Biochemistry;Catabolic Process;Cells;Cellular Stress;Cellular Stress Response;Cellular biology;Coupled;Disease;FRAP1 gene;Genetic;ISG15 gene;Infection;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methods;Modification;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Outer Mitochondrial Membrane;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;Role;Stress;Structure;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitin Like Proteins;Work;biological adaptation to stress;cellular targeting;endoplasmic reticulum stress;gene repression;in vivo;interdisciplinary approach;novel;protein complex;response","Discovery of Novel Mechanisms of Action of Ubiquitin-Like Proteins in Cellular Stress Pathways","NARRATIVEUbiquitin-like modifications (UBLs) are rapid reversible and can profoundly alter cell fate and function.Intriguingly the majority of UBLs are involved in the cellular response to stress in particular the response toinfection ER-stress and autophagy.

"Aging; Cancer; Clinical Research; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Digestive Diseases; Health Services; Prevention; Women's Health","Project Summary/AbstractColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in bothmen and women in the U.S. with nearly 50000 deaths each year. Since CRC develops over a number ofyears from precursor lesions called polyps it is largely detectable and preventable in early stages. As thesepolyps become larger they like most CRCs tend to bleed which is the rationale for the use of fecal occultblood tests (FOBTs) to detect both polyps and cancers early while they are curable. However earlyscreening and detection is much less common than it could be with about 43% of eligible individualsunscreened. Fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are a type of FOBT that can be a sensitive specific and low-cost alternative to colonoscopy for CRC screening. Modeling studies have shown that for population screeninga strategy of annual FIT testing from age of 50 to 75 years results in an equal number of life-years gained ascompared with colonoscopy every 10 years. However about 90% of screening in the U.S. is done withcolonoscopy the most expensive and invasive screening test. FITs are far less costly and largely replacing theguaiac test in CRC screening programs internationally where only individuals with positive results are referredfor a colonoscopy. Studies done on FITs in other countries often used FITs not available in the U.S. or studiedhigh-risk populations; thus results are not applicable in the U.S. It is critical to determine the FIT(s) with thebest test characteristics in order to implement successful FIT-based screening programs in this country.It is estimated that 24 million more individuals will need to be screened by 2018 to reach the 80% by2018 goal set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. To address this knowledge gap we proposeto compare the test characteristics of three CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs using colonoscopyas the gold standard. The rationale for this proposed study is that for almost all of the FITs currently marketedin the U.S. there is no evidence of the accuracy claimed. Our aims are: Aim 1: To assess the diagnostic accuracy for advanced colorectal neoplasms of three of the most commonly used CLIA-waived FITs and two automated FITs using colonoscopy as the gold standard. Aim 2: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of two quantitative FITs using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Aim 3: To assess factors associated with false positive and false negative FIT results for each device.These findings will provide essential information about FITs with the best test characteristics for futureexpanded use of FIT critically important to achieving our long-term goal of reducing morbidity and mortalityfrom CRC. FITs are more acceptable to patients will allow higher screening rates and will reduce costs ascompared with a screening strategy based on colonoscopy as the primary initial screening method.","Address;Age;Amendment;CCL4 gene;Cancer Etiology;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinical;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Neoplasms;Country;Data;Developed Countries;Devices;Early Diagnosis;Fecal occult blood;Foundations;Future;Goals;Gold;Guaiac;Home;Individual;International;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lesion;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Manufacturer Name;Medical Care Costs;Methods;Modality;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Neoplasms;Optics;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physicians&apos; Offices;Polyps;Population;Privacy;ROC Curve;Reading;Risk;Safety;Sampling;Specific qualifier value;Study models;Test Result;Testing;United States;United States Food and Drug Administration;Woman;Work;adenoma;base;colorectal cancer screening;comparative effectiveness;cost;cost estimate;diagnostic accuracy;dietary;early screening;high risk population;men;mortality;population based;screening;screening guidelines;screening program","Comparative Effectiveness of Fecal Immunochemical Tests with Optical Colonoscopy","Project NarrativeColorectal cancer is a preventable and/or a treatable cancer but 43% of the United States population is not up-to-date with screening.

Fortherapeutic translation however both approaches encounter various barriers including safetyconcerns. Compared to use of exogenous cells/proteins strategies that promote tissueregeneration by leveraging endogenous cells/signals in situ are more intriguing. Nonethelesschanges in tissue associated with aging (iron accumulation and chronic inflammation) challengebone regeneration and repair particularly in older populations. Emerging evidence suggeststhat the hypoxia-induced factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway is a central driver of regenerationand angiogenesis. Findings also show sustained activation of HIF-1 by an iron chelator (e.g.Deferoxamine DFO) is a promising strategy to improve the capacity of regeneration in agedbones where HIF-1 is markedly inhibited by elevated iron levels. Preliminary work by the Sunlab has found that another small molecule phenamil shows strong anti-inflammatory ability inaddition to playing a powerful role in promoting bone formation by targeting BMP signaling. Alocally and sustained drug delivery system and a bio-mimicking scaffold are critical forsuccessful translational application of these promising small molecular drugs. The primary goalof this study is to develop an innovative translational tissue engineering strategy to improveaged large bone regeneration by rejuvenating endogenous signals and reparative cells. Ourcentral hypothesis is that novel bio-mimicking 3D nanofibrous (NF) scaffold-mediated dual-release of small molecules DFO and phenamil can improve critical-sized bone defect repair inaged mice through locally: (1) scavenging for detrimental aged-related factors i.e. excessiveiron and inflammatory cytokines; and (2) activating HIF1 and BMP signaling pathways therebypromoting production of endogenous angiogenic and osteogenic factors and recruitment ofreparative cells (e.g. MSCs endothelial cells) in situ for bone regeneration with a primary focuson non-load-bearing bone defects. In Aim 1 we will develop novel biomimetic 3D NF scaffoldsusing our innovative technique of thermally induced nanofiber self-agglomeration (TISA). In Aim2 we will develop the dual-release system of DFO and phenamil from a 3D NF scaffold tomodulate both angiogenesis and osteogenesis in aged cells in vitro. In Aim 3 we will investigatethe contribution of local and controlled release of DFO and phenamil from scaffolds for critical-sized cranial bone defect repair in aged mice. The success of this project will establish a novelstrategy for challenged bone repair by improving endogenous tissue regeneration.","3-Dimensional;Address;Adult;Aging;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Autologous;Autologous Transplantation;Biomimetics;Bone Diseases;Bone Matrix;Bone Morphogenetic Proteins;Bone Regeneration;Bone Tissue;Bone Transplantation;Cell Transplantation;Cells;Cephalic;Chitosan;Chronic;Cost of Illness;Defect;Deferoxamine;Drug Delivery Systems;Elasticity;Elderly;Electrospinning;Endothelial Cells;Engineering;Female;Fibrinogen;Goals;Gold;Growth Factor;HA coating;HIF1A gene;Healthcare;Hormones;Human;Hypoxia;Immobilization;In Situ;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Iron;Iron Chelating Agents;Irregular Bone;Knowledge;Mediating;Medical;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Modeling;Modernization;Molecular;Mus;Natural regeneration;Older Population;Osteogenesis;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Polymers;Population;Prevalence;Production;Proteins;Regenerative Medicine;Regenerative capacity;Research;Role;Safety;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Somatotropin;Stem cell transplant;Structure;System;Techniques;The Sun;Therapeutic;Tissue Engineering;Tissues;Translations;Transplantation;Work;age related;aged;aging population;angiogenesis;bone;bone aging;cell age;cell growth;chemical conjugate;chemical property;clinically relevant;combinatorial;controlled release;cost;cytokine;effectiveness evaluation;human stem cells;improved;innovation;local drug delivery;male;mechanical properties;nanofiber;nanomaterials;new therapeutic target;next generation;novel;novel strategies;osteoblast differentiation;osteogenic;phenylamil;recruit;repaired;restoration;scaffold;small molecule;stem;success;tissue regeneration","Rejuvenating aged bone regeneration by innovative nanomaterials-mediated drug delivery","PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE)Repair of large bone defects is a crucial medical challenge and tissue engineering (either usingstem/progenitor cells transplantation and/or growth factors e.g. BMPs) is a promisingalternative to autologous bone graft while a number of crucial barriers must be overcome for fulltherapeutic translation.

"Neurosciences","Project Summary/AbstractThe ability to localize sound sources and detect temporal features of sound is fundamental tohearing. Encoding this information within the first few auditory processing stations requiresreliable and precise synaptic transmission in response to rapid and large fluctuations of upwardsto the kilohertz range in action potential (AP) firing rates. However the number of synapticvesicles (SVs) available for AP-evoked release is limited. Many auditory brainstems synapsesmust sustain fast and repetitive SV release to encode sound information. Therefore soundencoding places great demands on the temporal dynamics of SV release and replenishment. Akey step regulating AP evoked SV release is priming the process that creates fusion competentSVs in close proximity to voltage-gated CaV2 channels (CaV). The rate of priming and SVreplenishment is highly dependent on the magnitude of presynaptic Ca2+ through CaV2 channels.Human mutations in the molecules regulating priming result in dysregulation of SV release whichis the cause of many auditory and neurological disorders.In mammals the pathway between the globular bushy cells (GBCs) and the medial nucleus ofthe trapezoid body neurons (MNTB) is critical for encoding sound localization and temporalfeatures of sound in music and communication found in animal vocalizations to human speech.The GBC axon forms the calyx of Held a glutamatergic presynaptic terminal that is the sole inputthat drives AP spiking in the MNTB. The calyx uses fast SV release kinetics to relay the patternsof afferent AP spikes in the cochlear nucleus to the MNTB. This in turn results in rapid andprecise inhibition of key mono- and binaural cell groups. It is emerging that aberrant MNTBsignaling underlies sound localization and speech perception defects in the aging population andcan contribute to central auditory defects found in neurological disorders. Therefore our goal isto delineate the molecular mechanisms regulating the temporal dynamics of SV release andreplenishment required for proper auditory information processing. Given the importance ofpriming in synaptic transmission as well as the pathological consequences of aberrant SVrelease our findings will provide fundamental insights into how information is encoded by thenervous system and are expected to facilitate the development of treatments for a wide range ofneurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.","Actins;Action Potentials;Animal Vocalization;Auditory;Auditory Perceptual Disorders;Auditory system;Automobile Driving;Axon;Behavioral;Binaural;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain Stem;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Central Auditory Processing Disorder;Cochlear nucleus;Communication;Cytoskeleton;Data;Defect;Electron Microscopy;Evoked Potentials;Frequencies;Glutamates;Goals;Hearing;Hearing problem;Human;Intellectual functioning disability;Kinetics;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Link;Location;Mammals;Medial;Molecular;Mus;Music;Mutation;Nervous system structure;Neurons;P-Q type voltage-dependent calcium channel;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Physiological;Presynaptic Terminals;Probability;Process;Publishing;Regulation;Research;Role;Signal Transduction;Slice;Sound Localization;Source;Speech;Speech Perception;Speech Sound;Spike Potential;Stimulus;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles;Synaptic plasticity;Techniques;Testing;Viral Vector;Whole-Cell Recordings;aging population;auditory processing;autism spectrum disorder;base;conditional knockout;gutless adenoviral vector;in vivo;information processing;insight;mouse model;mutant;negative affect;nervous system disorder;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel;operation;presynaptic;response;sound;synaptic depression;therapy development;trapezoid body;vesicular release;voltage","Regulation of Synaptic Vesicle Dynamics in the Auditory System","Project NarrativeThe goal of this project is to reveal the molecular mechanisms that enable synapses to rapidlymodulate and sustain synaptic transmission for the proper encoding of auditory information.Inability to do so underpins problems with speech perception and sound localization in the agingpopulation auditory processing disorder and contributes to central auditory deficits inneurological disorders.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Nanotechnology; Pediatric; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human; Transplantation","Project Summary Autografts and allografts are current standard strategies for bone repair of oral and craniofacial defects.However each possesses limitations such as donor-site morbidity with the use of autograft and the risk of dis-ease transmission with the use of allograft. Synthetic bone-graft substitute based on a tissue engineering strat-egy has represented an alternative approach to overcome these inherent limitations. MicroRNAs (miRs) aresmall non-coding RNAs that have emerged as important transcriptional regulators in both physiologic andpathophysiological conditions. We have previously shown that members of the miR-200 family actively regulateosteogenic differentiation bone development and inflammation. Our long-term goal is to develop a miR-basedgene therapy program that can be used to effectively promote osteogenic differentiation and bone regenerationfor restoring oral and craniofacial bone defects. Our recent studies showed that miR-200c loaded in collagensponge promoted bone formation in vivo. We also observed that miR-200c up-regulated the activity of Wnt sig-naling and reduced Sox2 and Klf4. Relatedly miR-200a has been demonstrated to directly suppress Wnt andBMP/TGF signal pathways. In our preliminary studies we have shown that inhibiting miR-200a using our Plas-mid-based miR Inhibitor System (PMIS) can effectively improve osteogenic differentiation and bone formationin vivo. Our objectives in this application are to understand and optimize the molecular function of miR-200cand PMIS-200a (miR-200a inhibitor) on osteogenic differentiation and bone formation and to validate that theirlocal administration can be used to improve bone regeneration. The central hypothesis of this project is thatmiR-200c combined with miR-200a inhibition improve osteogenic differentiation by up-regulating Wnt and TGF-/BMP signaling. Plasmid miR-200c and PMIS-200a delivery can be optimized to promote bone regeneration fororal and craniofacial defects. In this project we will determine the molecular function of miR-200c on Wnt sig-naling and the roles of Sox2 and Klf4 in the osteogenic differentiation mediated by miR-200c (Aim 1). We willalso determine the function of PMIS-200a on osteogenic differentiation and bone formation by understandingthe regulation of PMIS-200a on Wnt and BMP/TGF signaling (Aim 2). We will improve the effectiveness ofmiR-200c and PMIS-200a by optimizing a gene delivery system using biodegradable nanoparticles. In the Aim3 we will use critical-sized calvarial defects and periodontitis-induced bone defects in rat models to investigatewhether miR-200c combined with PMIS-200a can induce significant bone regeneration in vivo. At the comple-tion of this project we will have significantly expanded our understanding of the molecular function of miR-200cand miR-200a inhibition and demonstrated the translational capabilities of these miRs for oral and craniofacialbone regeneration.","Affect;Allografting;Autologous Transplantation;Bioinformatics;Bone Development;Bone Regeneration;Bone Transplantation;Calvaria;Collagen;Craniofacial Abnormalities;DNA;Data;Defect;Effectiveness;Family;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Transcription;Glycolates;Goals;Human;In Vitro;Inflammation;Mediating;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;NF-kappa B;Non-Viral Vector;Oral;Osteogenesis;Pathway interactions;Periodontitis;Physiological;Plasmids;Porifera;Publishing;Rattus;Regenerative capacity;Regulation;Reporter Genes;Repression;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;System;Testing;Tissue Engineering;Transfection;Untranslated RNA;WNT Signaling Pathway;base;beta catenin;biomaterial compatibility;bone;bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell;craniofacial;craniofacial bone;cytokine;disease transmission;disorder risk;gene delivery system;gene therapy;improved;in vivo;in vivo regeneration;inhibitor/antagonist;member;nanoparticle;novel therapeutics;osteogenic;overexpression;programs;standard care;therapeutic miRNA;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing","Oral and Craniofacial Bone Regeneration using MicroRNA Modulation","NarrativeThis project will demonstrate the molecular function mediated by members of the microRNA-200 family on theosteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and bone formation.

"Immunization; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Malaria; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related; Vector-Borne Diseases","AbstractMalarial remains a global health burden that impacts >40% of humans. Although bed nets and antimalarialdrugs have reduced the incidence and severity of malaria ~200000000 cases still occur annually with highmortality in children from sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally front line drug therapies are now threatened byspread of resistant parasites. Thus new approaches to effective vaccines and therapeutics are in need. Acritical limitation is our incomplete understanding of how the parasite manipulates host immune responses topermit chronic and recurring blood-stage infections. We used rodent malaria models to evaluate the cellulardynamics of the CD4 T cell and B cell responses generated during chronic blood-stage infection and thencompared these findings to humans living in endemic areas. These studies reveal that Tregs which expand inboth humans and rodents during blood-stage malaria interfere with conventional T helper (Th) responses andthe Follicular T helper (Tfh) cell:B cell partnership in germinal centers. Importantly the negative impact ofTregs occurs in a previously unrecognized but critical temporal window after infection to impede protectiveimmunity through CTLA-4. Precisely timed targeting of Tregs or CTLA-4 enhanced immune responsesaccelerated clearance and generated species-transcending immunity to blood-stage malaria. Thus ourpreliminary data uncover a critical mechanism of immune-suppression associated with blood-stage malaria. Afull understanding of the cellular and molecular basis for compromised immunity in blood-stage malaria is thelong-term goal of this competitive renewal application. We will address these issues with the following specificaims: SA 1: Determine how precisely timed Treg-depletion and CTLA-4 blockade impacts malaria-specific Tcell and B cell responses to facilitate clearance of PRIMARY blood-stage infections. SA 2: Determine howprecisely timed Treg-depletion and/or CTLA-4 blockade impacts malaria-specific memory T cell and B cellresponses to facilitate species transcending control of SECONDARY blood-stage infections.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY:Humans are the only natural reservoir for the extremely contagious measles virus (MeV). Thus a criticalchallenge for MeV study is identification of representative human model systems. For decades MeV wasthought to enter the human host through the apical surface of airway cells a misconception based on studiesin immortalized cell lines. Well-differentiated primary cultures of airways epithelial cells from human donors(HAE) provide a more physiological relevant model of human airways. Using HAE we found that MeVexclusively enters the basolateral membrane. This observation lead to a completely new paradigm for howMeV enters the human host. In addition to basolateral entry we observed that MeV infection of HAE results inthe formation of infectious centers that retain intact plasma membranes and are substantially different thanthe syncytia observed in immortalized cells. Infectious centers differ from syncytia in two important ways: 1)infectious centers stop growing 3-4 days post-infection and 2) infectious centers disappear after ~10 daysleaving the cell layer intact. Why infectious centers stop growing and how they disappear in HAE remain amystery and is the focus of this application. We hypothesize that infectious center formation in the respiratoryepithelium is a vital step in the final amplification process before release to the next host. In Aim 1 we definethe innate immune response pathways in the airways. We quantify 14 antiviral sentinel genes at 12 timepointsranging from 6 hours to 2 weeks. In addition laser capture of infectious centers is used to isolate infected cellsfrom uninfected cells within an epithelial sheet and deep sequencing is used to map the cellular response toMeV. In Aim 2 we address how MeV is released from HAE. Preliminary data suggest that infectious centersare shed intact from the HAE (rather than rupturing). The timecourse and frequency of shedding will bedefined. The roles of cell proliferation and cell death pathways will be probed by cell labeling to discern howlarge infectious centers can be released yet the epithelial integrity is maintained. MeV mediated cytoskeletalmodifications are likely to be mechanistically involved in infectious center release which we test usinginhibitors of F-actin treadmilling. In Aim 3 we hypothesize that shed infectious centers are physiologicallyrelevant vectors for MeV delivery.

The unprecedented economicdisruption and social isolation caused by the pandemic may disproportionately cause long-lasting andpotentially irreversible negative impacts to this at-risk group. The proposed research will focus oneconomic circumstances and social behaviors that affect the health and welfare of over 800 older adultparticipants and their ~400 middle-aged adult children. We will utilize the Family Transitions Project thatoriginally began as a study of the rural family response to the severe recession in the agricultural economyin the U.S. during the 1980s and continues to this day. Thus we are uniquely positioned to examine theimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals and families in the context of over 30 years ofaccumulated prospective data. The proposed work will assess how COVID-19-associated changes ineconomic and social circumstances impact the health and welfare of individuals across two generationsof families. We propose to examine individual and family adjustment to economic circumstances andstressors that are affected by personal characteristics and life experiences and make recommendationsregarding new programs and social policies that increase resiliency of vulnerable populations in futurecrises. The goals of the parent grant are to systematically evaluate cognitive function in a normative agingpopulation and assess its association with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and proximal and cumulativeeconomic and social stress and to quantify how biological variables related to vascular risk factors (BMIhypertension smoking) as well as gender moderate these associations. This supplement will enhancethis work by addressing these questions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aims to beaddressed using supplementary funds are: (1) Investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on thehealth of older adults and their middle-aged adult children. We will evaluate the extent to which COVID-19-associated economic and social stressors such as financial hardship and emotional distress haveimpacted individuals health status management of pre-existing chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes)behaviors that affect health (e.g. smoking substance use exercising) and cognitive functioning. (2)Investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family welfare across generations. We will assessthe impact of economic and social stressors resulting from COVID-19 on social behaviors and familyfunctioning between generations. During this time of crisis we will examine the intergenerationaltransmission of economic circumstances emotional well-being and social behaviors (e.g. substance use)and assess the impact of COVID-19 stressors on family processes such as the quality of marital and parent-child relationships.","Address;Adult Children;Affect;Aging;Agriculture;Archives;Behavior;Biological;Biological Markers;Body mass index;COVID-19;COVID-19 pandemic;Characteristics;Child;Chronic Disease;Collection;Communities;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease Management;Economics;Elderly;Exercise;Failure;Family;Family Process;Financial Hardship;Funding;Future;Gender;Generations;Goals;Health;Health Status;Hypertension;Individual;International;Life;Life Experience;Light;Longitudinal Studies;Mission;Occupational;Parent-Child Relations;Participant;Personality Traits;Population;Positioning Attribute;Process;Public Health;Recommendation;Research;Resources;Risk;Rural;Smoking;Social Behavior;Social Policies;Social isolation;Stress;Thick;Time;Visit;Vulnerable Populations;Well in self;Work;aged;aging population;cognitive function;cohort;economic impact;emotional distress;intergenerational;middle age;next generation;pandemic disease;parent grant;preventive intervention;programs;prospective;resilience;response;retinal nerve fiber layer;rural families;social;social stress;social stressor;stressor;substance use;therapy design;transmission process;vascular risk factor;welfare","Predicting cognitive function: Biomarkers and economics in a rural aged cohort","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis project supplement is relevant to the NIA mission because it addresses the potentially disproportionate effectsof the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on older individuals.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryClostridioides (Clostridium) difficile infections strike close to 500000 people a year in the United Statesleading to nearly 30000 deaths. The CDC has declared this organism an urgent threat to public health thehighest threat category. New treatments are sorely needed. Here we focus on the C. difficile cell envelopebecause it is a common target of antimicrobial therapy as evidenced by antibiotics including penicillinvancomycin and bacitracin as well as components of the innate immune system. The C. difficile cell envelopehas some unusual features that may prove to be unique targets for antibiotics. Lysozyme which kills cells bycleaving the peptidoglycan. We isolated mutants of C. difficile with increased resistance to lysozyme and weidentified two regulatory systems that when constitutively active increase lysozyme resistance. The C. difficilegenome contains a relatively large number of two component systems of which few have been studied. It isimportant to understand how C. difficile senses extracellular stresses and how these regulatory systemscontrol biogenesis of the cell envelope. We will pursue two specific aims to understand the role of theseregulators in controlling cell envelope biogenesis. In Aim 1 we will construct a series of mutants that have gainof function and loss of function mutations in these regulatory systems. These mutants will then be studied fortheir effect on resistance to a number of cell envelope stresses and effects on cell envelope biogenesis. Thiswill provide a greater understanding of the phenotypic effects of these two-component systems. In Aim 2 wewill map the promoters of some genes we have identified whose expression is dependent upon theseregulators. We will also define the regulons of both response regulators using RNA-seq. Finally we will useCRISPR interference and overexpression to identify individual genes required for lysozyme resistance and cellenvelope maintenance. Together these aims will advance our understanding of C. difficile biology by definingthe role of two different two-component system in controlling cell envelope maintenance.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention","Project SummaryNeural processes that influence school readiness in early childhood a key time for intervention and thecognitive processes that explain how parenting and neural processes influence school readiness remain poorlyunderstood. There is a critical need to determine how cognitive control and its neural underpinnings developand how these are influenced by parenting practices. The long-term goal is to develop more effective science-based interventions for behavioral and academic problems in children. The overall objective for the proposedlongitudinal project is to determine how specific parenting processes neural processes and cognitive controlprocesses promote school readiness in the transition from preschool to school entry. Our central hypothesis isthat delayed development of cognitive controlat neural and psychological levelsresults in cognitive controldeficits in early childhood that prevent automatization and lead to the downstream development ofexternalizing and academic problems. Ineffective parenting practices are likely a key cause of delayeddevelopment of cognitive control. The rationale for the proposed research is that a detailed understanding ofmechanistic pathways that explain how parenting and neural processes influence school readiness will enablethe identification of novel strategies to prevent behavioral and academic problems. Guided by strongpreliminary data we will test the central hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify neural indicatorsof cognitive control in early childhood that predict development of school readiness 2) Identify cognitive controlprocesses that explain how neural processes predict school readiness and 3) Identify parenting practices thatpredict development of neural processes and cognitive control. Aim 1 will determine the extent to whichresponse inhibition (N2 event-related potential ERP) and novelty detection (P3 ERP) predict development ofschool readiness based on tests of academic skills and reports of externalizing behavior problems by parentsand teachers. Aim 2 will identify the extent to which the neural indicators of cognitive control predict cognitivecontrol on laboratory tasks which in turn lead to school readiness. Aim 3 will determine the degree to whichparenting sensitivity autonomy support and consistency that have been robustly associated with schoolreadiness predict neural and cognitive control processes that in turn predict school readiness. The proposedresearch is innovative because it employs a new and transformative method of assessing cognitive control atmultiple levels of analysis (neural and psychological) longitudinally and in relation to parenting and schoolreadiness in early childhood. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to enable the designof early intervention and prevention strategies targeted to enhance children's response inhibition and noveltydetection translating to better cognitive control and school readiness. Ultimately the results of the proposedresearch are expected to help develop strategies that identify and target young children at risk for a lack ofcognitive control skills needed for school readiness and later success.","7 year old;Academic skills;Adult;Age;Aggressive behavior;Attentional deficit;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Brain;Child;Child Rearing;Cognition;Competence;Data;Detection;Development;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Early identification;Electroencephalography;Environment;Event-Related Potentials;Goals;Intervention;Laboratories;Lead;Mathematics;Mediating;Methods;Mission;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Nursery Schools;Outcome;Parents;Pathway interactions;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Problem behavior;Process;Public Health;Readiness;Reading;Reporting;Research;Risk;Schools;Science;Structure;Student Dropouts;System;Testing;Time;Translating;base;cognitive control;cognitive development;cognitive process;conduct problem;design;early childhood;externalizing behavior;frontal lobe;innovation;kindergarten;longitudinal analysis;neurodevelopment;neuroregulation;novel strategies;peer;performance based measurement;prevent;psychologic;psychosocial;relating to nervous system;response;scaffold;skills;success;sustained attention;teacher","Cognitive Control in the Development of School Readiness in Early Childhood","Project NarrativeThe proposed project is relevant to public health because early identification of behavioral and academicdeficits for school readiness is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of more severe outcomes such asconduct problems problems with peer interactions and school dropout.

"Genetics; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","ABSTRACTHuman laminopathies are caused by mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamina (NL)proteins. These proteins form an extensive network that lies beneath the inner nuclearmembrane. A unifying disease model suggests that lost tissue homeostasis is due to afailure to maintain adult stem cells. Although NL proteins responsible for laminopathieshave been identified it remains unclear how these proteins maintain healthy stem cellpopulations and promote tissue homeostasis. The conserved NL family of LEM-domain(LEM-D) proteins play a critical role in building nuclear structure and the NL. LEM-Dproteins bind Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) a conserved double stranded DNAand histone binding protein. Interactions between LEM-D proteins and BAF targetnuclear membranes to chromosomes during nuclear assembly after mitosis. In additionLEM-D proteins interact with BAF to tether the genome to the nuclear periphery andestablish repressed chromatin domains in non-dividing cells. We investigate theDrosophila LEM-D family focusing on Otefin a LEM-D protein that is required forsurvival of adult germline stem cells (GSCs). The otefin mutant GSCs carry structuraldeformities of the NL and chromatin changes that are shared with laminopathic cells. Mylab discovered that these mutant GSCs die because of activation of a novel checkpointpathway that uses two DNA damage response (DDR) kinases ATR and Checkpointkinase 2 (Chk2). Although otefin mutant GSCs carry DNA damage damageaccumulation depends upon Chk2 demonstrating that DNA damage results fromcheckpoint activation. Based on these and other data we hypothesize that NLdeformation is responsible for activation of ATR and Chk2 a prediction supported byemerging evidence that ATR is a global sensor of structural deformities of cellularcomponents. In this proposal two Aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will define themechanism of ATR/Chk2 activation in otefin mutant GSCs. In Aim 2 we define Chk2-dependent pathways involved in GSC death. We expect our studies will have a broadimpact. Nuclear shape changes are shared features of laminopathies and prematureaging syndromes. We predict that activation of the NL checkpoint might contribute to loststem cell maintenance in these diseases.","ATR checkpoint;Adult;Affect;Binding;Binding Proteins;CHEK2 gene;Cell Death;Cell Maintenance;Cells;Cessation of life;Chromatin;Chromosomes;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complex;Cyst;Cytology;DNA;DNA Damage;Data;Defect;Deformity;Development;Disease;Disease model;Drosophila genus;Failure;Family;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genome;Germ Cells;Health;Heterochromatin;High-Throughput RNA Sequencing;Homeostasis;Human;Interphase Cell;Lead;Link;Membrane;Mitosis;Monitor;Mutation;Nuclear;Nuclear Envelope;Nuclear Inner Membrane;Nuclear Lamina;Nuclear Structure;Ontology;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Play;Premature aging syndrome;Proteins;Role;Shapes;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Skin;Stress;Structural defect;Structure;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Tissues;Transcriptional Activation;Variant;adult stem cell;barrier-to-autointegration factor;base;bone;delta protein;ds-DNA;experimental study;germline stem cells;histone-binding proteins;improved;knock-down;mutant;novel;overexpression;prevent;response;sensor;stem cell homeostasis;stem cell population;stem cell survival;stem cells;therapeutic development;tool;transcription factor;transcriptome","The Role of LEM Domain Proteins in Nuclear Function","PROJECT NARRATIVEHuman laminopathies are caused by mutations in genes encoding nuclear lamina (NL)proteins that alter nuclear structure and resulted in loss of adult stem cell maintenance.We discovered that structural deformities of the NL activate a novle checkpoint pathwaythat leads to stem cell death.

"Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","[PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT] Current endodontic therapy for dental caries which are one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in theworld is a procedure for replacing the vital pulp with synthetic pulp-capping materials. Pulpless teeth can losetheir functions to sense environmental changes and maintain dentin regeneration and the synthetic materialshave several disadvantages such as bacterial leakage into the dental pulp poor cohesive strength discolorationof tooth and long setting time. As an alternative vital pulp therapy (VPT) which is defined as a restorative dentaltreatment that aims to preserve and maintain pulp tissue is beneficial for young patients who have high healingcapacity for pulp regeneration. Potential for successful VPT and pulp regeneration is increasing due to theknowledge of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can differentiate into specialized cells. However thetransplantation of MSCs incurs high costs and risks associated with the ex vivo cell expansion. Consequently acell homing strategy which recruits endogenous dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) is the effective approach inendodontics. Recently exosomes have attracted attention due to their great potential to promote intercellularcommunication leading to enhanced cell recruitment differentiation to specific cell lineage and tissueregeneration. In particular conditioned medium or exosomes cultured under lineage-specific differentiation havea great potential for angiogenesis and odontogenesis for pulp regeneration. The long-term goal is to develop a pulp capping material system for vital pulp therapy of human dental pulp.The overall objectives for this application are (1) to elucidate the therapeutic potential of characterized exosomesas a chemoattractant to stimulate DPSC migration and pulp-like differentiation and (2) to determine their in vivoeffect of pulp regeneration in a rabbit partial pulpotomy model. Our central hypothesis is that exosomes willstimulate dental pulp regeneration by promoting DPSC chemotaxis and lineage-specific differentiation.Exosomes will be isolated from rabbit DPSCs cultured under growth or lineage-specific differentiation conditions(odontogenesis or angiogenesis) and will be encapsulated in injectable hydrogel (F-127/hyaluronic acid) whichhas temperature-sensitive gelation behavior at body temperature. Specific aims in this proposed study are (1)characterize DPSC-Exos and determine the effect of DPSC-Exos on in vitro cell homing and lineage-specificdifferentiation and (2) evaluate the in vivo effects of DPSC-Exos on pulp regeneration in a rabbit partial pulpotomy. At the completion of the proposed R03 project our expected outcomes are to define the therapeutic potentialof DPSC-Exos for dental pulp regeneration and to identify miRNAs that may regulate cell homing and pulp tissueformation. These results will have a very important positive impact by providing preliminary data for our futureR01 grant application in which we plan to synthesize miRNAs loaded in engineered exosomes thereby replacingDPSC culture as a potential means of exosome production.","Alkaline Phosphatase;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Applications Grants;Attention;Behavior;Biological Assay;Blood;Body Temperature;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Lineage;Cells;Chemotactic Factors;Chemotaxis;Communicable Diseases;Conditioned Culture Media;Cultured Cells;Data;Dental;Dental Pulp;Dental Pulp Capping;Dental caries;Dentin;Disadvantaged;Encapsulated;Endodontics;Endothelium;Extravasation;Fibrin;Future;Goals;Growth;Histologic;Homing;Human;Hyaluronic Acid;Hydrogels;In Vitro;Incisor;Inflammatory;Injectable;Knowledge;Long-Term Effects;Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;MicroRNAs;Minerals;Modeling;Morphology;Natural regeneration;Necrosis;Nonvital Tooth;Odontoblasts;Odontogenesis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral cavity;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;Paste substance;Patients;Play;Procedures;Production;Property;Prosthesis;Pulpitis;Pulpotomy;Risk;Role;Structure;System;Temperature;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Tooth Discoloration;Tooth structure;Toxic effect;Tube;Undifferentiated;angiogenesis;base;biomaterial compatibility;blood vessel development;calcium hydroxide;cell motility;cohesion;cost;engineered exosomes;environmental change;exosome;healing;in vivo;intercellular communication;miRNA expression profiling;next generation sequencing;novel;preservation;progenitor;protein biomarkers;pulp capping material;recruit;regenerative;response;scaffold;seal;stem cell migration;stem cells;tissue regeneration;tissue repair;uptake","Exosome-based Cell Homing and Lineage-Specific Differentiation Strategies for Dental Pulp Regeneration","[PROJECT NARRATIVE] Vital pulp therapy is defined as a restorative dental treatment that aims to preserve and maintain pulp tissuehowever the current approach via pulp-capping materials is limited to tooth revitalization/revascularization withnecrotic pulp.

In these disorders the protein alpha-synucleinaccumulates into pathognomonic Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Patients with Lewy Body dementia havediffuse intracellular cortical Lewy Bodies cortical thinning and loss of neuronal anatomy including dendritesand spines. These changes may occur due to altered calcium regulation caused by alpha-synuclein oligomerswhich accumulate under pathologic conditions. Overexpression of alpha-synuclein in humans leads to familialdisease including dementia and therefore provides a useful model to evaluate the mechanisms of neuronaldysfunction. This proposal uses viral overexpression of alpha-synuclein in the cortex of mice to examine thepathological changes occurring in cortical neurons as the protein accumulates. Specifically this proposal firsttests the hypothesis that local alpha-synuclein accumulation induces dendritic spine instability leading todendritic spine loss overtime. This is tested using longitudinal live animal 2-photon imaging to repeatedlyobserve individual dendritic spines as pathology develops. Secondly this proposal evaluates if calciumdynamics change over time due to alpha-synuclein accumulation a potential mechanism for networkdysfunction and anatomical pathology. The findings from this proposal will demonstrate how a-synuclein exertsits pathological effect in cortical cells and evaluate a mechanistic model based on Ca2+ dynamics. By includingevaluation over time these studies are more likely to model aspects of human disease and lead to translatabletreatments. As a career development grant this proposal is ideal; it leverages the applicants past skills in 2-photon imaging of dendritic spines with a complementary mechanistic and computational approach using Ca2+imaging which is novel to the applicant. The institution is dedicated to providing the support and resourcesnecessary for the applicants success. There is strong mentorship available in areas of research proposedsupplemented with instruction by consultants and formal workshops. Together this will provide key trainingopportunities that will advance the applicants career as an academic physician-scientist focusing onunderstanding and treating Lewy Body Dementias.","Affect;Age;Anatomy;Animals;Applications Grants;Area;Axon;Brain Diseases;Brain Stem;Calcium;Caregiver Burden;Cells;Cephalic;Characteristics;Computer Analysis;Conscious;Data;Dementia;Dementia with Lewy Bodies;Dendrites;Dendritic Spines;Deposition;Development;Diffuse;Disease;Educational workshop;Evaluation;Familial disease;Functional disorder;Hallucinations;Homeostasis;Human;Image;Incidence;Individual;Injections;Institution;Instruction;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knowledge;Lead;Lewy Bodies;Lewy Body Dementia;Lewy Body Disease;Lewy neurites;Link;Literature;Measures;Mediating;Mental Depression;Mentors;Mentorship;Modeling;Monitor;Mus;N-Methylaspartate;NMDA receptor antagonist;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuronal Dysfunction;Neurons;Parkinson&apos;s Dementia;Pathologic;Pathologic Processes;Pathology;Patients;Physicians;Population;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevalence;Property;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Resources;Role;Scientist;Secondary to;Sleep disturbances;Societies;Structure;Synapses;Techniques;Testing;Thinness;Time;Training;Vertebral column;Viral;Visual Hallucination;Work;alpha synuclein;awake;base;career;career development;cranium;density;disability;experience;falls;human disease;in vivo;in vivo calcium imaging;insight;network dysfunction;neuron loss;neuronal circuitry;novel;overexpression;protein function;serial imaging;skills;sleep abnormalities;success;training opportunity;two photon microscopy;two-photon","Cortical Mechanisms in Lewy Body Dementia","Project NarrativeAlpha-synuclein is a protein involved in multiple neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons diseasedementia and dementia with Lewy Bodies.

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric","The proposed University of Iowa Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (UI NeuroNEXT) site has a long-standing history of leadership in clinical research with cross-departmental collaboration and involvement in clinical research networks. The UI NeuroNEXT site will capitalize on the interdisciplinary clinical research relationships already in place between the departments of Neurology Pediatrics Psychiatry Neurosurgery Radiology the UI Institute of Clinical and Translational Research and the Institute for Neuroscience Initiatives. Unique to the UI NeuroNEXT clinical research site proposal is 1) the combined close leadership from the Departments of Neurology and Pediatrics (Child Neurology Division) with relationships across the state that enhance recruitment from a rural population and 2) experienced mentors and educators in clinical research and design including physicians biostatisticians and epidemiologists. The UI clinical neurology program services people across the state of Iowa and from surrounding states (e.g. North Dakota South Dakota and Nebraska). The population is quite stable facilitating retention in studies. The UIs unique ability to recruit and retain subjects with disease that span the range of potential NeuroNEXT proposals from a geographically stable rural setting will enhance the broad applicability of any results from NeuroNEXT trials.  As a result of the UI NeuroNEXT sites extensive clinical research experience the research coordinators associated with this proposal have many years of experience in neuroscience clinical trials. This experience further contributes to the excellent recruitment and retention of subjects in ongoing studies. The lead research coordinator and the lead pediatric research coordinator for this site are both experienced in management of multi-site trials similar to NeuroNEXT trials and will provide senior leadership for specific study coordinators.  The pool for NeuroNEXT fellows will come from our junior faculty current clinical and research fellows and residents who have completed the R25 research training program and are planning to develop a clinical research career. The education initiatives for early investigators and for the NeuroNEXT fellow will be led by the Career Enhancement Director along with the co-PIs. The Clinical Trials Methodology Course a national NIH funded training course for developing research proposals and led by one of the PIs for this proposal will be an important resource. Another resource for fellows includes the UI ICTS clinical research curriculum that can lead to a Masters degree. NeuroNEXT fellows and other clinician researchers will also learn from their mentored involvement in NeuroNEXT studies.  The UI NeuroNEXT clinical research site will be an active addition to the NeuroNEXT network. We will offer excellent recruitment and retention and participate in NeuroNEXT committees and education initiatives. The Site will develop and submit clinical studies for consideration by the NeuroNEXT network and will work to increase the number of successful clinical researchers through educational opportunities.","Academic Medical Centers;Adult;Age;Basic Science;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Child;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Cooperative Group;Clinical Trials Design;Clinical Trials Network;Collaborations;Communities;Community Outreach;Contracts;Disease;Education;Educational Curriculum;Epidemiologist;Faculty;Funding;Geography;Goals;Institutes;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;International;Iowa;Iowan;Lead;Leadership;Learning;Master&apos;s Degree;Mentors;Mentorship;Methodology;Multicenter Studies;Muscular Dystrophies;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Nebraska;Neurology;Neuropathy;Neurosciences;Neurosciences Research;North Dakota;Pediatric Neurology;Pediatric Research;Pediatrics;Physicians;Population;Positioning Attribute;Psychiatry;Radiology Specialty;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Design;Research Institute;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Research Training;Resources;Role;Rural Population;Site;South Dakota;Tissue Banks;Training;Training Programs;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Vocational Guidance;Work;acute stroke;career;cerebrovascular;clinical care;clinical development;clinical research site;clinically relevant;design;dystroglycanopathy;experience;improved;innovation;multi-site trial;nervous system disorder;neurosurgery;outreach;outreach program;pediatric patients;programs;recruit;research and development;research study;rural setting;service programs;stroke therapy;success;training opportunity;translational scientist;translational study","The University of Iowa's NeuroNEXT Clinical Research Site","The University of Iowa Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (UI NeuroNEXT) site provides a strong long-standing clinical research history with cross-departmental collaboration and successful involvement in clinical research networks.

Tosubstantially improve and extend its capability we will develop Deep LOGISMOS that combines andreinforces the complementary advantages of LOGISMOS and deep learning (DL).There is growing need for quantitative failure-free 3D and higher-D image analysis for diagnostic and/orplanning purposes. Examples of current use exist in radiation oncology cardiology ophthalmology andother areas of routine clinical medicine many of which however still rely on manual slice-by-slice tracing.This manual nature of such analyses hinders their use in precision medicine. Deep LOGISMOS researchproposed here will solve this problem and will offer routine efficient analysis of clinical images ofanalyzable quality.To stimulate a new phase of this research project we hypothesize that: Advanced graph-based imagesegmentation algorithms when combined with deep-learning-derived application/modality specificparameters and allowing highly efficient expert-analyst guidance working in concert with thesegmentation algorithms will significantly increase quantitative analysis performance in routinelyacquired complex diagnostic-quality medical images across diverse application areas.The proposed research focuses on establishing an image segmentation and analysis frameworkcombining the strengths of LOGISMOS and DL developing a new way to efficiently generate trainingdata necessary for learning from examples forming a failure-free strategy for 3D 4D and generally n-Dquantitative medical image analysis and discovering ways for automated segmentation quality control.We will fulfill these specific aims: 1. Develop an efficient approach for building large segmentation training datasets in 3D 4D n-D using assisted and suggestive annotations. 2. Develop Deep LOGISMOS combining two well-established algorithmic strategies  deep learning and LOGISMOS graph search. 3. Develop and validate methods employing deep learning for quality control of Deep LOGISMOS. 4.

While some CRC-related disparities have decreased (e.g. incidence and stage ofpresentation) disparities persist in the context of CRC screening (CRCS). Studies suggest that supportive andinformation-rich social networks both online and offline could improve CRCS among Black Americans. Agrowing body of evidence indicates the importance of online sources of health information seeking andscanning about CRC and CRCS but little is known about the impact of the messages that individuals areencountering on these platforms. Research on the content and volume of messages White and BlackAmericans encounter from online health information sources is still unclearparticularly regarding anydisparities that exist about what specific information is sought scanned or shared by Black Americans. Thereis a critical need to understand which messages resonate among populations at-risk for specific diseases (e.g.CRC) and who may have concerns about engaging in early detection behaviors (e.g. CRCS) and may facedisparities in exposure to public information online. The proposed project utilizes and applies novel cancercommunication surveillance approaches (e.g. natural language processing and crowdsourcing) to examinepublic health communication about CRC prevention and control. Aim 1 will use computational naturallanguage processing approaches to capture and analyze digital and social media information about CRC andCRCS to identify prominent messages sources and types of misinformation and information inequalities. Thisapproach offers an efficient effective and responsive method to monitor (mis)information and emergingmessages about CRCS. Aim 2 will use a crowdsourcing approach (wiki surveys) to assess populationperceptions of public information and messages about CRCS. Recruiting nationally representative samples ofWhite (N = 1000) and Black American (N = 1000) adults ages 45-74 we will use an innovative data collectionprocedure known as wiki surveys to rank candidate messages as potential message targets in strategic effortsto promote CRCS. For Aim 3 we will conduct a randomized controlled message trial (N = 1600) to determinethe validity of the wiki survey approach to selecting messages for targeted audience segments. We will usedata collected from Study 2 to identify four sets of messages with strong arguments respective to each targetaudiences rankings: highest rated messages for both audiences highest rated messages for target in-grouphighest rated messages for target out-group and middle-/median-rated messages. We will cross thosemessage categories with target audience (White/Black American) to test if messages selected via the wikisurvey are associated with intentions to adhere to screening recommendations in the future and share CRCSmessages. The project will offer evidence to help determine the validity and scalability of these novel methodswhich is essential to innovate formative research and evaluation approaches in the future.","Address;Adopted;Adult;Affect;African American;Age;Age-Years;Alcohols;Behavior;Belief;Cancer Control;Categories;Code;Colorectal Cancer;Communication;Communication Research;Data;Data Collection;Death Rate;Diagnosis;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Environment;Evaluation;Exposure to;Face;Foundations;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Health Policy;Health Promotion;Human;Incidence;Individual;Inequality;Information and Media;Knowledge;Light;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Misinformation;Monitor;Natural Language Processing;Not Hispanic or Latino;Perception;Population;Population Heterogeneity;Populations at Risk;Prevention;Procedures;Public Health;Public Opinion;Race;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Research;Research Personnel;Respondent;Risk;Sampling;Scanning;Social Network;Source;Survey Methodology;Surveys;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Tobacco;United States;Woman;caucasian American;colon cancer screening;colorectal cancer prevention;colorectal cancer risk;colorectal cancer screening;crowdsourcing;design;digital media;efficacy trial;evidence base;experimental study;formative assessment;health communication;high risk;improved;innovation;men;novel;novel strategies;preference;recruit;screening;screening guidelines;social media;wiki","Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening","PROJECT NARRATIVEEfforts to improve public health communication about colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening (CRCS)require understanding what information is commonly seen by target audiences and consideration of existinginformation and behavior disparities for populations at higher risk for CRC (e.g. Black Americans).

"Clinical Research; Neurosciences","AbstractActivity in the -frequency band (15-29Hz) is a highly prominent feature of neural recordings found acrossspecies recording techniques and spatial scales. Changes in -activity are particularly prominent during motorprocesses. Movement-related -activity can be observed in the cortical areas of the pyramidal motor system aswell as in the subcortical areas of the extrapyramidal motor system. Pathological -activity is a hallmark ofmovement disorders most prominently of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Indeed -activity is used both as aneurophysiological marker of disease progression in PD and as a target in newly developed cutting-edgetreatment methods such as closed-loop adaptive neurostimulation.However recent studies in non-human animals have cast a fundamental layer of doubt on the nature of thisneural signal and its relationship to behavior. Past studies of -activity have focused on averaged changes ofsignal-power across time (or across trials of a task) as is typical in neurophysiological studies. What recentstudies have shown however is that unaveraged -band activity is not characterized by the type of steady(de)synchronizations of activity that are found in the average. Instead  is characterized by short transientburst-like `events'. The burst-like nature of this signal however is lost in the average  and along with it thesystematic relationships that can be found between dynamics of these -burst events and motor control onindividual trials. Therefore there is a critical need to investigate how burst-like -events relate to both normaland pathological motor control in humans.We here propose a detailed systematic investigation of this relationship. In an extensive pilot investigation wehave found that both human movement initiation and movement cancellation are accompanied by highly specificand systematic patterns of non-invasively recorded -bursts. This suggests the overarching hypothesis that -bursts are a universal signature that signify inhibitory processes in the motor system. The work in this grantproposal aims to systematically test this guiding hypothesis by linking specific patterns of -bursts to establishedtheoretical models of motor inhibition in the human brain by investigating the origins of movement-related -bursts in both cortical and subcortical regions that constitute the human motor system and by providing causalevidence for the role of -bursts in conveying inhibitory motor control commands across the motor system.","Address;Affect;Animals;Applications Grants;Area;Basal Ganglia;Behavior;Brain;Clinical;Deep Brain Stimulation;Disease;Disease Marker;Disease Progression;Electroencephalography;Event;Frequencies;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Generations;Goals;Health;Human;Individual;Investigation;Knowledge;Lesion;Link;Location;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Motor;Motor Cortex;Movement;Movement Disorders;Nature;Parkinson Disease;Pathologic;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Physiological;Proactive Inhibition;Process;Reactive Inhibition;Research;Research Personnel;Resolution;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Speed;Symptoms;System;Techniques;Testing;Theoretical model;Time;Uncertainty;Work;base;cognitive control;frontal lobe;interest;motor control;neural circuit;neurophysiology;neurotransmission;novel;relating to nervous system;spatiotemporal","The role of cortical and subcortical -bursts in the cognitive control of human movement","Project NarrativeThe current proposal aims to investigate the dynamics of burst-like -frequency (15-29Hz) events in the humanneural field potential in relation to both healthy and abnormal motor control. -band activity is a key signature ofboth pathological and normal movement in humans but recent high-impact work has shown that existingresearch mischaracterized the burst-like nature of this signal casting doubt upon established relationshipsbetween -activity and movement.

"Aging; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","Mitochondrial homeostasis is required to maintain neuronal health and function and itsdysregulation plays prominent roles in rendering specific neural systems vulnerable. Recentlywe have found that the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; themammalian p38 ortholog) and the CREB like transcription factor ATF-7-mediated innateimmune pathway in the intestine of C. elegans can protect its neurons from degenerationinduced by mitochondrial dysfunction. The neuroprotective effects of p38MAPK/ATF-7immunity activated in the gut occurs through the enhancement of mitophagy andp38MAPK/ATF-7 activity in intestinal cells alone is sufficient to lower mitochondrial numbersnot only in intestinal cells but also in neurons. Moreover preliminary data obtained in our labshow that in C. elegans the peripheral increase in disease-related misfolded proteins candisrupt innate immune signaling pathways. Our central hypothesis therefore is thataging- and proteotoxicity-induced dysregulation of the immune system can disruptmitochondrial homeostasis in neurons initiating or aggravating neurodegeneration.The objective of the proposed research is to determine how the p38MAPK/ATF-7-mediatedinnate immune pathway activated in the gut in C. elegans affects mitochondrial homeostasisin neurons. To do this we will:Aim 1: Examine the role of the innate immune response in the maintenance of neuronsupon Complex I dysfunction.Aim 2: Identify the immune mediators in the gut that affect neuronal health.Aim 3: Examine the role of peripheral proteotoxic antigens in disrupting immune signalingleading to the accumulation of dysfunctional neuronal mitochondria.Our preliminary data show that the innate immune response modulates mitochondrialhomeostasis in a cell non-autonomous manner and is in turn can be inhibited by specificperipheral proteotoxic antigens. These studies therefore offer the novel possibility thatimmunosenescence is responsible for the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria andcould offer new insights into the role of proteotoxicity in the modulation of mitochondrialhomeostasis.","Affect;Aging;Animals;Antigens;Autophagocytosis;Biological Response Modifiers;CREB1 gene;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cells;Complex;Data;Disease;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Health;Homeostasis;Immune response;Immune signaling;Immune system;Immunity;Infiltration;Innate Immune Response;Intestines;Lead;MAP Kinase Gene;Maintenance;Mammalian Cell;Mediating;Mitochondria;Muscle Cells;Mutation;Natural Immunity;Nematoda;Nerve Degeneration;Nervous system structure;Neurons;Orthologous Gene;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Play;Predisposition;Proteins;RNA interference screen;Research;Role;Rotenone;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;System;Tissues;activating transcription factor;alpha synuclein;common cellular transcription factor ATF;dopaminergic neuron;gene product;immunosenescence;innate immune pathways;insight;misfolded protein;mitochondrial dysfunction;neuroprotection;novel;optogenetics;p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase;pathogen;proteotoxicity;relating to nervous system;response","Investigating how intestinal innate immunity confers neuroprotection using C. elegans","Mitochondrial homeostasis is required for maintenance of neuronal health and function.

The limitation of resources transport and supply chaindisruptions in the COVID-19 pandemic created some unique challenges. The simple process of providing O2supplementation has become very challenging in a rural small hospital a large hospital with makeshift hospitalrooms during emergency transport to the hospital during in-hospital transport of infected patients in developingnations with low-resource hospitals or at home for discharged patients. We propose to develop a novel oxygenconcentrator that generates oxygen through electrochemical principles. The electrochemical oxygen concentratorcan be especially valuable during the pandemic crisis owing to its unique merits over existing devices such assignificantly higher oxygen purity (>99%) at reasonable flow rates (1 LPM  5 LPM) lesser power consumptionless weight less noise and ease of manufacturing. This is a collaborative effort by an interdisciplinary team withexpertise in electrochemistry medical device design and critical care medicine.

"Biomedical Imaging; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Prevention; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Breast cancer has the highest incidence of cancer for women in the U.S. and across the world. Despiteadvances in technologyfrom film-screen images to Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) and now toDigital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)the yearly miss rate has remained stubbornly stable ranging between10-30% at screening. Technology alone is not reducing errors of omission; we need to understand the specificchallenges faced by the human readers interpreting the images and the specific errors that they lead to. Satisfaction of Search (SOS) refers to the fact that after having detected a first lesion in a case themiss rate for additional lesions in the same case is substantially elevated. This specific type of error has beenshown to account for 30% of misses in the domains of Radiology where it has been studied including chestradiography and Computed Tomography. And yet it has never been studied in the domain of breast cancer.Thus there is a critical need to determine how SOS contributes to errors in breast cancer screening. In the present project we will determine the rates of occurrence and the underlying causes of SOS inFFDM and DBT. We have devised a novel method that overcomes limitations of previous methods and that isoptimized for use in FFDM and DBT. Previous approaches to studying SOS involved the photographic additionof artificial lesions to images which is not feasible for breast imaging. Instead we will construct a database ofnaturally occurring cases that is structured for studying SOS. This will involve the collection of multiple-lesioncases and controlled single-lesions cases where the former are matched with the latter on key diagnosticdimensions such as lesion type lesion size and breast density. In two main experiments (one with FFDM andone with DBT) radiologists will read cases from the experimental set marking the locations and diagnoses forbenign and malignant lesions. Signal-detection analyses over dual- and single-lesion cases will be used toestimate the rate of SOS. Eye position and pupil diameter will be tracked as participants read each case.These data will allow us to assess the prevalence of different known causes of SOS: (a) prematuretermination in which search following first lesion detection is less comprehensive compared with single-lesioncontrol cases; (b) perceptual set in which after having detected a first lesion participants are biased to findsubsequent lesions with similar perceptual features leading to reduced sensitivity in the detection ofperceptually dissimilar targets; and (c) resource depletion in which the demands of maintaining informationabout a first-detected lesion in memory reduce available perceptual/cognitive resources thereby reducing theefficiency of subsequent search. Understanding the rates and underlying causes of SOS in breast cancerdetection will lay the foundation for planned future work to develop training programs and best practices thatmitigate the specific causes of SOS errors and thereby reduce miss rates in breast cancer screening.","Benign;Breast Cancer Detection;Caliber;Cause of Death;Chest;Cognitive;Collaborations;Collection;Data;Databases;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Digital Breast Tomosynthesis;Digital Mammography;Dimensions;Disease;Eye;Film;Foundations;Future;Goals;High Prevalence;Human;Image;Impairment;Incidence;Institution;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Lesion;Location;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammography;Measures;Medical Imaging;Memory;Methods;Modality;Participant;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Probability;Pupil;ROC Curve;Radiology Specialty;Reader;Reading;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Screening for cancer;Signal Detection Analysis;Source;Stimulus;Structure;Techniques;Technology;Thoracic Radiography;Three-Dimensional Image;Training;Training Programs;Triplet Multiple Birth;Visual;Woman;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;X-Ray Tomography;base;breast cancer diagnosis;breast density;breast imaging;cancer type;case control;cognitive capacity;expectation;experimental study;imaging modality;improved;interest;malignant breast neoplasm;novel;premature;programs;radiologist;response;satisfaction;screening;standard of care;visual search;visual tracking","Satisfaction of Search in Breast Cancer Detection","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe term Satisfaction of Search (SOS) refers to the phenomenon that one or more lesions are missed after afirst lesion has been reported in an image and SOS is responsible for up to 30% of all misses in the domainswhere it has been studied such as chest radiology.

"Aging; Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Clinical Research; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Networking and Information Technology R&D (NITRD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","Project Summary: Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem and arethe leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the specific degenerative processes that are activelyprogressing over the course of the illness is crucial for developing targeted drugs therapies and decidingtreatment options. Additionally understanding the structural connectivity changes to tease apart the specificcircuitry affected is crucial in developing circuit specific non-invasive brain stimulation therapies. Diffusion-based MRI assays can provide microstructural measures that are highly sensitive to (i) the neurodegenerativeprocesses and (ii) connectivity changes. Advanced modeling approaches can be utilized to further enhance thespecificity of the microstructural measures to the underlying neurodegenerative processes. However theirutility is often limited to pure white matter regions. At the typical spatial resolution of diffusion MRI (~2mmisotropic voxel size) significant partial volume effects exist in most brain voxels (e.g. voxels with multipletissue types heterogenous fibers with different properties). In whole brain studies this compromises thespecificity of the disease processes identified by the advanced modeling approaches; it also contributes toinaccurate connectivity mapping. Additionally the diffusion parameter encoding space is currently limited toone or two shells of low b-values (b<2000s/mm2) which limits the unique determination of several relevantmicrostructural parameters. The main objective of the proposal is the development validation and clinicaltranslation of a diffusion MRI assay that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space at sub-millimeter voxel resolution for joint microstructure and connectivity mapping in the whole brain. Our overallhypothesis is that the proposed framework can significantly improve the validity of microstructural modeling inmost brain voxels. The proposed development will make use of SNR-efficient 3D multi-slab acquisitions.Coupled with time-efficient sparse k-q sampling the encoding will span over multiple b-shells. To allow theunique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters multicompartmental T2 information will beutilized. The proposed developments will be enabled by two advanced reconstruction methods: structured low-rank matrix completion a novel integrative framework for MRI reconstructions that enables several capabilitiesincluding multi-echo imaging and self-calibrating reconstruction; and model-based deep learning a novel deeparchitecture to solve MR reconstruction algorithms using neural networks in a systematic fashion. Thesemethods overcome several inefficiencies associated with extending the 3D multi-slab acquisition for multi-dimensional imaging in the k-q-TE space. To ensure scientific rigor we will comprehensively validate ourtechnology on dedicated diffusion phantoms along with healthy volunteers using different quantificationmetrics. We also validate the capability of the dMRI assay using a multi-modal MRI study in a cross-sectionalstudy on a cohort of Huntington's disease.","3-Dimensional;Acceleration;Affect;Algorithms;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Animal Model;Architecture;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Brain;Cause of Death;Clinical Research;Complement;Coupled;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Demyelinations;Development;Diffusion;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Dimensions;Disadvantaged;Disease;Effectiveness of Interventions;Ensure;Fiber;Financial compensation;Health;Human;Huntington Disease;Image;Intervention;Iron;Joints;Lead;Learning Module;Link;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Morphologic artifacts;Motion;Myelin;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase II/III Trial;Physics;Play;Process;Property;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Recovery;Resolution;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Structure;Study models;Symptoms;Techniques;Technology;Time;Tissue Model;Tissues;Translations;Validation;Water;Work;World Health Organization;advanced disease;axonal degeneration;base;biophysical model;brain circuitry;clinical translation;cohort;deep learning;design;disability;effectiveness evaluation;health economics;healthy volunteer;high resolution imaging;image reconstruction;improved;in vivo;multimodality;neural network;neuroinflammation;neuron loss;noninvasive brain stimulation;novel;physical property;reconstruction;targeted treatment;white matter","Fast Multi-dimensional Diffusion MRI with Sparse Sampling and Model-based Deep Learning Reconstruction","PROJECT NARRATIVENeurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem affecting about 450 millionpeople worldwide are the leading cause of disability and ill-health according to world health organization.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Clinical Research; Kidney Disease; Neurosciences; Pediatric","Project Summary Pediatric chronic kidney disease (pCKD) is most commonly due to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract; thus meaning a lifetime of disease. Children with even mild CKD are at risk for neurocognitive difficulties specific to attention regulation academic underachievement and executive function [1-3]. Neurocognitive deficits have broad implication on quality of life as they contribute to poorer high school graduation rates and long-term underemployment in the adult CKD population [4]. The cognitive complications of pCKD are thought to represent sequelae of an aberrant kidney-brain axis whereby kidney impairment and associated disease sequelae may negatively impact the brain leading to increased risk of cognitive impairment in the course of pCKD progression [5-7]. However there is a critical gap in our understanding of the developing brain in the context of pCKD. Thus the overarching goal of this proposal is to quantify structural and functional brain differences using MRI and cognitive/behavioral assessments in pCKD participants with mild to moderate (early) CKD compared to unaffected controls. To our knowledge this proposal is the first in the world to quantitatively evaluate the brain in young children with early stage pCKD due to a focused disease etiology using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Preliminary data from our laboratory are striking and demonstrate robust structural brain differences (particularly within the cerebellum) in children with congenital non-glomerular causes of CKD compared to healthy peers. There appears to be a direct relationship between decreased cerebellum volume and impaired kidney function. Furthermore lower cerebellum gray matter volume appears to predict performance on neurocognitive tasks specific to executive function in children with CKD. Our pilot data demonstrate abnormal resting state connectivity in pCKD whereby children with CKD show hypo-connectivity between the cerebellum (dentate nucleus) and the frontal cortices. We will investigate a dosage effect of disease burden on neurodevelopment in children with mild/moderate CKD. Understanding the influence of pCKD progression and severity on the developing brain will allow enhanced awareness of the role of disease progression on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood and inform new approaches to patient care across the CKD lifespan.","Academic achievement;Acidosis;Address;Adolescent;Adult;Age;Attention;Awareness;Behavior;Behavior assessment;Biological Markers;Brain;Cerebellum;Child;Childhood;Chronic Kidney Failure;Cognition;Cognitive;Corpus Callosum;Data;Dentate nucleus;Development;Dialysis procedure;Disease;Disease Progression;Etiology;Glomerular Filtration Rate;Goals;Graduation Rates;Hypertension;Image;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Intelligence;Kidney;Kidney Diseases;Laboratories;Link;Longevity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Metabolism;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Neurocognition;Neurocognitive;Neurocognitive Deficit;Outcome;Participant;Patient Care;Patients;Performance;Pontine structure;Population;Publishing;Quality of life;Regulation;Renal function;Research;Research Proposals;Rest;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;School-Age Population;Severity of illness;Signal Transduction;Structure;Suggestion;Testing;Transplantation;Underachievement;Underemployment;Uremia;Urinary tract;anatomic imaging;brain abnormalities;burden of illness;cognitive performance;cohort;congenital anomaly;dosage;executive function;frontal lobe;gray matter;high school;improved;neurodevelopment;neuroimaging;novel;novel strategies;pediatric patients;peer;rho;white matter","Brain anatomical imaging and neurocognition in pediatric kidney disease (BRAIN KID)","Project NarrativeThis research proposal is directly focused on improving the lives of children and adolescents with kidney disease.

"Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYThe candidate is a dual-trained periodontist scientist who is committed to an academic career dedicated tostudy periodontal disease and improve oral health. Periodontitis is a polygenetic inflammatory responsetowards bacterial pathogens at the gingival surface and affects 47% of the adult population in the UnitedStates. This common oral disease without effective management eventually leads to tooth loss and issignificantly associated with systemic conditions such as diabetes. Analysis of a Genome Wide AssociationStudy (GWAS) for periodontitis has identified Tumor necrosis factor Receptor-Associated Factor 3 InteractingProtein 2 (TRAF3IP2) as a target gene of interest. TRAF3IP2 dysfunction such as induced by key geneticvariants is significantly associated with a periodontal inflammation phenotype defined by a high pathogenburden in plaque and local inflammation.TRAF3IP2 is a non-redundant adaptor molecule in the IL-17 pathwaywhich plays a critical role in mucosal defense. The objective of this research proposal is to acquire knowledgeof the TRAF3IP2-mediated IL-17 response in gingival barrier defense mechanisms and the variant-inducedfunctional defects in the IL-17 pathway. The candidate hypothesizes that loss of TRAF3IP2-IL17 signalingcompromises the oral epithelial barrier and mucosal inflammatory signature and promotes dysbioticmicrobiome overgrowth. This hypothesis will be tested by both in vitro and in vivo genetic approaches. UsingTraf3ip2 ablated mice the candidate will first determine the role of the IL-17/TRAF3IP2 pathway-modulatedimmune response and microbial community structure in a periodontal pathogen-induced murine alveolar boneloss model (Aim1). The candidate will then investigate the role of the IL-17/TRAF3IP2 pathway in mucosalphysical barrier function and mechanism of IL-17-regulated tight junction structure (Aim 2). The candidate willfurther determine the TRAF3IP2 variant effect on immune response as reflected by the transcriptional andpost-transcriptional regulation of chemokine synthesis and barrier function in genetically engineered humangingival epithelial cells (Aim 3). The implementation of this research proposal requires additional trainingincluding complex microbial community structure analysis Th17/IL-17 immunobiology epithelial biology andmolecular genomics. Strong mentorship by experts in each field and the exceptional environment at theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will foster the accomplishment of this research proposal andexpedite the career development of the candidate. The scientific component and training outlined in thisproposal provide a pathway to achieving not only the candidate's short-term goal which is to transition into anindependent investigator at a tenure track faculty position with R01 funding support but also the long-termgoal which is to update understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the mucosal surface. The expertisegained will facilitate the development of novel preventive diagnostic and therapeutic means to tackleperiodontal disease and improve oral health.","16S ribosomal RNA sequencing;Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Adult;Affect;Alleles;Alveolar Bone Loss;Biological Assay;Biology;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cells;Clinical;Co-Immunoprecipitations;Code;Complex;Data;Defect;Defense Mechanisms;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnostic;Disease;Environment;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Faculty;Feedback;Flow Cytometry;Fluorescence;Fostering;Functional disorder;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Engineering;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Gingiva;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;Human;IL17 Signaling Pathway;IL17 gene;Immune;Immune response;Immunobiology;Immunologic Surveillance;Immunoprecipitation;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-17;Intervention;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Linkage Disequilibrium;Mediating;Mentorship;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Mouth Diseases;Mucosal Immune Responses;Mucous Membrane;Mus;Necrosis;Neutrophil Infiltration;North Carolina;Oral;Oral health;Pathway interactions;Patients;Periodontal Diseases;Periodontitis;Pharmacology;Phase;Phenotype;Play;Population;Porphyromonas gingivalis;Positioning Attribute;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Preventive;Preventive treatment;Production;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;Scientist;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Structure;Surface;Systemic disease;TNF Receptor-Associated Factors;TNF gene;TRAF2 gene;TRAF6 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tight Junctions;Tissues;Tooth Loss;Tracer;Training;Transcriptional Activation;Transcriptional Regulation;United States;Universities;Update;Variant;Wild Type Mouse;career;career development;chemokine;cytokine;dysbiosis;genetic approach;genetic variant;genome wide association study;improved;in vivo;individualized medicine;interest;interleukin-22;intestinal epithelium;knock-down;loss of function;mRNA Stability;member;microCT;microbial;microbial community;microbial host;microbiome;neutrophil;novel;occludin;oral cavity epithelium;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;periodontopathogen;preclinical study;prevent;receptor;recruit;response;risk variant;tenure track;tool","Investigating the role of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Receptor Associated Factor 3 Interacting Protein 2 ","PROJECT NARRATIVEPeriodontitis is a polygenetic inflammatory response towards a dysbiotic plaque bacterial flora and affects 64.7million adult U.S. population.

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Lung","AbstractChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing cause of morbidity and mortality around theworld in countries of all levels of economic prosperity. COPD is a complex disorder characterized bypermanent airway ow obstruction that interferes with normal respiration. Imaging-based biomarkers areof increasing importance in our search to identify COPD phenotypes establishing homogeneoussub-populations to aid in genotyping and directing therapeutic interventions and associated outcomesassessment. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can describe the spatial distribution of diseasemeasure the extent of emphysema and small airways disease in COPD and detect concomitant diseasesuch as asthma brosis and cardiovascular disease.Some of the main obstacles in using CT imaging to study the lung are associated with achieving reliablelung volumes (levels of inspiration) during scanning variations in protocols across scans producingchanges in measured CT values and inter-site and inter-manufacturer differences which reduce thereproducibility of scanning in large multi-center trials. The use of CT is further limited by the currentpractice of using CT density-based thresholds to dene the location and extent of disease.We hypothesize that further advances in our understanding of COPD are possible by complementing CTdensity as the primary image-based indicator of disease with measurements of regional lung mechanics.We propose to study the biomechanics of the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcomes in COPD Study(SPIROMICS) cohort. We will look for differences in mechanical behavior across the SPIROMICS diseasestrata examine the impact of lobar anatomy and ssure integrity on lung mechanics and diseasedistribution and identify image-based biomarkers that are predictive of COPD progression by analyzingthe SPIROMICS data longitudinally.When complete this project will produce a database describing the biomechanics of the SPIROMICScohort identify descriptive biomarkers of COPD for subject phenotyping and create a disease progressionmodel based on lung biomechanics.","Age;Air;Algorithms;Anatomy;Asthma;Biological Markers;Biomechanics;Body mass index;Breathing;Cardiovascular Diseases;Categories;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Clinical Trials;Cohort Studies;Complement;Complex;Country;Data;Databases;Diagnosis;Diagnostic radiologic examination;Disease;Disease Progression;Economics;Fibrosis;Fissural;Follow-Up Studies;Gender;Genotype;Goals;Healthcare;Image;Individual;Intervention;Lobar;Lobe;Location;Lung;Lung diseases;Manufacturer Name;Measurement;Measures;Mechanics;Methods;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Multicenter Trials;Obstruction;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;Phenotype;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary Emphysema;Reproducibility;Residual volume;Respiration;Scanning;Site;Spatial Distribution;Spirometry;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Total Lung Capacity;Variant;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;cohort;cone-beam computed tomography;density;disease phenotype;follow-up;image processing;image registration;imaging biomarker;indexing;insight;lung lobe;lung volume;mechanical behavior;mortality;predictive marker;response;small airways disease;study population","Lung Biomechanics and Disease Progression in SPIROMICS","RelevanceChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a serious healthcare problem.

"Biodefense; Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention","AbstractChemical warfare nerve agents (CWNA) are increasingly used to attack civilians worldwide. Currently we lackeffective treatment for CWNA survivors. Until recently preventing acute death due to CWNA exposure hadtaken a top priority. However reports on the life-long health consequences of sarin attack survivors arebeginning to emerge. Like organophosphates (OPs) CWNAs are cholinesterase inhibitors and potentseizurogenic agents. In animal models acute CWNA/OP exposure induces status epilepticus (SE) and othercholinergic symptoms. The current medical countermeasures (MCM) such as atropine oxime anddiazepam/midazolam control symptoms but do not prevent long-term neurotoxicity and comorbidity primarilydue to persistent nitrooxidative stress neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We predict that acombination of neuroprotectant and MCM can prevent CWNA-induced long-term neurotoxicity. We proposeto investigate the long-term neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects of a novel inhibitor of NADPHoxidase (NOX2) mitoapocynin in rat diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and a nerve agent soman models.As proof of concept we demonstrated the neuroprotective and disease-modifying properties of NOX2 inhibitorsin the rat DFP and the mouse Parkinson's disease (PD) and seizure models. Treating mice or rats withmitoapocynin before the induction of SE with kainate (KA) or DFP significantly prevented the onset of convulsiveseizures suggesting its anti-seizure property. We further tested mitoapocynin and diapocynin in telemetry-implantedrats after inducing SE with KA or DFP and treating them with MCM. Both NOX2 inhibitors are blood-brain barrierpermeable. They prevented epileptogenesis in >50% rats and significantly reduced reactive gliosis andneurodegeneration. Although we had tested the proof of concept for the role of NOX2 in the rat DFP modelthe optimum dose of diapocynin used was too high (300 mg/kg) which cannot be extrapolated for humanuse. Therefore we developed characterized tested in vivo and patented (US8962600 B2) themitoapocynin which is effective at 10-30 times lesser dose than diapocynin. Our overarching hypothesisis that mitoapocynin counteracts CWNA-induced long-term neurodegeneration epileptogenesis and restoresbrain function. We will investigate this in both male and female rat DFP models (Specific Aim 1) and validatein soman model (Specific Aim 2). We will expose rats to DFP/soman treat with MCM and 2h later withmitoapocynin (30 mg/kg oral) or vehicle twice daily for the first three days and 6 weeks later conduct a batteryof behavioral tests. We will implant a telemetry device to monitor SRS and disease progression/modificationin real-time. To determine the protective effect of mitoapocynin we will conduct brain histochemistry forneurodegeneration and neuroinflammation nitro-oxidative stress assays and multiplex assay for cytokines.Our proposal embodies a novel translational approach targeting both neurodegeneration and epileptogenesisand may yield a novel orally-active therapy for CWNA-induced long-term neurotoxicity.","Acute;Address;Adult;Animal Model;Animals;Antiepileptogenic;Atropine;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Brain;Brain Diseases;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Chemical Warfare;Cholinesterase Inhibitors;Cognitive;Cues;Devices;Diazepam;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Dose;Electroencephalography;England;Epilepsy;Epileptogenesis;Exposure to;Female;Fostering;Gliosis;Health;Histocytochemistry;Hospitals;Hour;Human;Impairment;Implant;Inflammatory;Isoflurophate;Legal patent;Life;Malaysia;Midazolam;Mission;Modeling;Modification;Monitor;Motor;Motor Seizures;Mus;NADPH Oxidase;Nerve Degeneration;Neurologic;Neuroprotective Agents;Oral;Organophosphates;Oxidative Stress;Oximes;Parkinson Disease;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Populations at Risk;Property;Publications;Rattus;Recurrence;Reporting;Research Support;Role;Role Concepts;Sarin;Seizures;Serum;Soman;Sprague-Dawley Rats;Status Epilepticus;Stress;Survivors;Symptoms;Syria;Telemetry;Terrorism;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tokyo;Wireless Technology;behavior test;blood-brain barrier permeabilization;chemical threat;cholinergic;comorbidity;conditioned fear;cytokine;effective therapy;experimental study;forced swim test;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;inhibitor/antagonist;kainate;male;medical countermeasure;multiplex assay;nerve agent;neuroinflammation;neuroprotection;neurotoxicity;novel;prevent;programs;protective effect;psychologic;research and development;toxic organophosphate insecticide exposure;translational approach","Mitoapocynin a novel NOX2 inhibitor mitigates nerve agents induced longterm neurotoxicity","Project NarrativeOrganophosphate nerve agents such as sarin and soman are classified as extremely lethal chemical warfarenerve agents (CWNA) likely to be abused in terrorism.

"Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","Project SummaryOne in twenty-six Americans will develop epilepsy during their lifetime. Unfortunately one-third of epilepsypatients will not achieve seizure freedom with conventional therapies. These patients are at greatest risk forsudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy.While the exact etiology of SUDEP is unknown it is thought that cardiorespiratory dysfunction and arousalimpairment are involved. Suppression of EEG activity following a seizure or post-ictal generalized EEGsuppression (PGES) may correlate with SUDEP risk. The origin of PGES is unknown but during PGESpatients experience stupor and unresponsiveness. Serotonin (5-HT) is broadly implicated in SUDEP due to itsrole breathing sleep/wakefulness and arousal. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a key source of 5-HTprojections. DRN 5-HT activity is depressed by seizures. We hypothesize PGES may represent anelectrographic marker of impaired arousal consequent to seizure-induced DRN dysregulation. Our preliminarydata in mice indicate that systemic application of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or directchemical or optogenetic stimulation of DRN 5-HT neurons prior to an induced seizure shortens PGES duration.However the specific network and receptor mechanisms underlying PGES are unknown. Our objective is toidentify a DRN network and 5-HT receptor mechanism that could be manipulated to reduce PGES and preventSUDEP. A potential downstream target is the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) a pontine regioninvolved in sleep-wake regulation attention EEG regulation and arousal. Seizure-induced dysregulation of 5-HT signaling may interfere with subcortical arousal networks such as those involving the PPT and producePGES. In Aim 1 to determine a role for a DRN  PPT circuit in PGES we will optogenetically stimulate andinhibit DRN 5-HT terminals in the PPT prior to seizures induced by amygdala stimulation in amygdala kindledmice during wake/NREM/REM and observe changes in PGES duration. Several 5-HT receptors have beenimplicated in SUDEP and may be found on cholinergic neurons in the PPT. In Aim 2 we will utilizeimmunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs RNAscope fluorescent in situhybridization and immunohistochemistry to determine the identity of PPT neurons and 5-HT receptorscontacted by DRN 5-HT terminals. Then we will administer intracranial 5-HT antagonists into the PPT with orwithout a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitory onboard induce an amygdala-kindled seizure and observeeffects on PGES. Participation in the proposed training plan and completion of the proposed experiments willadvance the applicants neuroscience training. It will also elucidate the DRN-PPT circuit and determine its rolein PGES. By manipulating 5-HT circuitry we may discover ways to eliminate PGES and consequentiallyprevent death in high risk epilepsy patients.","Acute;Affect;American;Amygdaloid structure;Animals;Arousal;Attention;Brain;Brain region;Breathing;Cause of Death;Cell Nucleus;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Consequentialism;Data;Depressed mood;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Etiology;FDA approved;Familiarity;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Freedom;Functional disorder;Gene Delivery;Goals;HTR2A gene;Immunohistochemistry;Impairment;Injections;Intractable Epilepsy;Investigation;Knowledge;Life;Mediating;Midbrain structure;Mus;Neurons;Neurosciences;Organ;Patients;Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pontine structure;Public Health;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Technics;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Marker;Role;Seizures;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor;Serotonin;Serotonin Antagonists;Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2A;Signal Transduction;Sleep;Solvents;Source;Stroke;Stupor;System;Testing;Three-Dimensional Imaging;Training;Viral;Wakefulness;cholinergic neuron;conventional therapy;dorsal raphe nucleus;expectation;experience;experimental study;high risk;mortality;nervous system disorder;neurotransmission;non rapid eye movement;optogenetics;prevent;receptor;response;reuptake;serotonin receptor;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy","Serotonergic network mechanisms in postictal generalized EEG suppression","Project NarrativeSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractoryepilepsy but we do not its exact cause and thus cannot predict or prevent it effectively.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Dementia; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","AbstractCognitive symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD) can affect up to 80% of PD patients and lead toenormous societal cost. These symptoms involve impaired executive functions such as working memoryattention behavioral flexibility and timing and can progress to psychosis hallucinations and dementia.There are few therapies that improve cognitive function in PD. Thus there is a critical need to betterunderstand the fundamental mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction that occurs in PD. Our long-term goalis to elucidate the mechanisms by which cognitive dysfunction occurs in PD patients in order to developnew targeted treatments.PD involves death of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in ventral tegmental area (VTA). These neuronssend mesocortical projections to key cognitive cortical areas such as the prefrontal cortex. It is unknownhow VTA dopamine neurons are involved in cognitive processes that malfunction in human PD patients.Our goal in this proposal is to harness cell-type specific rodent models to characterize VTA dopamineneuronal function in cognitive processes relevant to PD. Our preliminary data demonstrates interval-timing variability correlates with PD-related cognitive dysfunction. Our rodent research demonstrates thatVTA dopamine is necessary for interval timing prefrontal timing-related modulations and prefrontal 4 Hzrhythms. Here we will combine optogenetics fiber photometry and neuronal ensemble recordings intransgenic mice to interrogate VTA dopamine projections with cell-type-specificity and millisecondresolution. We will test the overall hypothesis that VTA dopamine neurons engage cognitive processingin the prefrontal cortex. In Aim 1 we will determine how silencing VTA dopamine neurons impactscognitive processing. In Aim 2 we will define how VTA dopamine neuron dynamics predict cognitiveprocessing. In Aim 3 we will determine how stimulating VTA dopamine neurons impacts cognitiveprocessing.This proposal is broadly significant in determining when and how VTA dopamine engages prefrontalcognitive processing. Although this is a basic-science proposal focused on VTA dopamine neurons ourresults will guide new therapies for human PD.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTInvestigators at the University of Iowa have a growing need to analyze macromolecular interactions andconformational dynamics at a single-molecule level. For over a decade University of Iowa Carver Collegeof Medicine Protein and Crystallography (P&C) Facility has been providing the University of Iowainvestigators access to and help in operating of basic and state-of-the-art instrumentation for biophysicaland structural analysis of proteins and nucleic acids. Addition of an instrument that will allow researchersto visualize and study biologically important molecules individually in real time and under physiologicalconditions will significantly enhance research programs at the University of Iowa. It will provide a much-needed tool for developing mechanistic understanding of how cells work and communicate howmolecular machines assemble and function. While several groups at the University of Iowa have builtsystems for single-molecule analysis in their labs none of these instruments allows for simultaneousvisualization and manipulation of biological macromolecules. Currently there is also no single-moleculeinstruments centrally available to non-expert users at the University of Iowa.This proposal requests funds for a LUMICKS C-Trap(R) instrument the first and only commercialinstrument for single-molecule analysis of macromolecular interactions that combines high resolutionoptical tweezers fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics and therefore allows simultaneousmanipulation and visualization of the macromolecular complexes.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTInvestigators at the University of Iowa have a growing need to analyze macromolecular interactions andconformational dynamics at a single-molecule level. For over a decade University of Iowa Carver Collegeof Medicine Protein and Crystallography (P&C) Facility has been providing the University of Iowainvestigators access to and help in operating of basic and state-of-the-art instrumentation for biophysicaland structural analysis of proteins and nucleic acids. Addition of an instrument that will allow researchersto visualize and study biologically important molecules individually in real time and under physiologicalconditions will significantly enhance research programs at the University of Iowa. It will provide a much-needed tool for developing mechanistic understanding of how cells work and communicate howmolecular machines assemble and function. While several groups at the University of Iowa have builtsystems for single-molecule analysis in their labs none of these instruments allows for simultaneousvisualization and manipulation of biological macromolecules. Currently there is also no single-moleculeinstruments centrally available to non-expert users at the University of Iowa.This proposal requests funds for a LUMICKS C-Trap(R) instrument the first and only commercialinstrument for single-molecule analysis of macromolecular interactions that combines high resolutionoptical tweezers fluorescence microscopy and microfluidics and therefore allows simultaneousmanipulation and visualization of the macromolecular complexes. It is an important tool for the single-molecule multiparameter analysis of macromolecular interactions assembly and function of molecularmachines and conformational dynamics of proteins and nucleic acids.The C-Trap(R) will be housed at the P&C Facility whose personnel will be responsible for the instrumentmaintenance user training and will assist the investigators with experimental design instrumentoperation and data analysis.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Mental Health; Mind and Body; Neurosciences; Women's Health","Project Summary/AbstractSignificant work demonstrates the influence of spouses on one anothers emotions behaviors and health-related outcomes. What is not understood is the role partners play in cognitive development change andadaptation in middle and later life. Because researchers have not identified the biobehavioral mechanisms andprocesses that couples employ as they navigate normative and non-normative (i.e. mild cognitive impairmentdementia) cognitive aging development of effective behavioral interventions to maintain and bolsterperformance is impeded. Prospective memory (PM) or memory for future actions is essential to health andsafety (e.g. remembering to take medication or turn off a stove) and ultimately the ability to age in place. Toremain in their homes older adults must maintain this critical memory skill. The proposed research will identifybehaviors of middle-aged and older adults when they collaborate on PM tasks and determine how thosebehaviors and the accompanying stress response affect PM. The central hypothesis underlying this research isthat significant others are inherently involved in daily memory tasks and exert substantial partner effectswhich positively (e.g. compensation) and/or negatively (e.g. retrieval interference increased stress) influencePM outcomes. To test the hypothesis this research addresses four specific aims: 1) Determine the effects ofindividual and dyadic characteristics on collaborative PM performance in laboratory and real-world contexts 2)Investigate social and cognitive behaviors exhibited during the collaborative process to determine the impact ofdyadic behaviors on PM performance 3) Identify the concomitant effects of partners stress responses andability on collaborative PM performance and 4) Investigate biobehavioral processes and correspondingperformance within a clinical subsample of dyads for whom one partner has MCI or early-stage dementia. Theresearch is significant because it systematically examines the commonplace (but unstudied) phenomenon ofpartner interactions to identify the socio-cognitive and physiological processes important to PM and how thesebiobehavioral pathways may differ for couples experiencing non-normative cognitive change. The work isinnovative because it includes measurement of dyadic attunement and incorporates investigation of spouseswho experience cognitive change at different rates and thus are faced with the need to compensate for apartner who is struggling with the cognitive tasks of daily life. The proposed research is essential to achievingour goal of developing behaviorally-based interventions to enhance critical everyday memory behaviors andpromote independent living.","Address;Adult;Affect;Autonomic nervous system;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Belief;Biological Markers;Characteristics;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive aging;Complex;Couples;Data;Dementia;Development;Diagnosis;Ecological momentary assessment;Elderly;Emotions;Environment;Exhibits;Failure;Financial compensation;Future;Goals;Health;Home;Hydrocortisone;Independent Living;Individual;Influentials;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Laboratories;Life;Measurement;Measures;Memory;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Perception;Performance;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Play;Process;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Retrieval;Role;Safety;Salivary;Social Processes;Source;Spouses;Stress;System;Testing;Work;age difference;aging in place;base;behavioral response;biobehavior;biological adaptation to stress;clinical practice;cognitive ability;cognitive change;cognitive development;cognitive performance;cognitive task;experience;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis;indexing;innovation;middle age;mild cognitive impairment;prospective memory;resilience;skills;social;success;therapy development;tutoring","The Role of Spousal Biobehavioral Co-regulation in Everyday Collaborative Memory: Identifying Targets for Intervention","Project NarrativeSuccessful memory for future actions is essential to adults capacity to engage in health and safety-relatedactivities (e.g. remembering to take medication).

"Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Lung; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human","1 Project Summary 2 Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disorder in Caucasian populations and is 3 caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. CF is a multi-organ 4 disease affecting the lung pancreas liver intestine and gallbladder. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is 5 the most common severe complication of CF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. CFRD 6 which is pathophysiologically distinct from type 1 and type 2 diabetes significantly worsens the nutritional and 7 pulmonary health of CF patients. Our studies in CF ferrets and children 3 months to 6 years of age suggest that 8 the underpinnings of CFRD occur very early in life when acinar cells are lost and inflammatory/fibrotic remodeling 9 occurs. In CF ferrets this exocrine-driven pancreatic remodeling leads to a glycemic crisis caused by b-cell loss10 and/or dysfunction. Interestingly the emergence of newly formed b-cells in CF ferrets coincides with a transient11 recovery in glycemic control. Nonetheless those CF ferrets with the greatest early-life glycemic disturbances go12 on to develop CFRD later in life. We have also reported that a similar pattern of glycemic disturbance and13 recovery occurs in young CF children. Our central hypothesis proposes that new b-cells in the CF ferret pancreas14 are derived from exocrine progenitors and/or committed dedifferentiated b-cells. Three lineage tracing ferret15 models will be used to fate map b-cell progenitors (INS-IRES-CreERT2) ductal-derived endocrine progenitors16 (KRT7-IRES-CreERT2) and acinar-derived endocrine progenitors (PTF1A-IRES-CreERT2). The use of an additional17 CFTRG551D ferret model which affords temporal control of pancreatic disease onset using the CFTR modulator18 VX-770 will allow for dissection of how the developmental timing of pancreatitis impact progenitor cell states19 and longer-term progression of CFRD. Our in vivo and in vitro preliminary data also show that CF ferret ductal20 cells acquire properties consistent with the transcriptional and epigenetic states found in pancreatic progenitors21 during development. The mechanisms of this alteration will be investigated by using in vitro models and the study22 of pancreatic progenitor cell specification during in utero development of the CF ferret pancreas. The proposed23 research has brought together two institutions with expertise in animal modeling of CF pancreatic disease24 lineage-tracing of islet endocrine precursors and integrated physiology of CFRD to delineate the mechanism of25 islet resurgence in CF using the first ever non-rodent lineage-tracing models. These studies are expected to26 identify mechanisms not only relevant to CFRD but also other forms of pancreatogenic diabetes.","6 year old;ATAC-seq;Acinar Cell;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Age;Animal Model;B-Lymphocytes;Biology;Birth;Caucasians;Cells;Characteristics;Child;Chloride Channels;Chromatin;Complication;Cystic Fibrosis;Data;Defect;Development;Developmental Biology;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Dissection;Duct (organ) structure;Ductal Epithelial Cell;Ductal Epithelium;Endocrine;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;Event;Exocrine pancreas;Ferrets;Fibrocystic Disease of Pancreas;Functional disorder;Gallbladder;Genetic Engineering;Genetic Transcription;Glucose;Goals;Health;Hormones;Human;Hyperglycemia;In Vitro;Inflammatory;Injury;Institution;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Internal Ribosome Entry Site;Intestines;Knowledge;Life;Link;Liver;Lung;Maintenance;Maps;Mediating;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Natural regeneration;Neonatal;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Nutritional;Onset of illness;Outcome;Pancreas;Pancreatic Diseases;Pancreatic Injury;Pancreatic duct;Pancreatitis;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacology;Phase;Phenotype;Physiology;Population;Prevention strategy;Preventive treatment;Process;Property;Recovery;Reporter;Reporting;Research;Resources;Severities;Source;TGFB1 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;VX-770;Withdrawal;age related;base;clinical care;comorbidity;cystic fibrosis patients;cystic fibrosis related diabetes;developmental disease;endocrine pancreas development;fetal;genetic manipulation;glycemic control;in utero;in vitro Model;in vivo;insulin secretion;islet;islet stem cells;mortality;novel;postnatal;postnatal period;progenitor;programs;pulmonary function;stem cells;tool;transcriptome sequencing","Early Pathogenesis of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes","Project NarrativeCystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive condition among Caucasians withover $450 million dollars spent annually on clinical care of CF patients in the U.S. alone.

"Cachexia; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Digestive Diseases; Pancreatic Cancer; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYCachexia is a multi-factorial syndrome accompanying cancer with the most notable symptom being unintentionalweight loss due to a depletion of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue mass. Cachexia affects approximately 50%of all cancer patients and nearly all patients with advanced disease. While it is difficult to quantify the number ofpatient deaths that result directly from cachexia it is clear that cancer cachexia is a significant contributor tonegative outcomes of cancer patients. This is particularly true for patients with gastrointestinal cancers such aspancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients have both the highest incidenceand severity of disease-associated weight loss.Published data including our own have consistently shown that male and female PDAC patients have similarincidence and severity of cachexia. However our preliminary data suggest that while relative weight loss maybe equivalent between males and females there is a striking difference between these two groups. Whilecachectic males appear to lose skeletal muscle mass in proportion to their total body weight losses cachecticfemales may instead lose weight primarily due to adipose tissue loss. Furthermore we hypothesize that malesand females respond differently to anti-cachexia treatment including ghrelin receptor antagonization. Thisproposal seeks to test our hypothesis of a sexual dimorphism in cancer cachexia and response to anti-cachexiatreatment using a combination of retrospective clinical analyses and mouse modeling.Completing the proposed research will have a significant impact on our understanding of sexual dimorphisms incancer cachexia and response to anti-cachexia treatment. If our hypothesis is correct our findings would alterhow anti-cachexia clinical trials are designed and how future therapeutics are used clinically.","Adipose tissue;Affect;Agonist;Anticachexia Agent;Body Composition;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Cachexia;Cancer Patient;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Data;Female;Future;Image;Incidence;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Morbidity - disease rate;Muscle;Outcome;Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Pharmacology;Phase III Clinical Trials;Placebos;Publishing;Radiation therapy;Research;Severities;Severity of illness;Sex Differences;Skeletal Muscle;Symptoms;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Uses;Thinness;Time;Tissues;Weight;Weight Gain;X-Ray Computed Tomography;advanced disease;base;cancer cachexia;cancer diagnosis;cohort;design;ghrelin receptor;lean body mass;male;mortality;mouse model;muscle form;reduced muscle mass;response;restoration;sex;sexual dimorphism;surgery outcome;targeted agent;wasting","Sex-dependent rescue of cancer cachexia","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe severe weight loss of pancreatic cancer-induced cachexia due to muscle and adipose tissue wasting is asignificant contributor to patient morbidity and mortality.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Rare Diseases","The cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A (Nav1.5) and the inward depolarizing Na+ current (INa) play a critical rolein regulating the action potential of myocytes in the atrium ventricle and specialized conduction system.Mutations in SCN5A are associated with several arrhythmia phenotypes including long QT syndromeBrugada syndrome and dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition loss of Na+ channel function is observed duringheart failure leading to conduction slowing and ventricular arrhythmias based on re-entrant mechanisms. Small Ubiquitin-like Modifiers (SUMOs) post-translationally modify lysine residues on proteins. Decreasein SUMOylation of cardiac calcium-handling proteins is associated with human heart failure. The significanceof SUMOylation in regulating cardiac electrical activity is not known. Our preliminary data identifies apolymorphism in the SUMO1 gene that associates with appropriate defibrillator shocks in patients with heartfailure suggesting that SUMO1 modifies arrhythmia risk. Given our prior work demonstrating that acetylationof SCN5A on a lysine residue decreases cardiac sodium current we now hypothesize that in addition toacetylation SCN5A is post-translationally modified by SUMOylation and SUMO-SCN5A is vital for the cardiacNa+ current and for normal electrical activity in the heart. This hypothesis is based on very novel preliminarydata that SUMO1 modifies SCN5A and stimulates the Na+ current whereas de-SUMOylation inhibits INa andprecipitates cardiac arrhythmias in vivo. This application will explore in-depth the role of SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation on the cardiac Na+current  characterizing their effect on channels properties expression ubiquitination acetylation traffickingand interaction with its known partner Sirtuin1. The proposal will identify the lysine residues in SCN5A that areSUMOylated and explore the importance of SUMOylation of these lysines on the cardiac Na+ current. It willdevelop and use state-of-the-art biological reagents including a novel non-SUMOylatable Nav1.5 knockinmouse cardiotropic viral vectors to SUMOylate and de-SUMOylate Nav1.5 in vivo and transgenic miceoverexpressing SUMO proteins. It will leverage the expertise of basic and mouse electrophysiologistsmolecular biologists and experts in cardiac SUMOylation. Using these reagents and with the collectiveexpertise of the investigative team it will determine if SCN5A SUMOylation is altered in heart failure and ifcardiac SUMOylation modifies arrhythmic risk in failing and non-failing hearts. SUMO modification of SCN5A will identify a new mechanism for regulation of cardiac INa and one that haspotential clinical relevance in patients with heart failure. In doing so it will open the door for using SUMOproteins as therapeutic agents in patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.","Acetylation;Action Potentials;Amino Acids;Arginine;Arrhythmia;Biological;Brugada syndrome;CRISPR/Cas technology;Calcium;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiomyopathies;Data;Deacetylase;Defibrillators;Dilated Cardiomyopathy;Dimerization;Disease;Down-Regulation;Electric Stimulation;Electrocardiogram;Enzymes;Funding;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Polymorphism;Heart;Heart Atrium;Heart failure;Human;Implantable Defibrillators;Inherited;Ion Channel;Knock-in;Knock-in Mouse;Life;Ligase;Light;Long QT Syndrome;Lysine;Mediating;Membrane;Modification;Molecular;Mus;Muscle Cells;Mutate;Mutation;Myocardium;Neonatal;Neurons;Optics;Patients;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Physiological;Play;Potassium Channel;Predisposition;Property;Proteins;Rattus;Reagent;Regulation;Research;Risk;Role;SUMO1 gene;Secondary to;Seizures;Shock;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Sodium;Sodium Channel;Sudden Death;Sumoylation Pathway;Syndrome;System;Telemetry;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Transgenic Mice;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Ventricular Arrhythmia;Viral Vector;Work;base;clinically relevant;clinically significant;cohort;constriction;design;heart electrical activity;heart rhythm;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;loss of function;novel;overexpression;sudden cardiac death;tool;trafficking;ubiquitin ligase;voltage","Regulation of the Cardiac Sodium Channel by Sumoylation","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis project will determine if modification of a cardiac ion channel that conducts sodium by asmall protein (called SUMO) is required for normal electrical activity in normal and failing hearts.This sodium channel in heart muscle is vital for normal propagation of electrical activity in theheart and malfunctions in heart failure and some genetic diseases that cause sudden cardiacdeath.

"Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Congenital Heart Disease; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Depression; Heart Disease; Maternal Health; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Serious Mental Illness; Women's Health","ABSTRACTThe broad goal of this translational study is to determine if maternal depression treatment affectsventricular development through comprehensive echocardiography measurements immediately afterbirth and over time. The decision to medically treat maternal depression is challenging and includescareful consideration of the risks versus benefits. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are aclass of antidepressants currently prescribed to 10-13% of pregnant women. Interpersonalpsychotherapy (IPT) is an alternative non-pharmacologic treatment that has shown efficacy in mild tosevere depression. Treatment of maternal depression is not only critical for the health of the motherand fetus but may impact overall health as research has shown that a deleterious intrauterineenvironment can predispose individuals to cardiovascular disease. To date we have demonstratedboth short- and long-term effects from SSRI exposure on ventricular size and cardiac function in miceand zebrafish where maternal depression is eliminated as a contributing factor. Epidemiologic reportscontinue to be conflicting if SSRIs influence cardiac development and maternal depression remains aconfounding factor. Thus it is critical to determine if these ventricular findings after SSRI exposure inanimal models translate to humans and if similar findings are noted with non-pharmacologic treatmentfor maternal depression. To address these issues a collaborative team of experts in pediatrics(neonatal hemodynamics cardiology and cardiac critical care) and psychiatry will recruit motherswithout depression and with maternal depression treated with SSRIs or IPT and their offspring. We willapply advanced echocardiography techniques which have been validated in the newborn and pediatricpopulations to pursue two specific aims: (1) Measure the impact of maternal depression and itstreatment on offspring ventricular size immediately after birth at 1 week and at 1 year of age; and (2)Quantify the impact of maternal depression and its treatment on offspring ventricular function followingbirth at 1 week and at 1 year of age. Because heart size and ventricular function are importantpredictors of outcomes in many adult and pediatric diseases this study will provide important answersto a timely highly-relevant clinical question.","1 year old;Address;Adult;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Antidepressive Agents;Birth;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiac development;Cardiology;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Childhood;Conflict (Psychology);Congenital Heart Defects;Critical Care;Data;Depressed mood;Development;Dimensions;Disease;Echocardiography;Epidemiology;Exposure to;Fetal Development;Fetus;Frequencies;Future;Genetic;Gestational Age;Goals;Growth;Health;Human;Imaging Techniques;Impairment;Individual;Infant;Investigation;Knowledge;Left;Long-Term Effects;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Mental Depression;Monitor;Mothers;Mus;Myocardial;Neonatal;Newborn Infant;Nonpharmacologic Therapy;Outcome;Pediatrics;Performance;Persistent Fetal Circulation Syndrome;Pharmacological Treatment;Pharmacology;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Predictive Value;Pregnant Women;Prospective Studies;Psychiatry;Public Health;Recommendation;Reporting;Research;Research Design;Risk;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor;Serotonin;Sertraline;Signal Transduction;Structure;Techniques;Time;Translating;United States;Ventricular;Ventricular Function;Woman;Work;Zebrafish;antepartum depression;bench to bedside;cardiogenesis;cardiovascular health;clinically relevant;expectation;fetal;health of the mother;heart dimension/size;heart function;hemodynamics;indexing;infancy;innovation;insight;interpersonal therapy;intrauterine environment;maternal depression;offspring;outcome prediction;perinatal mental health;peripartum depression;policy implication;postnatal;prenatal exposure;recruit;translational study;treatment risk","SSRI Exposure and Ventricular Development from Bench to Bedside: A Prospective Study to Determine if Maternal Depression Treatment Impacts Offspring Cardiac Development","RELEVANCEDepressions during pregnancy affects nearly 20% of women and 10% of pregnant women are taking selectiveserotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/AbstractSpatio-temporal regulation of exocytosis is essential for establishing and maintaining intercellular junctions andsurface polarity properties vital to epithelial tissues. Failure to accurately deliver and maintain correct levels ofmembrane proteins at appropriate sites is a common feature of human metabolic diseases and cancers.Despite progress in understanding mechanisms of protein sorting trafficking and turnover major questionspersist about these processes. The long-term goal of our research is to understand how environmental cuessignal to the cytoskeleton and transport machinery to organize trafficking pathways in epithelial cells. Thefocus of our research is on the exocyst a multi-functional scaffold and Ral GTPases which regulate exocystactivities. Based upon results of our previous work we have developed a working hypothesis. We proposethat RalA and RalB are coordinately regulated by cell-cell adhesion and that they control distinct stages ofexocyst-dependent membrane trafficking in both the exocytic and endocytic pathways by controlling theassociation between the scaffold and additional proteins. We have identified two such proteins. Munc18c aregulator of vesicle fusion binds the exocyst in a RalA-dependent manner and this interaction is required forbasolateral exocytosis. USP9X a deubiquitinase engages the exocyst in a RalB-dependent manner andstabilizes proteins in the plasma membrane during intercellular junction assembly. Therefore we propose thatcoordinated regulation of a common effector complex (exocyst) by two related GTPases (RalA and RalB)provides a key molecular link between an environmental cue (cell-cell adhesion) and biogenesis of epithelialcell specific structures. The overall objective of this proposal is to dissect molecular mechanisms by which RalGTPases and exocyst complexes control the formation of intercellular junctions and polarized membranedomains in epithelial cells. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to identify mechanisms by which E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion regulates Ral GTPase activities; 2) to determine how RalA engages exocystcomplexes to facilitate basolateral exocytosis; and 3) to define how RalB engages the exocyst to regulateendocytosis of components of apical junctional complexes. Collectively the studies we propose here seek touncover important details of a mechanism that links cell-cell adhesion to activation of a signaling pathway thatpromotes polarized membrane trafficking and selective protein stabilization during establishment of epithelialpolarity. Given that the molecules on which we will focus are conserved across metazoans we believe thatstudying how they collaborate to establish and maintain epithelial structures will provide important insights intomechanisms that regulate assembly of plasma membrane protein complexes in many other cell types andorganisms. Moreover because Ral GTPases and exocyst components are involved in many cancersmetabolic disorders and diabetes the significance of this work is that it will guide our thinking about newtherapies for human diseases in which these factors are disrupted.","Adhesions;Apical;Binding;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;Cadherins;Cell Adhesion;Cell Polarity;Cell membrane;Cell surface;Cell-Cell Adhesion;Cells;Cilia;Complex;Cues;Cytoskeleton;Deubiquitinating Enzyme;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;E-Cadherin;Endocytosis;Ensure;Environment;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Equilibrium;Event;Exocytosis;Failure;Genetic Epistasis;Goals;Gold;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Hepatolenticular Degeneration;Human;Intercellular Junctions;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Link;Liquid substance;MDCK cell;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Menkes Kinky Hair Syndrome;Metabolic Diseases;Molecular;Munc18c protein;Mutation;Neurons;Nutrient;Organism;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Polycystic Kidney Diseases;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Property;Protein Sortings;Proteins;Proximal Kidney Tubules;Regulation;Regulation of Exocytosis;Research;Secretory Vesicles;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Structure;Study models;Surface;Testing;Thinking;Tissues;Ubiquitination;Vesicle;Work;base;basolateral membrane;cell type;genetic approach;human disease;insight;novel therapeutics;operation;polarized cell;preference;protein complex;protein transport;quantitative imaging;ral A GTP-Binding Protein;scaffold;spatiotemporal;syntaxin 4;target SNARE proteins;trafficking;vesicle transport","Regulation of Epithelial Cell Polarity by Ral-Exocyst Complexes","Project NarrativeEpithelial tissues provide barriers between the inside of our bodies and the environment and protect us fromharmful agents that cause disease and loss of essential bodily fluids and nutrients.

"Biomedical Imaging","Project Summary Limitations in current statistical analysis methodology for radiologic diagnostic imaging studies greatlyrestrict a researcher's choices of study designs and types of analyses. Therefore there is a critical need to cre-ate a more encompassing multi-reader diagnostic-study analysis methodology that does not limit the ability ofresearchers to answer research questions because of strict study-design constraints and few analysis options. Our long-term goal is to develop statistical methodology and software appropriate for diagnostic radio-logical imaging studies that accounts for both patient and reader variability. Our objective here is to further de-velop Obuchowski-Rockette (OR) methodology (and related Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz) software in a way thatallows for many more types of analyses and study designs. Specifically we will pursue four specific aims: (1)Develop a generalized OR methodology that accommodates the same types of designs and analysis modelsthat can currently be used with conventional analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) and linear regression methodology.(2) Provide illustrative examples showing how the generalized OR methodology can be applied to situationswhere the present OR methodology is not applicable. These include unbalanced designs regression analysesmultivariate analyses ANCOVA analyses partially-paired-reader data and missing-cases data. (3) Empiricallyvalidate the OR methodology for each example in Aim 2 through simulations. (4) Develop R MATLAB andSAS software code for implementing the generalized OR methodology. Expected outcomes include a generalized OR methodology that has the same analysis and design op-tions as conventional linear regression and ANOVA methodology in contrast to present OR methodology. Themethodology will apply to any type of reader performance outcome including ROC FROC region-of-interest(ROI) and location ROC (LROC) with conclusions generalizing to both cases and readers. Other expectedoutcomes include illustrative examples of applications of the methodology that were not previously possible RMATLAB and SAS code for implementing the methodology and a thorough validation of the methodology. This research is significant because it will liberate the diagnostic-radiology researcher from the strictanalysis and design limitations of the present methodology thus enhancing the researcher's ability to assessthe usefulness of imaging modalities and the effects of reader and case attributes on reader performance in anefficient and meaningful manner. It will be innovative because it will enable new NIH-pertinent horizons thatpresently are unattainable because of limited analysis methodology. Presently researchers in diagnostic radi-ology are greatly constrained in the research questions that they can investigate by the stringent limitations ofthe OR (and related DBM) analysis methods. The proposed methodology by expanding the scope of analyseswill greatly expand the possible scope of diagnostic radiology research questions that can be investigated.","Accounting;Analysis of Covariance;Analysis of Variance;Biomedical Technology;Code;Computer software;Confounding Factors (Epidemiology);Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic radiologic examination;Goals;Health;Linear Regressions;Location;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modality;Modeling;Multivariate Analysis;National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Play;Population;Radiation Dose Unit;Reader;Reading;Receiver Operating Characteristics;Regression Analysis;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Role;Statistical Data Interpretation;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Validation;design;experience;imaging modality;imaging study;improved;innovation;interest;models and simulation;radiologist;response;simulation","Generalized Obuchowski-Rockette Methodology for Analysis of Radiologic Diagnostic Imaging Studies","PROJECT NARRATIVEBy providing a generalized Obuchowski-Rockette methodology for analyzing data from diagnostic imagingstudies the proposed research will result in research questions being more fully and efficiently answered.Thus the proposed research is relevant to the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging andBioengineering namely to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application ofbiomedical technologies.","NIBIB","10172897","5/7/2021","PA-16-160","5R01EB025174-04","5","R01","EB","025174","04","","DUAN, QI ","9/1/2018","5/31/2023","Biomedical Imaging Technology B Study Section[BMIT-B]"," ","10570764","HILLIS, STEPHEN LAWRENCE","Not Applicable","01","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2021","5/31/2023"," ","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","494355"," ","NIBIB","324168","170187"," ","494355",
"Biodefense; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Nanotechnology; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related","Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of serious respiratory illness and has been responsible for significantmorbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. The virus leads to approximately 200000 hospitalizations and upto 36000 deaths annually in the United States during non-pandemic years. Given the disease severity theassociated economic costs and the recent appearance of novel IAV strains within the US there has been arenewed interest in developing novel and efficacious universal influenza vaccination strategies to combat thissignificant global public health threat. Importantly recent studies have highlighted the fact that immunizationsthat generate local (i.e. nasal mucosa and lung) tissue-resident memory T and B memory cells in addition tosystemic immunity offer the greatest protection against future IAV encounters. The currently approved IAV-vaccines are designed to largely induce IAV-specific antibodies and by their design do not induce lungresident memory T and B cells that occur during natural IAV infections. Thus our long-term goal is to develop aprotective vaccine against IAV that induces lung resident T and B cells without the toxicity that occurs withnatural infection. To this end we have recently developed a nanoparticle based IAV vaccine (IAV-nanovax) thatmimics without the pathology associated with IAV infections many of the key attributes thought to beimportant for lung resident T and B cell induction and maintenance. Importantly this IAV nanoparticle vaccinebreaks the cold chain is needle free and is biocompatible. This IAV-nanovax has shown promising efficacy inprotection against homologous and heterologous IAV infections and the ability to induce T cell and B cellresponses in the lungs in our preliminary studies. Therefore this proposal will use the combined expertise ofthe Co-PIs and Co-Investigators to determine if a nanoparticle-based approach will allow for the induction ofdurable IAV-specific lung-resident T and B cell responses and therein provide robust protection againsthomologous and heterologous IAV strains using the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the vaccineformulation that induces optimal immunity and protection against homologous and heterologous viruschallenges 2) Determine the vaccine formulation that induces optimal protection against virus challenge inoutbred populations. At the end of the project we will have extended our findings into translationally relevantoutbred populations established protective immune correlates that can be used to assess the efficacy of futurevaccination strategies and delivered a protective preclinical nanovaccine.","Animals;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigens;Appearance;B-Lymphocytes;Birds;Cessation of life;Cold Chains;Data;Development;Economics;Epidemic;Exhibits;Future;Generations;Goals;Hospitalization;Human;Humoral Immunities;Immune;Immunity;Immunization;Infection;Influenza A Virus H1N1 Subtype;Influenza A Virus H5N1 Subtype;Influenza A Virus H5N2 Subtype;Influenza A virus;Influenza vaccination;Longevity;Lung;Maintenance;Mediating;Medical Care Costs;Memory;Memory B-Lymphocyte;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Needles;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathology;Population;Productivity;Public Health;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Severity of illness;Structure of mucous membrane of nose;Structure of parenchyma of lung;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Tissues;Toxic effect;United States;Vaccination;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Variant;Virus;Virus Diseases;base;biomaterial compatibility;combat;cytotoxic CD8 T cells;design;economic cost;experience;flu;influenza virus strain;influenza virus vaccine;influenzavirus;innovation;interest;mortality;nanoparticle;nanovaccine;neutralizing antibody;nonhuman primate;novel;pandemic disease;pre-clinical;respiratory;response;tertiary lymphoid organ;universal vaccine;vaccination strategy;vaccine development","Nanovaccine-Mediated Immune Protection Against Influenza Virus","Recent studies have highlighted the fact that immunizations capable of generating local (i.e. nasal mucosa andlung) tissue-resident memory T and B cells in addition to systemic immunity offer the greatest protectionagainst future influenza A virus (IAV) encounters.

"Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Pediatric; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARYWork from our laboratory discovered that mild physiological and environmental challenges encountered earlierin adulthood produce sustained sensitization of the hypertensive response to subsequent hypertensinogenicchallenges. Our recent studies indicate that the adult male offspring of dams with angiotensin II-producedgestational hypertension or eating a high-fat diet during the perinatal period also display sensitization of thehypertensive response. Accompanying this exacerbation of the hypertensive response is increased expressionof components of the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system proinflammatory cytokines and activation ofmicroglia in forebrain structures controlling sympathetic tone and blood pressure. Importantly we find thatadministering a converting enzyme inhibitor to the sensitized offspring for six weeks between weaning and earlyadulthood abrogates gestational hypertension-induced sensitization of the hypertensive response. The presentproposal builds on these findings with experiments that will determine: 1) the critical perinatal period when thehypertensive response can be sensitized by maternal gestational hypertension 2) if maternal gestationalhypertension alters mother-offspring behaviors to induce hypertensive response sensitization 3) whetherinhibitors of microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokines and other blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system will reverse the sensitizing effects of maternal gestational hypertension and maternalperinatal high-fat diet intake 4) why young females are protected against hypertensive response sensitization5) if maternal gestational hypertension or high-fat diet intake induces sensitized responses to identifiedhypertension risk factors related to dietary obesity sodium intake and what factors are responsible of maintaininga sensitized response. This information will be obtained by using telemetry to measure blood pressure in freelymoving rats and pharmacological methods to test mechanisms mediating hypertensive response sensitization.In addition molecular expression methods be used to characterize changes in mRNA and protein expression inkey CNS regions controlling blood pressure. Completion of the proposed experiments will result in the deliveryof important new information on how fetal programming results in increasing the likelihood of expression ofenhanced hypertension later in life and measures that can be used to prevent it.","Address;Adult;Angiotensin II;Angiotensins;Behavior;Behavioral;Blood Pressure;Brain;Cytokine Activation;Dietary Factors;Disease;Eating;Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs;Etiology;Exposure to;Female;Fetus;High Fat Diet;Hypertension;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Intake;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratories;Learning;Life;Literature;Measures;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Memory;Methods;Microglia;Modeling;Molecular;Mothers;Nervous system structure;Neuraxis;Neuronal Plasticity;Obesity;Pathogenesis;Perinatal;Pharmacology;Physiological;Pregnant Women;Process;Prosencephalon;Rattus;Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Sodium;Sodium Chloride;Stimulus;Stress;Structure;Sympathetic Nervous System;Telemetry;Testing;Time;Weaning;Work;behavioral response;blood pressure regulation;brain pathway;critical period;cytokine;dietary;emerging adult;experience;experimental study;fetal;fetal programming;in utero;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;mRNA Expression;male;mature animal;neonate;neural network;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;offspring;perinatal period;pregnancy hypertension;prevent;programs;protein expression;response;stressor;young adult","Mechanisms of hypertensive response sensitization and perinatal programming of hypertension","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe response to hypertension-eliciting stimuli is sensitized by prior exposure to mild stressors.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Tuberculosis","Natural products have a proven record of providing a significant fraction either directly or as leadcompounds of human medicines. Among natural products the terpenoids (isoprenoids) stand out asbeing the largest class (>50000 already known) with the 20-carbon diterpenoids targeted here forming asignificant fraction of these (>12000 known). The extensive diversification of diterpenoids indicates thatthe manifold hydrocarbon skeletons that can be formed from this C20 backbone particularly the decalincore ring structure found in the labdane-related diterpenoids (>7000 known) provide privileged scaffoldsfor derivation of biological activity. Indeed a number of these labdane-related diterpenoids are used aspharmaceuticals (e.g. the antibiotic mutilins) or are being investigated for such use (e.g. thetanshinones triptolide andrographolide etc.). In addition we have contributed to the discovery that thehuman pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis utilizes labdane-related diterpenoid metabolism inconstruction of an immune-modulatory factor. Accordingly we propose here to continue our productivestudies of the biosynthetic enzymes required to produce bioactive diterpenoids. Specifically we will buildon our previous work in this area which includes investigations of enzymatic structure-function that haveprovided novel biosynthetic access to an array of diterpenoids as well as elucidation of strategicallyselected diterpenoid metabolic networks.

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Biotechnology; Neurosciences","The University of Iowa is requesting funds to acquire the GE Extreme Slewrate Performance (ESP) 3Thead-only scanner. The ESP scanner provides high end gradient performance (Amplitude=115 mT/m andSlewrate=700T/m/s) which will offer significant improvements for diffusion imaging. The high slew rateperformance provides a factor of two reduction in echo-spacing across all resolutions typically used forneuroimaging. Such capabilities will result in the ability to study tissue microstructure which has been limited inthe past by gradient performance. This gradient performance coupled with the MUSSELS based algorithmsbeing developed in the Magnetic Resonance Research Facility (MRRF) will provide the ability to assess tissuemicrostructure at high resolution when using the high b-values needed to employ biophysical models tocharacterize tissue microstructure. The ESP scanner will also provide lower SAR that will enhance our T1imaging efforts. In addition the scanner provides a more friendly environment for research subjects. Thisscanner is needed to support the rapidly expanding neuroimaging community that was been brought about bythe formation of the Iowa Neuroscience Institute (INI). The INI has hired ten faculty in the past three years thatare using neuroimaging as part of their research program. We have outgrown the time available on our existingresearch 3T scanner and additional resources are needed to support these neuroimaging efforts. The MRRF serves as a Core University Facility and houses the only research dedicated scanning facilitiesin the State of Iowa. The proposed scanner would support 26 investigators with 33 NIH funded grants with anadditional 15 pending NIH grants. The MRRF supports the research program of investigators from 6 collegesand 15 departments across campus. The facility also supports the research efforts from other state institutions(e.g. Iowa State University) as well as the Midwest. These investigators are a highly productive group whichstudy a variety of diseases including bipolar disorder brain development aging neurodegenerative disordersand cancer. The MRRF is an active research group who are undertaking the development of novel imagingsequences to support our large number of users. This includes novel imaging sequences to assess 1) tissuemicrostructure 2) brain function 3) cancer and 4) metabolism. These projects would significantly benefit fromthe proposed scanner and provide future imaging capabilities for users of the facility. There is strong institution commitment for this equipment. The proposed ESP 3T scanner will be located inthe $120 million Pappajohn Biomedical Discovery Building (PBDB) and the Iowa Institute for BiomedicalImaging (IIBI) was allocated 31000 square feet of space in this building for human and animal imaging. Tohelp support the scanner the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering have recently hired 3additional faculty who are MR physicists. Finally the Department of Radiology will cover the costs to install theESP scanner and will provide financial support in case user fees are unable to cover expenses for the facility.","Aging;Algorithms;Biomedical Engineering;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Communities;Coupled;Development;Diffusion;Disease;Environment;Equipment;Faculty;Fees;Financial Support;Funding;Future;Grant;Head;Image;Institutes;Institution;Iowa;Magnetic Resonance;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolism;Midwestern United States;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurosciences;Performance;Radiology Specialty;Research;Research Personnel;Research Subjects;Research Support;Resolution;Resources;Scanning;Time;Tissues;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;animal imaging;base;bioimaging;biophysical model;college;cost;human imaging;imaging capabilities;neuroimaging;novel;programs;research facility;square foot","University of Iowa  3T ESP MRI Scanner","This grant will support the acquisition of the GE Extreme Slewrate Performance (ESP) 3T head-only scanner atthe University of Iowa.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Genetics; Neurodegenerative","Project Summary:Many cellular processes critical for normal development have devastating consequences when they arenot controlled. Not too long ago protein aggregation was largely equated with pathogenesis. Morerecently we know that proteins aggregate to mediate stress responsiveness cell division long-termmemory and to self-assemble into critical non-membrane bound particles in the nucleus and cytosol. Iffact at least 5% of known proteins have the composition that would allow them to form aggregates.Lack of proper cellular control of protein aggregation leads to amyloid formation which unregulated ispart of the pathogenesis that accompanies devastating diseases like Alzheimers and Huntingtonsdisease and common debilitating conditions like cataracts. The physical nature of aggregates may bethat of phase separated liquid droplets gels disordered aggregates and the ordered aggregatescharacteristic of amyloid. Aggregates serve to greatly increase the local concentration of theaggregating protein and are one part of an equilibrium between different structural states.Consequently the ability and rate of proteins joining or leaving an aggregate is an important featurethat can be regulated and if compromised leads to aggregate based pathology. There is a gap inunderstanding which proteins participate in aggregate formation and how aggregation is regulated invivo. We propose that an ideal system to begin to bridge the gap would be the oocytes of the frogXenopus laevis. We and others have shown that aggregates accumulate during oogenesis in thecytosol and in nucleus. The nuclear particles responsible for RNA transcription and processing by allthree RNA polymerases self-assemble into aggregates generally with RNA as a co-aggregate. Thefocus of this proposal is on nucleolus a prominent non-membrane bound particle responsible forsynthesis and processing of ribosomal RNA the manufacturing of ribosomes helping to mediatecellular responses to stress and DNA damage and appropriately responding to cellular need for newtranslational capacity. We use microscopy immunohistochemistry biochemical fractionation proteindepletion proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to understand the accumulation function and stabilityof the aggregates that establish nucleolar form and function. We take advantage of the uniqueproperties of Xenopus oocyte nuclei including size abundant protein and RNA content and ease ofmanipulation to perform our studies. The findings will impact our understanding of how cells maintainphysiologically normal equilibrium between native and aggregating forms of proteins.","Address;Alzheimer like pathology;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amyloid;Biochemical;Biological;Cataract;Cell Nucleolus;Cell Nucleus;Cell division;Cell physiology;Cells;Characteristics;Cytosol;DNA Damage;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Development;Disease;Ensure;Environment;Equilibrium;Experimental Models;FBXW7 gene;Foundations;Fractionation;Gel;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Processes;Genetic Transcription;Genetic Translation;Homeostasis;Hormones;Huntington Disease;Immunohistochemistry;Liquid substance;Maintenance;Mediating;Memory;Methods;Microscopy;Modeling;NPM1 gene;Nature;Normal Cell;Nuclear;Oocytes;Oogenesis;Organelles;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Phase;Physiological;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;RNA;RNA Helicase;RNA Processing;Rana;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Ribosomal RNA;Ribosomes;Role;Solid;Stress;Structure;System;Testing;Xenopus laevis;Xenopus oocyte;amyloid formation;base;biological adaptation to stress;design;fibrillarin;genetic information;helicase;in vivo;long term memory;nucleophosmin;particle;protein aggregation;protein structure;response;targeted treatment;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;xenopus development","Amyloids aggregates and Nucleolar activity in Xenopus development","Project Narrative:Protein aggregation previously thought to be a defining feature of toxic pathology like Alzheimers ALSand Huntingtons disease has important functions to play when normal cells divide process geneticinformation and respond to stress.

"Biotechnology; Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections","Recently we have observed that in at least one mouse and one human neuronal cell line a putative cytoplasmic viral assembly center (cVAC) is formed around the microtubule organization center (MTOC). It is well-established that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) a non-neuro-invasive human herpesvirus forms a visually distinct cVAC in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. This feature of HCMV assembly has made it a rich source for discovery of functions of viral tegument proteins in viral assembly as well as host factors that are required for viral morphogenesis and egress. We believe that the study of an a HSV cVAC would allow similar rapid advances in the field by establishing a neuronal cell-based model that 1) would provide highly interpretable results for revealing the nature of the HSV assembly compartment such as the dynamics of host membrane rearrangement during infection and essential viral or host factors required 2) would be a rich source of discovery of mechanisms of HSV assembly protein function 3) will allow us to compare cytoplasmic assembly between HCMV and HSV which does not only provide insights regarding the functions of HSV homologs but also has implications in the assembly of other herpesviruses. We propose here to explore the composition of the putative HSV cVAC and test specific hypotheses about the importance of microtubule networks endocytosis and the viral tegument protein pUL51 in its formation.","Animal Model;Apical;Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes;Biology;Capsid;Capsid Proteins;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cell Nucleus;Cell membrane;Cells;Cytomegalovirus;Cytoplasm;Data;Development;Docking;Dynein ATPase;Endocytosis;Epithelial Cells;Event;Fibroblasts;Glycoproteins;Herpesviridae;Herpesvirus 1;Human;Infection;Integration Host Factors;Kinesin;Maintenance;Membrane;Microtubules;Minus End of the Microtubule;Modeling;Morphogenesis;Motor;Mus;Mutagenesis;Nature;Neurons;Pathway interactions;Production;Proteins;Retrieval;Simplexvirus;Site;Source;Structure;System;Testing;Transmembrane Transport;Vaccines;Vesicle;Viral;Viral Genes;Viral Physiology;Viral Proteins;Virion;Virus Assembly;Virus Diseases;base;insight;novel;protein function;recruit","Characterization of the herpes simplex virus cytoplasmic assembly center in neuronal cells","Virus proteins accomplish virus assembly by making critical interactions with each other.

"Cancer; Women's Health","PRMS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe goal of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) at the Holden Comprehensive CancerCenter (HCCC) is to ensure the highest scientific quality of clinical oncology research is conducted atthe HCCC. A two-step review process is used. Trial concepts are first reviewed by the disease-specificMultidisciplinary Oncology Groups (MOGs) to determine enthusiasm for the proposed science potentialimpact of the results and whether the resources and patient population are adequate to complete theproposed studies. The Trial Resource Evaluation Committee (TREC) provides input into whether theinstitutional resources are available to support the trial. Once a protocol is approved by the MOG andhas TREC endorsement it is fully developed and reviewed by the Protocol Review and MonitoringCommittee (PRMC). The PRMC approves rejects or defers the protocol for further development.Studies which have already undergone rigorous peer review including NCI-approved NCTN studies andstudies approved by other NCI-designated cancer centers with an acceptable PRMS are reviewedadministratively by the PRMC Chair. PRMC approval is required before IRB review. The PRMC alsomonitors accrual to ongoing clinical trials. The PRMC closes protocols that do not demonstratescientific progress or that are no longer addressing a scientifically valid question.","Address;Cancer Center Support Grant;Cancer Intervention;Clinical Cancer Center;Clinical Oncology;Clinical Trials;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Development;Disease;Ensure;Evaluation;Goals;Institutional Review Boards;Iowa;Monitor;NCI-Designated Cancer Center;Oncology Group;Peer Review;Process;Protocols documentation;Research;Resources;Review Committee;Science;System;Universities;anticancer research;cancer clinical trial;improved;multidisciplinary;patient population","Protocol Review and Monitoring System","PROJECT NARRATIVENot applicable","NCI","10169602","4/20/2021","PAR-20-043","2P30CA086862-21","2","P30","CA","086862","21","","","7/14/2000","3/31/2026","Cancer Centers Study Section (A)[NCI-A]","9474","9847222","GOODHEART, MICHAEL J","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2021","3/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","88230"," ","57107","31123"," "," ",
"Cancer; Patient Safety; Women's Health","CPDM PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) efforts of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center(HCCC) are managed through two related components  Clinical Research Services (CRS) and Data andSafety Monitoring (DSM). These components have grown and strengthened significantly over the prior fundingperiod. They are critical to the mission of the HCCC and support HCCC clinical cancer research includingtreatment non-treatment interventional and non-interventional studies. They encompass clinical researchregulatory and data and safety monitoring. This includes investigator-initiated trials (IITs) National ClinicalTrials Network (NCTN) trials consortium trials and industry sponsored trials. Services provided by the CRSrelated to protocol management include protocol selection development routing modification and adverseevent monitoring. The CRS also provides trial specific support through staff that assist in assignment of trials toteams protocol listing and promotion accrual tracking assistance with screening and consenting subjectsdata management quality assurance and education for early career clinical investigators. The CRS worksclosely with other shared research resources to support translational cancer research particularly Biostatistics(Biostats) and the Biospecimens Procurement and Molecular Epidemiology Resource (BioMER). A newcomponent of the CRS is the Radiology Core Lab (RCL) that provides quantitative imaging services for clinicaltrials. DSM is coordinated through HCCC's DSM Committee. The DSM has a distinct function from theProtocol Review and Monitoring Committee and IRB. DSM focuses on IITs and ensures the development of anacceptable data and safety monitoring plan assesses subject safety monitors clinical trial data veracity andprotocol adherence and provides education to investigators.

Theoverarching goal of HCCC COE is to alleviate Iowans' cancer burden by activating researchers and thepopulation in assessing and addressing community-aligned priorities. Priorities include cancers in which Iowais a top 5 state in incidence mortality or is increasing over time (colorectal kidney leukemia lymphomamelanoma pancreatic); rural access to cancer screening and care; obesity-related cancers; environmentalexposures to radon and agricultural chemicals; HPV-related cancers; and racial/ethnic disparities in cancermortality.HCCC COE includes three interrelated specific aims and associated activities: (1) to assess the catchmentarea needs and understand health disparities; (2) to address these needs through strategic research acrossthe HCCC; and (3) to engage the community and disseminate and evaluate evidence-based interventions. Atthe center of these aims is the HCCC Community Advisory Board whose advice guides priority-settinginclusion of under-represented populations in research and assuring cancer control activities are aligned withpriorities. HCCC COE activities include providing data and geospatial visualizations to monitor goals andsupport community health needs assessment; communicating with researchers about community-drivenpriorities; pilot grants and technical assistance for researchers from any program for community-engagedresearch; expansion of efforts to enhance inclusion of under-represented populations; expansion of a ruralcancer research network; and linking research to policy and disseminating information about cancer preventionand control guidelines and policies.HCCC Director George Weiner MD and Associate Director of Population Science and CommunityEngagement Elizabeth Chrischilles PhD conduct strategic planning in consultation with the 20-member HCCCCommunity Advisory Board and three HCCC COE co-leaders Mary Charlton PhD (Aim 1); Natoshia AskelsonPhD (Aim 2); and Kelly Sittig (Aim 3).

"Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Precision Medicine","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTDuring the past two decades a significant body of evidence has shown that metabolic oxidation/reductionreactions represent a significant underlying mechanism contributing to promotion and progression ofmalignancy as well as a therapeutic target for selectively sensitizing cancer cells to therapeutic interventionsand protecting normal tissues from conventional cytotoxic therapies. Evolving in parallel has been therecognition that advanced medical imaging techniques measuring metabolic changes in cancer versus normaltissues before and during therapy show great promise in allowing non-invasive quantitation and monitoring offundamental differences in cancer cell metabolism to improve cancer therapy. The overarching hypothesis inthe Free Radical Metabolism and Imaging (FRMI) program is that cancer cells exist in a chronic state ofmetabolic oxidative stress that represents a significant underlying mechanism contributing to promotion andprogression of malignancy as well as a therapeutic target for sensitizing tumor cells to therapy as well asprotecting against normal tissue injury. Furthermore functional imaging techniques measuring metabolicchanges in tumors versus normal tissues have shown great promise as predictors and biomarkers that can beused to improve cancer therapy. The diverse membership of this unique program includes 33 full members andfive associate members representing two colleges and nine departments. These investigators work together totake full advantage of the convergence of the science in these two related disciplines for developing amechanism based biochemical rationale for new image-guided cancer therapies and diagnostic/prognostictools. FRMI members are highly collaborative. During the last period of support 83% of a total of 235 cancerrelevant publications were collaborative including 75 (32%) intraprogrammatic 83 (35%) interprogrammaticand 127 (54%) interinstitutional publications including 17 in high impact (Impact Factor >10) journals. Programmember cancer research was supported by $3.7 million of direct peer-reviewed funding including $2.1 millionof NCI funding in the last year of CCSG support. Productive intra/interprogrammatic and interinstitutionalgroups are leading advances in the development of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant to cancertherapy supported by a new NCI P01 superoxide dismutase mimetics for protection of normal tissuestoxicities and peptide-targeted radionuclide-based theragnostic treatments.","Adjuvant;Algorithms;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center Support Grant;Cancer Diagnostics;Chronic;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;Development;Discipline;Epigenetic Process;Free Radicals;Functional Imaging;Funding;Genetic;Head and Neck Cancer;Image;Imaging Techniques;Imaging technology;Journals;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical Imaging;Metabolic;Metabolism;Monitor;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal Cell;Normal tissue morphology;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Peer Review;Peptides;Pharmacologic Ascorbate;Phase III Clinical Trials;Publications;Radio;Radioisotopes;Research;Research Personnel;Science;Signal Transduction;Superoxide Dismutase;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Toxic effect;Tumor Biology;Work;anticancer research;base;biomarker development;cancer cell;cancer therapy;college;image guided;imaging biomarker;imaging platform;imaging program;improved;member;metabolic imaging;mimetics;neoplastic cell;novel;oral mucositis;predictive marker;prognostic tool;programs;theranostics;therapeutic target;therapy outcome;tissue injury;translational study;tumor;tumor metabolism","Free Radical Metabolism and Imaging","PROJECT NARRATIVENot applicable","NCI","10169595","4/20/2021","PAR-20-043","2P30CA086862-21","2","P30","CA","086862","21","","","7/14/2000","3/31/2026","Cancer Centers Study Section (A)[NCI-A]","9467","1891156","SPITZ, DOUGLAS ROBERT","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2021","3/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","35506"," ","22981","12525"," "," ",

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Genetics; Rare Diseases; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTResearch in the Cancer Genes and Pathways (CGP) program focuses on defining essential molecular andbiological mechanisms underlying tumor pathogenesis and successful therapy. The primary goal of this basicscience program is to discover characterize and validate new tumor alterations (genetic molecular andcellular pathways) to fuel translational cancer research that will lead to improved cancer patient outcomes. Thisis accomplished through three overlapping research aims centered on the study of 1) structural and functionalgenetic and nuclear alterations that promote tumorigenesis 2) intrinsic cellular processes and pathways thatdrive malignant transformation and tumor progression and 3) tumor extrinsic factors such as immune cellsand environmental carcinogens that contribute to cancer development and suppression. Key scientificachievements over the prior funding period include defining the role of RAD52 protein in damaged DNA repairand genome stability identifying metastatic gene signatures and druggable pathways driving neuroendocrinetumor (NET) pathogenesis and deciphering fundamental mechanisms by which external mechanical forcesinfluence tumor cell metabolism. CGP membership includes 42 full and nine associate members spanningseventeen departments across four colleges. Annual direct cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding in the lastbudget year was $6.7 million with $1.2 million from the NCI. CGP members are highly collaborative havingauthored or co-authored 384 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past four years with 22% (n=85) intraprogrammatic 30% (n= 117) interprogrammatic and 54% (n= 206) inter-institutional publications. 57manuscripts appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor >10).

"Genetics; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention; Vaccine Related","This grant proposal is submitted under PA-18-872 Research to advance vaccine safety. The impetus for thisR21 grant proposal is a recent report from this lab in the Journal of Child Neurology 2019. The title of thearticle: Severe herpes zoster following varicella vaccination of immunocompetent young children. Thehypothesis for this proposal is that VZV ORF0 is a major determinant of attenuation in the live varicella vaccinevOka; further a variant of the current vaccine product that contains the wild-type ORF0 allele rather than theattenuated ORF0 allele is more likely to reactivate as severe herpes zoster. My lab and a Canadian lab made acritical discovery about VZV attenuation after we sequenced the entire genome of the well-known Ellen labstrain. We had previously shown using the Arvin labs SCID mouse model that the Ellen strain was evenmore attenuated than the Oka vaccine strain. When we compared the complete sequence of Ellen and vOkawe made a completely unpredictable discovery. The two strains had common SNPs in IE62 gene asexpected. What was not expected was the discovery that the Ellen lab strain (a wild type strain isolated inGeorgia in the 1960s) had a vaccine-type ORF0 gene. Unbeknownst to VZV researchers therefore the Ellenstrain had acquired polymorphisms in both IE62 (ORF62) and ORF0 that were extremely similar to the vaccinestrain. The goal of the R21 grant is to initiate studies to define ORF0 as an important determinant ofattenuation in the VZV vaccine. Essentially therefore this grant proposes that the virologists who first madethe live varicella vaccine in the 1970s omitted a step in the late design of the vaccine which allowed a morevirulent variant to be included in the final vaccine product. The research plan includes two specific aims andalso includes two consultants. The importance of this research has vaccine safety relevance. There havebeen thousands of reports of adverse event after varicella vaccination including death from disseminatedvaccine virus infection. Since the original stocks of vaccine virus were never cloned by the Takahashi lab inOsaka the current commercial vaccine product contains a variant with wild-type ORF0 allele. We suggest thatthe vaccine subspecies or variant with wild-type ORF0 may be causing many of the severe side effectsfollowing varicella vaccination.","Acyclovir;Admission activity;Adverse event;Alleles;Applications Grants;Arginine;Arvin;Asians;Asthma;Attenuated;Attenuated Vaccines;Autoimmune Diseases;Cessation of life;Chickenpox;Chickenpox Vaccine;Child;Country;Data;Disease;European;Exanthema;FDA approved;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;Genome;Goals;Grant;Hearing;Herpes zoster disease;Immunize;Immunocompetent;Infection;Injections;Iowa;Journals;Lead;Left;Mutate;Mutation;North America;Nucleotides;Open Reading Frames;Patients;Pediatric Neurology;Physicians;Proteins;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Role;SCID Mice;Scientist;Secondary to;Site;Skin;Spinal Ganglia;Structure;Terminator Codon;Thigh structure;Transverse Myelitis;Travel;United States;VZV vaccine;Vaccination;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Variant;Viral;Viremia;Virulence;Virulent;Virus;Virus Diseases;Work;afferent nerve;attenuation;base;dermatome;improved;mouse model;side effect;vaccine safety;varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein gp1;varicella-zoster virus immediate early protein 62;virtual;whole genome","Wild-type allele found in varicella vaccine virus during severe herpes zoster","The live attenuated varicella vaccine was approved by the FDA in 1995 for universal administration to all children in theUnited States.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Neurosciences; Substance Misuse","Project Summary / AbstractOur broad goal is to provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of alcohol use disorders(AUDs) by ascertaining how Regulator of G protein signaling 6 (RGS6) functions in the mesolimbic circuit as acritical modulator of alcohol (EtOH) seeking and reward behaviors. EtOH is the most commonly abused drugworldwide and despite decades of research the neurobiological mechanisms underlying EtOH seekingbehavior and dependence are not fully understood. As a result there are few effective therapeutics to reducealcohol cravings or withdrawal symptomology and abstinence remains the only way to prevent AUDs. This proposal is based upon our discovery that RGS6 promotes mouse EtOH seeking and rewardbehaviors and on a subsequent GWAS identifying RGS6 as a gene linked to human AUDs. Based on ourprevious work we hypothesized that RGS6 promotes EtOH seeking behavior by negatively regulating neuronalGi/o-coupled receptors (GPCRs) implicated in alcoholism. Indeed we found that RGS6-/- mice consumeless EtOH when given free access and are less susceptible to EtOH reward dependence and withdrawal.Antagonism of D2Rs or GABABRs and inhibition of dopamine transporter (DAT) activity which is upregulatedby Gi/o-coupled GPCRs partially and completely restored the reduced EtOH consumption in RGS6-/- micerespectively. Our findings suggest that by inhibiting GPCR-Gi-DAT upregulation in VTA DA neurons RGS6promotes EtOH-induced dopamine (DA) neurotransmission and behavioral responses. RGS6 control of thispathway would represent a previously unknown mechanism modulating the intensity and duration of Gisignaling in VTA neurons to titre DA levels responsible for acute and chronic behavioral effects of EtOH. Here we propose to test the central hypothesis that RGS6 regulation of G protein signaling in VTA DAneurons plays a critical role in promoting dopaminergic neurotransmission responsible for EtOH seeking andreward behaviors. Aim 1 will determine the role of mesolimbic RGS6 on EtOH seeking and reward behaviorsusing mice with selective deletion of RGS6 in VTA DA neurons as well as rescue studies with RGS6 or its Gprotein-defective mutant. Aim 2 will determine the role of RGS6 in VTA DA neurotransmission and on EtOHconsumption in mice using optogenetics. We will employ state of the art cell type-specific optogeneticsneuronal ensemble recordings and Ca2+ imaging in the NAc as well as a novel EtOH-triggered optogeneticapproach to determine how RGS6 modulates mesolimbic DA neurotransmission and EtOH consumption in realtime in freely moving mice. These studies are significant as they will illuminate an entirely novel pathway in the mesolimbic circuita major dopaminergic pathway in the brain implicated in EtOH behavioral reward and addiction. We willaddress a critical barrier to progress in the understanding and treatment of AUDs as RGS6 has been identifiedas a human AUD-linked gene and we seek to increase our basic knowledge of its role in the mesolimbic circuit.","Abstinence;Acute;Address;Affect;Alcohol consumption;Alcohol dependence;Alcohol withdrawal syndrome;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Availability;Biology;Brain;Chronic;Color;Consumption;Corpus striatum structure;Coupled;Dependence;Dopamine;Dopamine D2 Receptor;Ethanol;GTP-Binding Protein Regulators;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genes;Goals;Healthcare Systems;Human;Image;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Link;Mediating;Molecular;Mus;Neurons;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Play;Population;Presynaptic Terminals;Prevalence;RGS Proteins;Receptor Inhibition;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Research;Rewards;Role;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Synapses;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Up-Regulation;Withdrawal;Work;addiction;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol craving;alcohol reward;alcohol seeking behavior;alcohol use disorder;base;behavioral response;cell type;design;deter alcohol use;dopamine transporter;dopaminergic neuron;drug of abuse;experimental study;genome wide association study;innovation;insight;mutant;neural circuit;neurobiological mechanism;neurotransmission;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;optogenetics;presynaptic;receptor;socioeconomics;synergism;therapeutic target;therapeutically effective;transmission process","RGS6 in mesolimbic circuits as a therapeutic target for alcohol use disorders","Project NarrativeAlcohol is the most commonly abused drug worldwide and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcoholseeking behavior and dependence are not fully understood.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Neurosciences; Substance Misuse","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse is a significant public health burden that is often difficult to manage with current treatment options. Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE can induce adaptations in neural circuits that govern anxiety and motivated behavior and may have relevance for ethanol dependence. The goal of this application is to dissect neural circuits that are critically involved in dependence induced escalations in ethanol drinking. Recent evidence indicates that both 5-HT2CR and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell contribute to CIE enhanced drinking. My central hypothesis is that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) augments 5-HT release in the NAc which activate local dynorphin neurons that in turn reduce dopamine release. This degrades the reward value of ethanol and leads to increased ethanol consumption. In Specific Aim 1 I will use a multiplexed DREADD strategy to delineate the role of 5HT inputs to the NAc shell in CIE induced elevations in voluntary ethanol drinking. In Specific Aim 2 I will examine the impact of CIE on excitability f dynorphin neurons using slice electrophysiology. Based on preliminary data that stimulation of NAc dynorphin neurons modulates dopamine release in the NAc I will also use slice voltammetry to examine how CIE shapes dynorphin-dopamine interactions in the NAc. Specific Aim 3 is designed to clarify the role of these NAc dynorphin neurons in excessive ethanol drinking after CIE.

"Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Bacterial populations including those that affect human health are largely controlled bybacteriophages. Phages change the composition of bacterial ecosystems and strongly influencebacterial evolution. Defense mechanisms that protect bacteria from phages are importantregulators of these host-pathogen interactions. Defining these mechanisms is crucial tounderstanding bacterial compositional dynamics and pathogenicity. CRISPR-Cas systems aresophisticated and diverse mechanisms that allow bacteria to memorize infection events anddefend themselves upon reinfection. In addition to their important role in mediating bacteria-phage interactions CRISPR-Cas systems have been harnessed for genome manipulationtechnologies that have greatly facilitated biomedical research and have enormous potential forhuman therapies. The goal of our research program is to fully define the mechanisms andspecificities of a variety of nucleic acid-protein complexes that direct CRISPR-mediatedimmunity and have potential for CRISPR technology. Our program is divided betweenunderstanding the process of adaptation during which a bacterial cell is immunized andinterference during which the CRISPR-Cas system neutralizes an infection. We and othershave recently discovered higher-order adaptation complexes containing poorly defined proteinsubunits that are essential for effective immunization. Our goal is to uncover the molecular stepsthat enable specificity and precision by higher-order adaptation complexes ensuring productiveimmunization events. Following immunization Cas effector complexes that neutralize infectionduring interference must quickly recognize pathogens a task made even more challengingwhen phages evolve and evade detection. Our goal is to understand how Cas effectors canmaintain effective immunity even in the face of pathogen evolution. Through this researchprogram we will contribute to the overall understanding of how CRISPR-Cas systems impactbacterial populations and help ensure that CRISPR-based research and therapeutic tools areused safely and effectively.","Affect;Bacteria;Bacteriophages;Biomedical Research;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cells;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complex;Defense Mechanisms;Detection;Ecosystem;Ensure;Event;Evolution;Genome;Goals;Health;Human;Immunity;Immunization;Immunize;Infection;Mediating;Molecular;Nucleic Acids;Pathogenicity;Play;Population;Population Dynamics;Process;Protein Subunits;Research;Role;Specificity;Structure;System;Technology;Therapeutic;Virus;Work;base;improved;pathogen;programs;protein complex;protein function;tool","Defining mechanisms of diverse CRISPR-Cas complexes","PROJECT NARRATIVECRISPR-Cas systems allow bacteria to defend themselves against viruses and have alsoprovided revolutionary tools for improving human health.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTEnzymes are remarkable nanomachines that play a myriad of essential functions in cellular metabolism.Modulation of enzyme structure and flexibility by cofactor/substrate binding provides an important source ofregulation of enzyme function yet our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms coupling proteindynamics to enzymatic activity is still largely incomplete. Indeed while our appreciation of how conformationaldynamics mediate biological function is predominantly based on structural studies on low-complexity low-molecular weight systems enzymes are typically oligomeric multidomain proteins whose biological functiondepends on an intricate coupling among intradomain interdomain and intersubunit conformational equilibria.Without a comprehensive atomic-resolution understanding of conformational dynamics-mediated self-regulatory mechanisms in high-complexity high-molecular weight enzymes our ability to understand andexploit ubiquitous phenomena in biology such as allosterism and cooperativity will continue to lag.Here we will use NMR combined with other biophysical and biochemical approaches to reveal how thecomplex interplay between cofactor/substrate binding and conformational dynamics regulates the activity ofhigh molecular weight enzymes that are essential for human and bacterial metabolism. The systems of interestin this proposal are Enzyme I (EI) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) and the human RNAdemethylases FTO and Alkbh5. EI is a 128 kDa dimeric enzyme whose activity depends on the synergisticaction of four conformational equilibria that results in a series of large intradomain interdomain andintersubunit structural rearrangements modulated by substrate binding. The PTS is a central regulator ofbacterial metabolism that controls multiple cellular functions including virulence and biofilm formation throughphosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. Therefore understanding EI activity at atomic level willilluminate the fundamental mechanisms governing long-range interdomain communication in proteins and maysuggest new therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections. The second part of the present proposalfocuses on enzymes that are capable of catalyzing oxidative demethylation of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A).m6A is the most abundant modification in eukaryotic mRNA. Dynamic regulation of the m6A modification playsan important role in gene expression cellular response to external stimuli oncogenesis adipogenesis and indevelopment of other human diseases. We will investigate the mechanisms that regulate the function of thehuman RNA demethylases FTO and Alkbh5 with atomic resolution. Our results will guide new strategies toachieve selective inhibition of FTO and Alkbh5 to control gene expression and to contrast progression ofcancer. In summary my research program will elucidate the coupling between large scale conformationalchanges and function in two distinct classes of high molecular weight multidomain enzymes providing newinsights for future therapies for obesity and cancer as well as novel antibiotic targets.","Antibiotics;Bacterial Infections;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Process;Biology;Biophysics;Cell physiology;Communication;Complex;Coupling;Development;Enzymes;Future;Gene Expression;Human;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Metabolism;Microbial Biofilms;Modification;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Weight;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Play;Protein Dynamics;Proteins;RNA;Regulation;Research;Resolution;Role;Series;Source;Stimulus;Structure;System;Virulence;bacterial metabolism;base;cofactor;combat;demethylation;dimer;enzyme structure;flexibility;human disease;insight;interest;lipid biosynthesis;nanomachine;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;obesity treatment;programs;protein protein interaction;response;small molecule;tumor progression;tumorigenesis","Atomic-level characterization of self-regulatory mechanisms in large multidomain enzymes","PROJECT NARATIVEThe proposed research will reveal regulatory mechanisms in high molecular weight enzymes that areessential for human and bacterial metabolism.

"Health Disparities; Minority Health","Project Summary / AbstractThis is the third competing renewal application for a training program whose main goal is to promote theinterdisciplinary training of graduate students in Pharmacological Sciences. Its secondary goal is to fosterbroader scientific and social interactions among faculty and students in the Pharmacological Sciences.As evidence of the interdisciplinary nature of this program our trainees come from six departments and fourinterdepartmental graduate programs in three colleges. The recruitment of 37 trainees with strong-to-outstanding credentials from outside the Department of Pharmacology (of a total of 50) is tangible evidencethat this TG functions as a highly effective mechanism to attract the interest and promote the interdisciplinarytraining of graduate students in the Pharmacological Sciences regardless of departmental affiliation.The TG curriculum provides both basic and advanced instruction in Pharmacological Sciences and isundergoing continual review and revision to ensure that it fulfills the needs of the program and the students. Itscore course sequence Principles of Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics & Pharmacogenomics exposestrainees to the fundamental principles of drug action and molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of majordrug classes. The flagship course of this program Advanced Problem Solving in Pharmacological Sciencesprovides trainees multiple opportunities to work as a team to design collaborative research plans therebyhoning their ability to communicate scientific ideas and generate workable solutions to contemporary problemsin the Pharmacological Sciences. Two modules are new to the curriculum. Basic Biostatistics and ExperimentalDesign is the program's response to NIH's call for enhanced rigor and reproducibility in science. ScienceCommunication in the Digital Age and the associated workshop Careers outside the Academy: ScienceCommunication broaden the delivery of career skills to better prepare our trainees for the job market.Symposia a bi-annual retreat a series of summer-time brown bag discussion luncheons as well as semi-weekly interactions during Pharmacology Seminar further promote program identity and collaborations.This TG has led to a documented increase in the teaching mentoring and research interactions amongprogram faculty and their students.

As pain becomesmore frequent and severe it results in measurable declines in the children's health and creates economicburden on families. Effective treatments that target pain in these children will lessen the risk of opioid exposureand continued pain and disability into adulthood. There is evidence that psychological treatments principallycognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) can decrease pain and disability in children. However even wheneffective treatments have been validated most children do not receive psychological intervention for chronicpain management due to barriers that prevent access to treatment such as lack of trained clinicians andgeographic distance to treatment centers. Alternative forms of treatment delivery through the Internet canovercome these barriers. We have already made significant progress in developing and evaluating an internet-delivered psychological intervention called Web-based Management of Adolescent Pain (WebMAP). Ourfindings from a multicenter randomized controlled trial indicated that children in families that received thisintervention experienced significant improvements in pain-related disability depression and parent-perceivedimpact of pain compared to children receiving patient education alone. The proposed project is designed toapply our expertise in delivering Internet-based pain management programs to the largest cohort (INSPPIRE:INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) of well-phenotyped children with CPto reduce pain pain-related disability and enhance health-related quality of life. The overall hypothesis ofthis application is that web-based CBT will significantly improve pain pain-related disability andHRQOL. We plan to recruit a large multicenter sample of 260 children and adolescents (ages 10-17 years)with CP and their parents from INSPPIRE centers to evaluate the efficacy of WebMAP. The study design is atwo (group) x three (time point) randomized controlled double-blinded trial. Participants will be randomlyassigned to receive online access to either patient education (WebED) or CBT (WebMAP) over an 8-10 weektreatment period. The primary study outcome is pain-related disability measured at pre-treatment immediatelypost-treatment and at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include child reported pain health-relatedquality of life depression and anxiety symptoms and medication use. We will also evaluate geneticpolymorphisms clinical and behavioral phenotypic factors that predict treatment response. This projectrepresents a significant advance in pain management for children with CP by evaluating the first ever non-pharmacologic pain intervention in these patients which may guide future developments in the management ofchronic pain associated with CP. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop effective andflexible treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce chronic abdominal pain and pain-relateddisability in children with CP.","APOA5 gene;Abdominal Pain;Adolescent;Adult;Aftercare;Age;Behavioral;Biological Factors;CYP2C19 gene;CYP2D6 gene;CYP3A4 gene;CYP3A5 gene;Caring;Characteristics;Child;Child Health;Childhood;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive Therapy;Control Groups;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Double-Blind Method;Double-blind trial;Economic Burden;Economics;Education;Emergency department visit;Emotional;Exposure to;Family;Frequencies;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Polymorphism;Genotype;Geography;Goals;HTR2A gene;Headache;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Hospitalization;Image;Inflammation;Interleukin-10;International;Internet;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Measurable;Measures;Medical;Mental Depression;Musculoskeletal Pain;Online Systems;Operative Surgical Procedures;Opioid;Outcome;Outcome Study;Pain;Pain Research;Pain management;Pancreatitis;Parents;Participant;Patient Education;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacological Treatment;Phenotype;Physical Function;Placebos;Population;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Predictive Factor;Pseudogenes;Psychosocial Factor;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Reporting;Research;Research Design;Risk;SPINK1 gene;Sampling;Severities;Social Functioning;Testing;Time;Training;Variant;anxiety symptoms;base;behavioral phenotyping;chronic abdominal pain;chronic pain;chronic pain management;chronic pancreatitis;claudin-1 protein;clinical phenotype;cohort;cost;demographics;depressive symptoms;design;disability;drug metabolism;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;emotional functioning;experience;family burden;flexibility;follow-up;genetic risk factor;health care service utilization;health related quality of life;improved;lipid metabolism;next generation sequencing;opioid exposure;opioid use;pain outcome;pain reduction;pain self-management;pain symptom;pediatric patients;precision medicine;predicting response;prescription opioid;prevent;primary outcome;programs;psychologic;randomized trial;recruit;response;risk stratification;secondary outcome;treatment center;treatment duration;treatment response","A Randomized Trial of a Web-based Non-Pharmacological Pain Intervention for Pediatric Chronic Pancreatitis","Project NarrativeAbdominal pain is common in children with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and as they continue into adulthood thedisease progresses with increased pain and greater exposure to opioids.

"Cancer; Contraception/Reproduction; Estrogen; Uterine Cancer; Women's Health","Project Summary/AbstractWhile outcomes have substantially improved for many types of cancer endometrial cancer incidences anddeaths are on the rise with the five year survival rate worse today than three decades ago; owing largely to theineffectiveness of current treatments. As a tumor is exquisitely sensitive to the growth promoting effects ofestrogen and the growth limiting effects of progesterone hormonal therapy for endometrial cancer usingprogestins has been a traditional choice for treatment. It is highly effective in the short term; howeverresponsiveness wanes over time due to loss of progesterone receptor (PR) expression and recurrences arecommon. There is a critical need to identify strategies to improve or restore responsiveness to progestintherapy and we propose that molecularly enhanced progestin therapy will make a major positive impact onsurvival of patients with endometrial cancer. The objective of this application is to identify the molecularmechanisms driving the downregulation of the PR in endometrial cancer patients and identify novel strategiesto further enhance the effectiveness of progestin therapy. We will develop molecular agent combinations withprogestins that will significantly enhance tumor cell differentiation in vitro and improve survival in mousexenograft models of human endometrial cancer. Our central hypothesis is that targeting PR repressors willenhance the expression of PR the most important tumor suppressor in the endometrium thereby improvingresponse to progestin therapy. This hypothesis stems from our strong recently published data in endometrialcancer cells that PR expression is downregulated through distinct molecular mechanisms and epigeneticmodulators potently increase PR expression and tumor suppressor activity. We have now identified additionalPR suppressors that have the potential to more clearly define the multiple mechanisms of PR inhibition inendometrial cancer setting the stage for new therapeutic opportunities. In Aim 1 we will determine the impactof epigenetic modulators on PR expression and activity in endometrial cancer patients from our related clinicaltrial NRG-GY011 results; in Aim 2 we will enhance PR expression using small molecular drugs and test drugefficacy using in vitro and in vivo endometrial cancer models. In Aim 3 we will identify novel PRdownregulation mechanisms using genome-wide gene silencing. At the completion of these studies it is ourexpectation that we will have identified mechanisms of hormonal resistance successfully integrated innovativemolecular therapies into enhanced progestin therapeutic regimens in preclinical and clinical studies and informfor the design of future endometrial cancer clinical trials. As such these studies have a strong potential toimpact the alarming trend towards declining survival in endometrial cancer.","Aftercare;Apoptosis;Area;Automobile Driving;Biopsy;Cancer Model;Cancer Patient;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Data;Down-Regulation;Drug Screening;Effectiveness;Endometrial;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrium;Enrollment;Epigenetic Process;Estrogens;Future;Gene Silencing;Genes;Genomics;Goals;Growth;HDAC2 gene;HDAC4 gene;Histologic;Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor;Hormonal;Hormone Receptor;Human;Hysterectomy;In Vitro;Incidence;Intervention;Knock-out;Laboratories;Libraries;MAP Kinase Gene;Measures;Medroxyprogesterone 17-Acetate;Molecular;Mus;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Prior Therapy;Progesterone;Progesterone Receptors;Progestin Therapy;Progestins;Publishing;Randomized;Receptor Inhibition;Recurrence;Regimen;Reporter Genes;Repression;Research;Resistance;SETDB1 gene;Specimen;Survival Rate;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States National Institutes of Health;Uterus;Work;Xenograft Model;analog;base;cancer cell;cancer clinical trial;cancer type;design;drug candidate;drug efficacy;drug testing;evidence base;expectation;first-in-human;genome-wide;hormone therapy;human model;human tissue;improved;improved outcome;in vitro Model;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;knock-down;medication safety;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;preclinical study;public health relevance;receptor downregulation;receptor expression;recruit;response;safety and feasibility;small molecule;stem;treatment choice;trend;tumor;tumor xenograft","Restoring Progestin Sensitivity in Endometrial Cancer","Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance StatementWhile outcomes have substantially improved for many types of cancer endometrial cancer incidence anddeaths are on the rise due in large part to inadequate sensitivity to hormonal therapy.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Pediatric; Substance Misuse; Underage Drinking; Women's Health","Epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that alcohol abuse promotes the development of breastcancer. There are two features of alcohol-induced tumor promotion: 1) alcohol consumption increases the riskof breast cancer; 2) alcohol promotes cancer progression and is associated with more aggressive forms ofbreast cancer. Therefore alcohol exposure could affect both phases of mammary tumor development namelytumorigenesis (cell transformation and onset of tumor) and cancer aggression (tumor growth metastasis anddrug resistance/recurrence). Adolescent alcohol drinking is a serious problem worldwide. The drinking age isgetting younger while the amount of alcohol uptake per occasion has increased. Adolescentalcohol consumption is a risk factor for accidents injuries mental illnesses or some chronic diseases andpathologies as well as for the appearance of addictions including alcoholism. Although the harmful effect ofadolescent alcohol exposure on the brain structures and behaviors such as cognitive deficits and addictionhas been well studied its effect on tumor risk has never explored. The molecular mechanisms underlyingalcohol tumor promotion however remain unclear. The adolescent is a critical period of mammary glanddevelopment. Our study indicated that adolescent mice were more sensitive to alcohol tumor promoting effectthan adult mice. Our findings suggest that alcohol-induced tumorigenesis and progression/aggressiveness mayoperate by different mechanisms. The p21 Activated Kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine threonine kinases;PAK1 and PAK4 are particularly implicated in the carcinogenesis of mammary tumor. There are four membersof the mammalian p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family namely p38 p38 p38 and p38.Although some of their physiological functions may overlap the role of these MAPKs is quite different.p38MAPK has been suggested to involve in the progression/aggressiveness of breast cancer. The centralhypothesis for this proposal is that alcohol-promoted mammary tumorigenesis and aggressiveness is mediatedby different mechanisms: alcohol-induced tumorigenesis is mainly mediated by PAK1/PDK4 andestrogen/progestrone signaling pathway in the adolescents while alcohol-induced aggressiveness mainly ismediated by p38MAPK signaling pathway. We also hypothesize that the enhanced sensitivity of adolescentto alcohol is due to that the signaling pathways regulating the development of mammary glands are moresensitive to alcohol exposure. This proposal will test the hypothesis using both in vitro and in vivo approaches.This proposal will for the first time investigate the impact of adolescent alcohol exposure on the development ofmammary glands and tumorigenesis/progression. It will not only elucidate the cellular and molecularmechanisms underlying alcohol-mediated tumor promotion but also help to develop therapeutic strategies fortreating alcohol promotion of breast cancer.","Accidents;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Affect;Age;Aggressive behavior;Alcohol abuse;Alcohol consumption;Alcohol dependence;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Animal Model;Appearance;Behavior;Behavior Disorders;Brain;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Risk Factor;Breast Cancer cell line;Breast Epithelial Cells;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical Research;Cognitive deficits;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug resistance;Estrogens;Family;Female;Funding;In Vitro;Individual;Injury;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Mammary Tumorigenesis;Mammary gland;Mediating;Mental disorders;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Modeling;Molecular;Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus;Mus;Neoplasm Metastasis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Phase;Physiological;Prevalence;Process;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Recurrence;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Pathway;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Transgenic Mice;Treatment outcome;Tumor Promotion;United States;Vulnerable Populations;Woman;addiction;adolescent alcohol effect;adolescent alcohol exposure;aged;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol effect;alcohol exposure;alcohol risk;binge drinking;brain behavior;breast cancer progression;cancer risk;cell transformation;critical period;drinking;epidemiology study;in vitro Model;in vivo;malignant breast neoplasm;mammary gland development;member;neoplastic cell;novel;p21 activated kinase;p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression;tumorigenesis;underage drinking;uptake;young adult","ALCOHOL AND BREAST CANCER","Alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk and aggressiveness of breast cancersuggesting that alcohol may enhance tumorigenesis and progression of breast cancer.

"Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Mental Health; Pediatric; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human; Tourette Syndrome","PROJECT SUMMARYDespite strong evidence for a genetic contribution to Tourette disorder (TD) progress in the identification ofspecific risk genes has been until quite recently halting. However building upon NIMH's support for our initialefforts to ascertain TD trios as well as our highly successful experience with genomic investigations of autismspectrum disorders (ASD) we have now demonstrated a clear path forward for reliable systematic genediscovery in TD. Our TD work recently published in the journal Neuron identified one high confidence and threeprobable novel TD risk genes collectively pointing to neurite outgrowth and axon pathfinding as potentialpathological mechanisms1. More importantly however our findings demonstrate for the first time a clear excessof de novo damaging point mutations in individuals with TD with effect sizes that rival our recent findings in ASD.This discovery strongly suggests that sequencing of larger cohorts will reliably and rapidly lead to theidentification of many more highly penetrant risk genes. Moreover our recent work suggests an increased yieldof highly penetrant damaging de novo variants in probands who are affected both with TD and obsessivecompulsive disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder suggesting that our efforts may well also offeravenues to study the overlap in genetic risks for these often-comorbid conditions. Our current applicationproposes to: (1) expand our well characterized TD trio cohort by an additional 1000 simplex trios and make thephenotypic data and biological materials widely and rapidly available to the broad scientific community; (2)accelerate gene discovery via genotyping (for large de novo CNV identification) and whole exome sequencing(for de novo single nucleotide variant insertion/deletion variant and small CNV identification) of these additionalTD trios making these data rapidly and widely available as well; (3) extend the process of in silico and in vitrogenomics investigations to elaborate the biology of TD with the long term goal of developing novel and moreeffective treatment strategies; and (4) begin biological characterization of TD variants using iPSC-derivedneuronal cells. Given the potentially debilitating nature of TD alone and a population prevalence ofapproximately 1 in 100 individuals such advances would confer a significant public health benefit. The studydesign again rests heavily on the collaborative R01 mechanism that will bring together deep experience with theTD phenotype at multiple sites across the globe with scientists with a strong track record of success in rarevariant human genomics and gene discovery. Specifically the proposal includes seven primary US sites fourdirect subcontracts (two USA sites for clinical supervision and data analysis and two foreign coordinating sites)and fourteen secondary clinical sites within Europe and South Korea.","Affect;Asians;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Biocompatible Materials;Biological;Biology;Brain;C2 Domain;Cell model;Cells;Child;Clinical;Clinical Data;Code;Communities;Copy Number Polymorphism;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Dimensions;Ensure;Europe;Family;Family Study;Foundations;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Risk;Genome;Genomics;Genotype;Gilles de la Tourette syndrome;Goals;Health Benefit;Human;In Vitro;Individual;International;Investigation;Journals;Lead;Link;Methods;Molecular;Motor Tics;National Institute of Mental Health;Nature;Neurites;Neurons;Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder;Parents;Pathologic;Peptide Sequence Determination;Phenotype;Point Mutation;Population;Prevalence;Process;Public Health;Publishing;Recurrence;Reporting;Research Design;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Rest;Sampling;Science;Scientist;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Site;Source;South Korea;Structure;Supervision;Testing;Time;Variant;Vocal Tics;Work;autism spectrum disorder;axonal pathfinding;base;biological systems;clinical research site;cohort;comorbidity;de novo mutation;disorder risk;effective therapy;exome sequencing;experience;functional genomics;gene discovery;genomic data;genomic locus;human genomics;in silico;induced pluripotent stem cell;induced pluripotent stem cell technology;insertion/deletion mutation;multidimensional data;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel;phenotypic data;proband;rare variant;recruit;risk variant;success;treatment strategy;variant detection","5/7-Collaborative Genomic Studies of Tourette Disorder","PROJECT NARRATIVETourette disorder (TD) is a poorly understood often debilitating developmental neuropsychiatric disordercharacterized by a combination of persistent vocal and motor tics affecting between 0.3 to 1% of peopleworldwide.

"Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTAt least 50% of patients treated with 125I brachytherapy for uveal melanoma experience significant vision losswithin 3-5 years after therapy. Extensive vascular pathology has been reported in the normal retinasurrounding the melanoma after 2 years or more. These findings are in line with the accepted but incompletelytested concept that microangiopathy causes radiation-related vision loss due to injury of the microvascularendothelium during radiation. This leads to progressive capillary loss after a lag period of several years. If thishypothesis is correct preventing the development of or treating radiation-induced endothelial damage inretinal microvessels will reduce capillary loss and save vision. However this approach has been difficult to testbecause early indicators of microvascular endothelial dysfunction have yet to be established.The objectives of the proposed project are to: facilitate earlier detection treatment and prevention of radiation-associated vision loss. Specifically we expect to 1. detect early endothelial dysfunction based on reducedblood flow and response to light flicker 2. determine whether it is predictive of subsequent capillary loss and 3.identify molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced endothelial dysfunction. We will apply laser speckleflowgraphy (LSFG) for noninvasive real-time imaging and measurement of ocular blood flow in humansubjects and mice to test our central hypothesis that post-radiation endothelial dysfunction is driven bymitochondrial oxidative stress and is predictive of the severity of subsequent capillary dropout andvision loss. We will test our hypothesis in two aims: Aim 1: Establish whether early impairment of themicrovascular endothelial function will predict microvessel drop-out and vision loss in humans after 125Ibrachytherapy. For this purpose LSFG optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A)and tests of visual function will be performed in a prospective cohort of patients undergoing 125I brachytherapyfor choroidal melanoma. We will test whether early impairment of ocular blood flow and flicker light-inducedvasodilation by LSFG correlate with subsequent vision loss and capillary drop-out (as detected by OCT-A). Aim2: Test whether selective inhibition of mitoROS production in endothelium prevents the early reduction of bloodflow and subsequent loss of capillaries after radiation. In this aim genetic mouse models in which keyregulators of mitochondrial superoxide production are inhibited or overexpressed will be used to test whetherinhibition of mitochondrial ROS in the endothelium protects from early impairment of retinal blood flowendothelial dysfunction and subsequent capillary dropout.The expected outcomes of the proposed studies are knowledge of biomarkers of early radiation retinopathyand insights into the role of endothelial-cell mitochondrial dysfunction in radiation retinopathy. Our studies havethe potential to facilitate the development of first-in-class targeted therapies for radiation-related vision loss.","Adult;Aftercare;Angiography;Animal Model;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Blood capillaries;Blood flow;Brachytherapy;Choroid Melanoma;Data;Development;Dropout;Early Diagnosis;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Eye;Eye diseases;Funding;Future;Genetic;Goals;Human;Image;Impairment;Infusion procedures;Injury;Knowledge;Lasers;Light;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mediator of activation protein;Methods;Mission;Mitochondria;Modality;Molecular;Mus;Non-Invasive Cancer Detection;Ocular Melanoma;Optical Coherence Tomography;Organ;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Pathology;Patients;Perimetry;Pilot Projects;Prevention;Production;Prospective cohort;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Radiation;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reporting;Research;Research Support;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Role;Seeds;Severities;Structure;Superoxides;Testing;Tissues;United States National Institutes of Health;Uveal Melanoma;Vasodilation;Vision;Visual Acuity;Visual impairment;base;choroidal circulation;cohort;density;early detection biomarkers;endothelial dysfunction;experience;genetic approach;human data;human subject;in vivo;insight;melanoma;mitochondrial dysfunction;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutics;overexpression;prevent;programs;prospective;radiation-induced injury;real-time images;response;retina circulation;retinal damage;standard care;targeted treatment","Laser speckle flowgraphy as early indicator of microvasculopathy in radiation-induced vision loss","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research aims at dissecting the mechanisms of vision loss in patients after treatment for uvealmelanoma and developing mechanism-based treatments.

Currenttreatments including factor VIII (FVIII) replacement and recent novel therapeutics focus primarily on jointhealth. In spite of advancements in treatment options disabilities remain. People with hemophilia suffer fromincreased rates of mental health disorders compared to age and sex matched controls (45% vs. 18.5%). Whilesignificant progress has been made in prevention and treatment of hemophilia-related joint and muscle diseasewith current standards of care there is a paucity of research in hemophilia A to understand treat or preventbrain disease. The long-term goal is to find diagnostic and treatment approaches that address the mechanismand structure of neurologic disease in hemophilia A. The objective of this proposal is to examine the role ofFVIII deficiency on neurologic function and structure. The central hypothesis is that cerebral microbleeds andneuroinflammation lead to changes in brain structure causing behavioral changes in hemophilia A mice. Therationale underlying this proposal is that completion will identify mechanisms causing poor neurologicoutcomes in hemophilia A. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1)Examine cerebral microbleeds and neuroanatomy phenotypes in hemophilia A mice. Aim 2) Investigate glialactivation and neuroinflammation in hemophilia A mice. Aim 3) Identify the role of FVIII replacement inneuropsychiatric behavioral phenotypes in hemophilia A mice. We will pursue these aims using innovativequantitative neuroimaging and gene transfer techniques to evaluate brain structure and function in hemophiliaanimal model over time.

It is wellestablished that after a vertebrate host is immunized with B. burgdorferi' OspA they produce antibodythat upon bloodmeal ingestion by a feeding tick kills B. burgdorferi within that tick. These are known astransmission-blocking vaccines (TBV). These tools including TBV have not been proven to decreaseB. burgdorferi exposure in critical intermediate incidental host(s). In North America both humans anddogs are incidental hosts of B. burgdorferi. We and others have demonstrated that dogs can serve asstand-in/proxies for human exposure to infected ticks. Hunting dogs are a robust model for this trialbecause they serve both as a proxy of an active outdoors incidental host (like people at high-risk ofcontracting LD) and are a conduit of ticks into domestic habitats increasing human exposure. The goalof this work is to demonstrate that a commercial-grade reservoir targeted TBV alters B. burgdorferiinfection prevalence in questing ticks in endemic areas (PA and MD) geographically distinct from thefirst field trial (NY). To show proof-of-principle for an ecological disruption of Borrelia transmission wepropose to: 1) establish the efficacy of a commercial-grade reservoir targeted transmission blockingvaccine (TBV) in reducing prevalence of B. burgdorferi in the tick vector and how it affects clinicaldisease in incidental hosts (dogs) in a five-year field study 2) Use a Bayesian hierarchical statisticalmodel to estimate how TBV treatment of infected ecosystems will alter human B. burgdorferi exposure.These proposed studies are highly significant to public health as a field trial demonstration of a TBVthat disrupts the enzootic transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi to incidental hosts. Furthermoredemonstration of reduced human (incidental host) Lyme disease will be performed through a stochasticBayesian model that will provide critical evidence for a new tool to decrease environmental exposure toLyme disease. This work innovates as a demonstration of an efficacious easily distributable andinexpensive TBV that reduces B. burgdorferi prevalence in nymphal and adult ticks as well as B.burgdorferi transmission from ticks to incidental hosts. Reduction of transmission of B. burgdorferi toincidental hosts as a result of TBV distribution will prove to be a paradigm-shifting strategy to reducethe burden of Lyme disease in veterinary and human populations. Findings from experiments proposedin this study will advance translational knowledge of B. burgdorferi vaccinology and will provide strongevidence regarding the possibility of TBV reducing the human health risk of exposure to Lyme diseaseacross the United States.","Adult;Affect;Antibodies;Area;Bayesian Modeling;Black-legged Tick;Borrelia;Borrelia burgdorferi;Borrelia burgdorferi Group;Canis familiaris;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Clinical;Contracts;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Ecosystem;Endemic Diseases;Environmental Exposure;Excision;Exposure to;Funding;Geographic Locations;Geography;Goals;Habitats;Health;Human;Immunize;Incidence;Infection;Ingestion;Intervention;Ixodes;Knowledge;Lyme Disease;Lyme Disease Vaccines;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;New York;North America;Nymph;Oral;OspA protein;Population;Prevalence;Prevention Measures;Proxy;Public Health;Publishing;Risk;Risk Factors;Seroprevalences;Statistical Models;Testing;Ticks;United States;Vaccination;Vaccines;Vector-transmitted infectious disease;Work;base;cohort;data modeling;disorder risk;enzootic;experimental study;exposed human population;field study;forest;high risk;human disease;innovation;predictive modeling;prevent;therapeutic vaccine;tick feeding;tick transmission;tool;transmission process;transmission-blocking vaccine;vaccine distribution;vaccine trial;vaccinology;vector tick","Field trial and modeling of transmission blocking vaccine to prevent Lyme disease","Narrative Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the leading cause of vector-borne infectious disease morbidity in the United States.

"Genetics; Human Genome","Maintaining genetic stability is of paramount importance for the survival of cells and organisms. Double-strandDNA breaks (DSBs) are the most lethal DNA lesion threatening genomic stability and cells have evolved avariety of mechanisms for their repair. While some of the repair mechanisms are accurate others are riskyand can further destabilize the genome leading to cancer and other diseases in humans. The molecularevents that draw the intermediates of otherwise accurate repair pathways into a maelstrom of destabilizingDNA repair mechanisms where these intermediates are then processed through risky DNA repair pathwaysremain unexplored. The goal of our research is to understand how DSB repair is channeled into the deleteriousrepair pathways with particular emphasis on three DSB repair phenomena: 1) break-induced replication (BIR)an unusual type of long-tract repair DNA synthesis that promotes bursts of genetic instabilities; 2)microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) a replicative pathway involving multiple template switching events atpositions of microhomologies that yields complex genomic rearrangements; and 3) the transformation of longsingle-strand DNA intermediates of DSB repair into toxic joint molecules promoting cell death. As a startingpoint we are using our dependable and powerful system in yeast where a single DSB is initiated by a site-specific HO endonuclease; we have demonstrated that all three of the repair events of interest can be used torepair the lesion in this system. The knowledge obtained using this system  the repair mechanismsintermediates participating proteins and mutation patterns  is used to inform the experimental design ofstudies that will evaluate these pathways in other yeast and mammalian systems. Conceptually the long-termgoals are the same across projects and involve three primary areas of inquiry. First using sensitive geneticapproaches proteins and DNA motifs whose presence affect the funneling of the repair intermediates into themaelstrom of destabilizing repair mechanisms will be identified. Second a combination of in vivo and in vitroapproaches will be used to model and investigate the cell's decision points to understand the circumstances(structures kinetics participating proteins etc.) that draw intermediates into high-risk and/or toxic repairpathways. Third the patterns of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements that result from the deleteriousrepair pathways will be evaluated and computational approaches will be used to apply these findings tohuman genome databases. To this end MMBIRFinder new software developed from previous research willbe used to detect complex genetic changes that cannot be found by currently available algorithms. Overall thisresearch program will bring improved clarity regarding the mechanisms of DNA repair intermediate processingwhich will uncover factors that influence the regulation of dangerous repair pathways and result indestabilization of the genome in eukaryotes.","Affect;Algorithms;Area;Automobile Driving;Cell Death;Cell Survival;Cells;Chromosomal Rearrangement;Complex;DNA;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Pathway;DNA Sequence Rearrangement;DNA biosynthesis;DNA lesion;Dangerousness;Development;Disease;Double Strand Break Repair;Eukaryota;Event;Experimental Designs;Genetic;Genome;Genome Stability;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;HO nuclease;Human;Human Genome;In Vitro;Joints;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lesion;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neurologic;Organism;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Plant Roots;Positioning Attribute;Process;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Role;Single-Stranded DNA;Site;Structure;Syndrome;System;Therapeutic Intervention;Work;Yeasts;genetic approach;genome database;high risk;human disease;improved;in vivo;interest;programs;repaired;software development","Double strand break repair maelstrom: causes mechanisms and genome destabilizing consequences","The relevance of complex genetic changes to many human diseases including cancer and many neurologicaland developmental syndromes is well established.

"Chronic Pain; Diabetes; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Peripheral Neuropathy","Project Summary / AbstractPresenting with chronic pain or loss of sensation peripheral diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a debilitatingcomorbidity of diabetes that affects at least half the diabetic patient population. Since only palliative treatmentsare available there is an urgent need for therapies that prevent or reverse the dying back degeneration ofperipheral axons in PDN. Recent evidence suggests that diabetes compromises mitochondrial structure andfunction in sensory neurons. However the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Mitochondrial shape is controlled by opposing fission and fusion events. Mutations in mitochondrialfusion enzymes cause neurological disorders that present similarly to neurological complications in diabeticpatients. Specifically mitofusin-2 mutations result in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A a peripheralneuropathy characterized by primary axon degeneration while mutations in Opa1 cause dominant opticatrophy the most common form of hereditary blindness. The mitochondrial fission enzyme dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is activated by dephosphorylation ofa highly conserved inhibitory PKA phosphorylation site. Two phosphatases target this site to promotemitochondrial fission the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and a neuron-specific and mitochondria-localized isoform of protein phosphatase 2A containing the B2 regulatory subunit (PP2A/B2). We generateda mouse knock-out (KO) of B2 and found elongated mitochondria in neurons consistent with deletion of aDrp1 activator. B2 KO results in a striking reduction in infarct volume following ischemic stroke indicating thatmitochondrial elongation is neuroprotective. Conversely knocking out A Kinase Anchoring Protein 1 (AKAP1)the protein that recruits PKA to the outer mitochondrial membrane to maintain Drp1 in a phosphorylated andinhibited state causes mitochondrial fragmentation and exacerbates stroke injury. Supported by preliminary evidence that B2 KO mice are resistant to peripheral neuropathy in bothtype-1 and type-2 diabetes models the present proposal seeks proof-of-concept evidence for B2 (and otheras yet undiscovered neuron-specific Drp1 activators) as a drug target for the treatment of PDN. We furtherpropose to investigate how diabetes causes mitochondrial fragmentation in sensory neurons and how inhibitingmitochondrial fragmentation protects peripheral axons in diabetes. Using new mouse models and innovative invivo imaging approaches we will test the overarching hypothesis that dysregulation of the mitochondrialfission/fusion equilibrium contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy and that inhibition of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission provides neuroprotection via improvement of mitochondrial metabolismreduction of ROS modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and enhanced regeneration of sensory axons.We anticipate that these studies will shed light on PDN etiology suggest new therapeutic strategies and thushelp improve quality of life for a rapidly growing diabetic population.","A kinase anchoring protein;Address;Affect;Afferent Neurons;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Apoptosis;Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy;Axon;Back;Biochemistry;Bioenergetics;Biogenesis;Calcineurin;Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diabetic mouse;Dynamin;Enzymes;Equilibrium;Etiology;Event;Face;Failure;Family;Generations;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;High Fat Diet;Homeostasis;Huntington Disease;Image;Impairment;Incidence;Infarction;Inherited;Injury;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Ischemic Stroke;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Lead;Light;Link;Mechanics;Mediating;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;Mutation;Natural regeneration;Nerve;Neural Conduction;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurologic;Neurons;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Numbness;OPA1 gene;Obesity;Outer Mitochondrial Membrane;PPP3CA gene;Palliative Care;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Peripheral;Peripheral Nerves;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphorylation Site;Population;Preparation;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein Isoforms;Protein phosphatase;Proteins;Quality Control;Quality of life;RNA Splicing;Reactive Oxygen Species;Resistance;Role;Scanning Electron Microscopy;Sensory;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Site;Skin;Spinal Ganglia;Streptozocin;Stroke;Structure;Testing;Transcription Factor AP-1;Variant;Viral;axon regeneration;axonal degeneration;calcineurin phosphatase;chronic pain;comorbidity;cytochrome c;density;diabetic;diabetic patient;electron tomography;hereditary blindness;imaging approach;improved;in vivo;in vivo imaging;innovation;leptin receptor;mitochondrial metabolism;mouse model;mutant;nerve supply;nervous system disorder;neuroprotection;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;oxidative damage;pandemic disease;patient population;prevent;recruit;sciatic nerve;socioeconomics;targeted treatment;trafficking;type I and type II diabetes","Targeting Mitochondrial Fission for Neuroprotection in Diabetic Neuropathy","Project NarrativeWith more than a third of the US population considered obese peripheral diabetic neuropathy a common anddebilitating neurological complication of diabetes has tremendous and rising socioeconomic impact.

"Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Minority Health; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARYDespite the development of new therapies cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life-shortening disease. Airway infec-tion and inflammation begin during infancy and lead to respiratory failure. Thus early interventions aimed atcorrecting the initial host defense defects and preventing/reducing infection could dramatically improve thecourse of CF lung disease. It is well known that mutations in the gene encoding CFTR a HCO  and Cl con- 3ducting channel cause CF. Yet the origins of CF lung disease have remained less well understood. We dis-covered that loss of CFTR impairs two important airway host defense mechanisms. a) Reduced activity of air-way surface liquid (ASL) antimicrobials. b) More viscous mucus that also has abnormal properties impairingits ability to detach from submucosal gland ducts thus hindering mucociliary transport (MCT). In both casesloss of CFTR-mediated HCO3 secretion and an abnormally acidic pH are key factors. Our long-term goal is todevelop novel therapeutics that target primary host defense defects due to loss of CFTR function. The overallobjective of this proposal is to determine if airway alkalinization with a repurposed drug can prevent or allevi-ate the development of CF airway disease. Our hypothesis is that airway alkalinization with tromethamine(THAM an FDA-approved alkalinizing agent in human clinical use for metabolic acidosis) will restore airwayhost defenses in CF and prevent/alleviate the development of CF airway disease. We found in humans andpigs that aerosolized THAM a tris-based non-bicarbonate buffer causes a sustained increase in ASL pH andthe effect lasts for hours in contrast to a much shorter duration with NaHCO3. THAM enhanced ASL bacterialkilling and decreased mucus viscosity. We test the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Does aerosolized THAMproduce a prolonged increase in ASL pH and enhance antimicrobial activity in pigs and humans? Based uponour published and unpublished data our working hypothesis is that aerosolized THAM will increase ASL pHand restore ASL antimicrobial properties in humans and pigs with CF. Aim 2. Will airway alkalinization im-prove MCT? From our earlier studies we postulate that airway alkalinization with THAM will reverse MCT de-fects in CF thereby enhancing MCT in CF. Aim 3. Does airway alkalinization alleviate or prevent early airwaydisease in CF pigs? Our published and preliminary data show that CF pigs already have airway host defensedefects present at birth and develop airway disease within 3 weeks of age. Thus we hypothesize that in CFpigs long-term restoration of ASL pH with THAM will improve airway host defense and lessen or prevent earlyairway disease in CF pigs. We are uniquely positioned to translate our recent discoveries on the pathogenesisof CF lung disease into a therapeutic intervention. These results from both human and preclinical animal stud-ies will be transformative for CF and likely other airway diseases. They will have an important positive impacton accelerating clinical development of THAM and other new therapeutic interventions and endpoints for earlyCF a critically important time point in the era of universal newborn CF screening.","Affect;Age;Airway Disease;Alkalinization;Animals;Bicarbonates;Birth;Buffers;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Duct (organ) structure;Early Intervention;FDA approved;Family suidae;Genes;Genetic Diseases;Gland;Goals;Host Defense;Host Defense Mechanism;Hour;Human;Impairment;Infection;Inflammation;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Lung diseases;Mediating;Metabolic acidosis;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mutation;Newborn Infant;Pathogenesis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Positioning Attribute;Property;Publishing;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Respiratory Failure;Rheology;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Translating;Tris-A;Tromethamine;Viscosity;Work;aerosolized;airway surface liquid;alkalinity;antimicrobial;base;clinical development;cystic fibrosis airway;drug repurposing;early cystic fibrosis;improved;infancy;injured airway;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;prevent;recurrent infection;restoration;screening;therapeutic development;therapeutic target","Airway Alkalinization and Repurposing Tromethamine as a Therapeutic Approach in Cystic Fibrosis","PROJECT NARRATIVECystic fibrosis is a common life-shortening genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure due torecurrent infections and chronic inflammation.

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Epilepsy; Lung; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention","AbstractSudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) occurs in up to 50% of patients with refractory epilepsy and isthe leading cause of death in this population. Because the mechanisms responsible for SUDEP have not beenclearly defined there are no specific treatments to prevent it. Recent observations from human and animalstudies indicate that seizure-induced respiratory arrest typically precedes asystole and that many patientsexperience varying degrees of respiratory depression following seizures. There is a fundamental gap inunderstanding how seizures depress respiration and why some patients develop severe postictal respiratorydepression and others do not. Low central CO2 chemosensitivity can contribute to respiratory depression andit is possible that this predisposes to SUDEP but has not been studied in this population. The long-term goal isto develop new treatments to prevent SUDEP by elucidating the mechanisms responsible for seizure-inducedrespiratory depression and by identifying biomarkers to identify patients at highest risk. The objective here is tocharacterize the relationship between CO2 chemosensitivity and postictal respiratory depression by measuringthe slope of the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) in patients with epilepsy during the interictal andpostictal states. The central hypothesis is that postictal hypoventilation will be more severe in patients with lowinterictal or postictal CO2 chemosensitivity. This hypothesis has been formulated based on human and animaldata obtained from the applicants own laboratories data that also suggest serotonin (5-HT) defects maycontribute to SUDEP. Because 5-HT neurons are known to be important for normal CO2 chemosensitivity thatstimulates breathing and cortical arousal the rationale for the proposed research is that defective chemo-sensitivity might contribute to the pathophysiology of SUDEP. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing3 specific aims. (1) Determine the relationship between baseline (interictal) central CO2 chemosensitivity andpostictal respiratory depression. (2) Determine how seizures affect central CO2 chemosensitivity. (3) Determinethe stability of the HCVR over time in patients with epilepsy and the relationship of the HCVR to epilepsycontrol. In Aims 1 and 2 patients admitted to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit will undergo HCVR testing during theinterictal and postictal periods. The slope of the baseline HCVR will be correlated with ictal changes in CO2levels and other cardiorespiratory variables (Aim 1) and the effect of different seizures on HCVR slope will bemeasured (Aim 2). The intraindividual variability of the HCVR and its stability in relation to epilepsy control (Aim3) will be determined by measuring the HCVR 4 times over 2 years. This approach is innovative because it isthe first to directly examine the relationship between postictal ventilation and central CO2 chemosensitivity inthe ictal and postictal states. The proposed research is significant because identifying the mechanismsinvolved in postictal respiratory depression may lead to identification of a novel biomarker (HCVR) for SUDEPrisk and to development of new treatments designed to defend ventilation in the postictal period.","Admission activity;Affect;Ambulatory Care Facilities;Animal Model;Animals;Arousal;Biological Markers;Breathing;Carbon Dioxide;Cause of Death;Cessation of life;Chemoreceptors;Clinic;Data;Defect;Development;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Focal Seizure;Functional disorder;Goals;Heart Arrest;Human;Hypercapnic respiratory failure;Individual;Inpatients;Intractable Epilepsy;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Measures;Mission;Monitor;Motor Seizures;Neurons;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Patients;Play;Population;Preventive treatment;Public Health;Research;Respiration;Risk;Role;Seizures;Serotonin;Temporal Lobe;Testing;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Ventilatory Depression;Work;animal data;base;candidate marker;experience;high risk;human data;innovation;novel;novel marker;patient biomarkers;prevent;respiratory;response;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy;therapy design;therapy development;ventilation","The role of central CO2 chemosensitivity in postictal respiratory depression and SUDEP","NarrativeSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractoryepilepsy.

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurosciences; Radiation Oncology","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]DOTATATE improves quality of life and survival inpatients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors; however objective tumor regression is infrequent and completeresponses are exceedingly rare. On the other hand exciting-emerging evidence suggests that PRRT withalpha-emitters has the potential to extend PRRT to tumor regression and even complete response. In thisstudy we propose to develop a new theranostic pair using [203Pb]PSC-TOC (imaging) / [212Pb]PSC-TOC (alphaemitter) for image-guided dosimetry based personalized therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. In Specific Aim 1of the proposal we will optimize the radiolabeling and production of [203/212Pb]PSC-TOC to prepare for its usein clinical trials and perform a preclinical dose escalation trial in immune-competent mice to investigate drugtoxicity and the relation of toxicity with radiation dose (using residence time as a surrogate) to the organs. Theaccurate measurement of radiation dose from alpha-emitters is challenging due to dependence of the dose onthe distribution of the radiopharmaceutical at cellular and subcellular level. In Specific Aim 2 we propose todevelop a surrogate for organ dosimetry based on the residence time of the radiopharmaceutical in a humanimaging trial with [203Pb]PSC-TOC This methodology requires serial imaging over multiple days. We will thenextend the dosimetry methodology to develop a predictive model to identify the best single imaging time pointthat predicts kidney accumulation similar to our previous work with 90Y-DOTATOC for translation of thedosimetry procedure into the clinical practice. Finally in Specific Aim 3 we will conduct a Phase 1 doseescalation trial of personalized dosimetry-guided therapy with [212Pb]PSC-TOC in patients with advanced stageNETs who have progressed or are refractory to conventional PRRT with beta emitters.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARYAll cells and organisms are subjected to mechanical forces. These forces are sensed by cell surface receptorssuch as the epithelial (E)-cadherin which links cells to their neighbors. E-cadherin responds to force byactivating signaling pathways inside the cell. These pathways trigger the formation of new cell-cell adhesionsand stimulate the rearrangement and reinforcement of the actin cytoskeleton. These actin cytoskeletalrearrangements are energetically costly. We recently discovered that the energy required to fuel thecytoskeletal rearrangements is provided by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a master regulatorof metabolism. It is activated when force is applied to E-cadherin and signals for ATP. The ATP produced fuelsthe cytoskeletal changes necessary for cells to resist external forces. Thus AMPK is mechanosensitive andlinks E-cadherin mechanotransduction to energy homeostasis. Using biochemical biophysical and cellbiological approaches in this proposal we will develop a paradigm for how mechanotransduction andmetabolism are coordinated. We will identify how: (1) glucose is taken up into the cell in response to force (2)metabolism and reinforcement of the actin cytoskeletal are spatially coordinated (3) different magnitudes offorce impact cell mechanics and (4) forces relayed from E-cadherin adjust global cellular metabolism. Throughthis work we intend to provide a fundamentally new picture of the interconnected pathways that governmechanotransduction. This new paradigm can be applied to better understand other mechanosensitivesystems. Additionally it will inform the nature of disease defects and define strategies to prevent metabolicdisturbances.","5&apos;-AMP-activated protein kinase;Actins;Biochemical;Biological;Biophysics;Cell Surface Receptors;Cell-Cell Adhesion;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Cytoskeleton;Defect;Disease;E-Cadherin;Glucose;Homeostasis;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mechanics;Metabolic;Metabolism;Molecular;Muscular dystrophy cardiomyopathy;Nature;Organism;Pathway interactions;Process;Protein Kinase;Psychological reinforcement;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;System;Work;cost;insight;mechanical force;mechanotransduction;prevent;response","Molecular Mechanisms Underlying E-cadherin Mechanotransduction","NARRATIVESeveral diseases are associated with changes in the response of cells to force and altered cell metabolism butlittle is known about how these two processes are coordinated.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Women's Health","Project Summary Vision loss from optic neuritis (ON) is a frequent consequence of autoimmune-mediated central nervoussystem (CNS) disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) andmyelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein associated disease (MOGAD). The severity of vision loss prognosis forrecovery response to therapy and risk of recurrence varies significantly between disorders; however ourunderstanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving these differences remain unclear. Reliable animalmodels that faithfully reproduce human MS- NMOSD- and MOGAD-specific pathology of the visual system aredesperately needed to advance our understanding of disease pathobiology and advance treatment. MS NMOSD and MOGAD are differentiated by the production of disease-specific pathogenicautoantibodies. We hypothesize that these disease-specific autoantibodies initiate distinctive patterns ofinflammatory optic nerve injury that clinically distinguish ON in MS MNOSD and MOGAD. We intend to developnovel models of MS NMOSD and MOGAD ON by delivering disease-specific monoclonal recombinantantibodies (rAbs) or serum IgG into the rat retrobulbar space using a novel surgical technique. Our long-termgoal is to generate transformative in vivo models of disease-specific antibody-mediated optic neuritis to advancetranslational research. In specific aim 1 we will measure the time course of functional impairment and inflammatory injury duringthe acute phase of autoantibody-driven optic neuritis. We will measure the anatomic and functionalconsequences of autoantibody-mediated optic neuritis in vivo using an array of tools that assess visual acuityretinal structure and electrophysiology. We will correlate our in vivo results to immunohistopathologicevaluations of complement deposition myelin loss and inflammatory cell infiltration in optic nerve tissue. In specific aim 2 we will quantify visual recovery and remyelination following autoantibody-driven opticneuritis. We will compare visual recovery and tissue repair in untreated and corticosteroid-treated animals usingfunctional and structural measurements. These studies will further validate disease-specificity by comparingrecovery in our animal ON models to those observed in their human counterparts. In vivo metrics will becorrelated with measures of tissue pathology remyelination and axonal injury. The development and validation of these novel disease-specific models of ON will significantly advance ourunderstanding of MS NMOSD and MOGAD ON pathobiology and provide an invaluable resource for futuretranslational and therapeutic studies.","Acute;Adrenal Cortex Hormones;Affect;Anatomy;Animal Experimentation;Animal Model;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antibodies;Astrocytes;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune;Automobile Driving;Axon;Blindness;Cells;Central Nervous System Diseases;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Characteristics;Clinical;Complement;Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity;Cytolysis;Demyelinating Diseases;Demyelinations;Deposition;Development;Disease;Disease model;Disease remission;Electrophysiology (science);Electroretinography;Encephalomyelitis;Epitopes;Evaluation;Frequencies;Future;Goals;Histologic;Histopathology;Human;Immune;Immunoglobulin G;Immunologics;Infiltration;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;Investigation;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Multiple Sclerosis;Myelin;Nerve Tissue;Neuraxis;Neuromyelitis Optica;Neurons;Oligodendroglia;Operative Surgical Procedures;Ophthalmology;Optic Nerve;Optic Nerve Injuries;Optic Neuritis;Optical Coherence Tomography;Outcome;Pathology;Patients;Pattern;Phase;Plasmablast;Production;Prognosis;Rattus;Recombinant Antibody;Recovery;Recurrence;Resolution;Resources;Retina;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Risk;Sclerosis;Serum;Severities;Specificity;Spinal Cord;Structure;Subarachnoid Space;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Studies;Time;TimeLine;Tissues;Translational Research;Validation;Vision research;Visual;Visual Acuity;Visual evoked cortical potential;Visual system structure;aquaporin 4;axon injury;central nervous system demyelinating disorder;functional disability;glial activation;immunopathology;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;injury and repair;injury recovery;innovation;multiple sclerosis patient;novel;oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein;pathogenic autoantibodies;prevent;remyelination;response;tissue injury;tissue repair;tool;translational study;visual dysfunction;water channel","In vivo modeling of autoantibody-induced optic neuritis","Project NarrativeOptic neuritis (ON) is a common manifestation of auto-immune demyelinating disorders such as mulitplesclerosis (MS) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoproteinassociated disease (MOGAD) and frequently results in permanent vision loss or visual dysfunction.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","AbstractGlaucoma is a heterogenous group of optic neuropathies and a leading cause of irreversible vision loss andblindness worldwide. Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma and is oftenassociated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) a leading causative risk factor for glaucoma. Elevated IOPis due to damage to the trabecular meshwork (TM) that increases resistance to aqueous humor outflow. Currentglaucoma treatments do not address the underlying primary pathophysiological mechanisms and the disordercan continue to progress despite treatment. To truly cure glaucoma there is critical need to permanently inhibitor reverse the glaucomatous damage to the TM and restore normal TM cell functions. New technologiesspecifically CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing allow investigators to directly modify the genes associated withpathogenic damage. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of targeting the mutant myocilin gene usingCRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to prevent and reverse glaucoma in myocilin-associated POAG in mice and inhuman donor eyes. It is our goal to develop genome editing methods targeting the TM for the treatment ofmyocilin-associated POAG and importantly the treatment of POAG in general. We have a unique opportunity tocure glaucoma by inhibiting the ongoing disease pathology by targeting common pathological pathwaysassociated with general POAG. We have previously linked the pathological role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress to the glaucomatous TM damage and IOP elevation in mouse models of ocular hypertension and in humandonor eyes. Specifically we have shown that ER-stress induced ATF4 and CHOP are associated withglaucomatous TM damage and independent inhibition of ATF4 and CHOP can be a novel treatment strategy forgeneral POAG. Therefore we propose to target this common underlying mechanism using the CRISPR-Cas9system. It is our overall goal to design AAV vectors encoding CRISPR/Cas9 targeting MYOC CHOP and ATF4to selectively knockout these genes in the TM and lower IOP in mouse ocular hypertension models as well asin ex vivo human perfusion organ cultured anterior segments. We hypothesize that genome editing knockout ofMYOC CHOP and ATF4 using AAV.CRISPR/Cas9 vectors targeting the TM will prevent and reverse elevatedIOP in glaucoma. We will use AAV vectors because these agents have been used for gene therapy in patientswith specific eye diseases. In this proposal we will first determine the most efficient AAV vector(s) for TM tropismand design efficient CRISPR/Cas9 constructs that effectively knockdown MYOC CHOP and ATF4 in the TM.We will also evaluate CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects in human donor eyes. Second we determine the efficacyof AAV.cr. MYOC AAV.cr. CHOP and AAV.cr. ATF4 knockouts in the TM and the ability of these knockouts toreduce elevated IOP in vivo in mice and ex vivo in human perfusion organ cultured anterior segments. Ourapproach will revolutionize glaucoma therapy by directly interfering with glaucomatous damage to the TM andprovide a one-time therapy to effectively treat glaucoma resulting from elevated IOP.","Age;Anterior;Anterior eyeball segment structure;Aqueous Humor;Blindness;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell physiology;Cells;Chemicals;Chronic;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Cytoskeleton;Deposition;Dexamethasone;Disease;Effectiveness;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Extracellular Matrix;Eye;Eye Development;Eye diseases;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Genes;Genetic;Glaucoma;Glucocorticoids;Goals;Heat shock proteins;Human;Iatrogenesis;In Vitro;Individual;Intervention;Knock-out;Link;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Mus;Mutation;Ocular Hypertension;Open-Angle Glaucoma;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Perfusion;Phenylbutyrates;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Primary Open Angle Glaucoma;Research Personnel;Resistance;Risk Factors;Role;Safety;Stress;System;Techniques;Technology;Time;Trabecular meshwork structure;Tropism;Viral Vector;adeno-associated viral vector;clinical application;cytokine;design;endoplasmic reticulum stress;extracellular;gain of function;gene therapy;genome editing;in vivo;insight;knock-down;knockout gene;mouse model;mutant;myocilin;new technology;non-genetic;novel;off-target mutation;optic nerve disorder;prevent;targeted treatment;therapeutic genome editing;treatment strategy;vector","Novel Genome Editing for the Treatment of Glaucoma","Project NarrativeThe successful completion of this project will lead to insights into disease mechanisms causing primary openangle glaucoma (POAG) including genetic and non-genetic forms of the disorder.

"Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Health Disparities; Infectious Diseases; Microbiome; Minority Health; Pediatric","ABSTRACT The microbial etiology of dental caries remains a subject of debate with considerable differences ofopinion regarding the relative contributions of specific species or classes of bacteria. The `low pH streptococci'is a designation given to atypical highly acidogenic strains of oral streptococci originally thought to belong to theprimary plaque colonizing species S. oralis S. mitis S. gordonii and S. anginosus. This sub-group ofstreptococci is proposed to have considerable cariogenic potential perhaps preceding augmenting or evenovershadowing the contribution of the mutans streptococci (MS). However assessing the role of the low pHstrep is not straightforward. Accurate assignment of species among the viridans streptococci is a challenge andthe low pH phenotype cannot be ascertained by the gene-based strategies routinely employed in non-culturebased studies of the oral microbiome. In this application we propose a unique prospective study that combinesstate-of-the-art bioinformatics with phenotypic analyses of low pH phenotypes to track changes in the plaquemicrobiome with a specific focus on the MS and non-MS low pH streptococci as caries develop in children athigh risk for early childhood caries. Specifically our objectives are to determine if there is ascendancy of non-MS low pH streptococci within the plaque oral microbiome with potential shifts in composition of other organismsduring the transition from a sound enamel site to a carious enamel site. In addition we propose a novel andexciting approach of categorizing low pH streptococci based on their potential to produce alkaline products. Webelieve that gaining a more comprehensive assessment of the low pH streptococcal species or taxa and ournovel grouping of these organisms based on alkaline-producing phenotypes as part of our determination of theplaque microbiome composition has the potential to make significant contributions to implementation science.To meet our objectives we propose the following aims: 1) Conduct an 18-month longitudinal study on high-cariesrisk children aged 1-3 to determine changes in the overall plaque microbiome preceding caries developmentwith a focus on the non-MS low pH streptococci; and 2) Use genomic sequencing to assign species identity ortaxonomical relatedness to the non-MS low pH streptococci recovered in Aim 1. By coalescing and analyzingthe data from the microbiome and low pH streptococci as caries develop we will define patterns or drivers ofcaries or health that may provide a basis for advances in implementation science.","Acid-Base Equilibrium;Age;Area;Bacteria;Bioinformatics;Carbohydrates;Child;Clinical;Data;Data Analyses;Dental Enamel;Dental Hygiene;Dental Plaque;Dental caries;Development;Ecology;Elements;Epidemiology;Equilibrium;Etiology;Experimental Designs;Genes;Genomics;Grouping;Health;Integration Host Factors;Iowa;Lead;Left;Lesion;Literature;Longitudinal Studies;Minority;Nutritional;Odontogenesis;Oral cavity;Organism;Outcome;Pathology;Pattern;Pediatric Dentistry;Phenotype;Population;Prevention;Property;Prospective Studies;Research;Research Priority;Risk;Risk Assessment;Role;Sampling;Scoring Method;Site;Streptococcus;Streptococcus Viridans Group;Streptococcus anginosus;Streptococcus gordonii;Streptococcus mitis;Streptococcus mutans;Streptococcus oralis;Subgroup;Taxonomy;Time;Uncertainty;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;aged;alkalinity;base;dietary;early childhood;exhaust;health disparity;high risk;high risk population;implementation science;improved;innovation;longitudinal analysis;member;microbial;microbiome;microbiome composition;novel;novel strategies;oral microbiome;oral plaque;oral streptococci;pediatric department;prospective;sound","Longitudinal Analysis of Low pH Streptococci and Plaque Microbiome in Early Childhood Caries","NARRATIVE A major influence on the development of dental decay is the composition of bacteria that comprise dentalplaque.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYCandida albicans is both a commensal component of the normal human microbial flora and an importanthuman pathogen. Although the commensal niches occupied by C. albicans are primarily limited to thegastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts candidal disease in contrast can involve a wide range of organsystems including kidney spleen liver heart eye the central nervous system and skin/mucosae. As such C.albicans is a versatile pathogen that adapts to a wide range of physiologically diverse environments within thehuman host. Understanding the systems that facilitate this adaptation is central to developing detailedmechanistic models of C. albicans pathogenesis and could inform the identification of new therapeuticapproaches to candidiasis. To date C. albicans transcription factors (TF) are the best characterizedcomponents of this system due in part to the availability of comprehensive sets of TF deletion mutants. Incontrast upstream regulators of C. albicans physiology such as protein kinases (PK) have not beensystematically studied to the same extent. To address this knowledge gap the long-term goal of our project isto systematically characterize the role of PKs in C. albicans pathobiology. As a first step toward this goal wepropose to: 1) generate and validate a barcoded set of homozygous and heterozygous C. albicans PK deletionmutants using a transient CRISPR/Cas9 strategy; 2) Systematically characterize the PK deletion mutants intwo murine model of candidiasis and two virulence relevant in vitro processes: biofilm and hyphae formation; 3)Identify and characterize the network of PK-TF pairs that regulate biofilm and hyphae formation using geneticinteraction analysis. Successful completion of these aims will provide a useful genetic resource for theresearch community provide the first systematic functional characterization of C. albicans PKs in vivo and invitro and set the stage for subsequent in-depth analyses of the genetic networks regulated by C. albicans PKs.","Address;Affect;Age;Antifungal Agents;Bar Codes;Biological Assay;CRISPR/Cas technology;Candida albicans;Candidiasis;Cell surface;Cells;Collection;Communities;Complex;Development;Disease;Disseminated candidiasis;Drug Targeting;Environment;Eye;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Heart;Human;Hyphae;In Vitro;Infection;Kidney;Knowledge;Libraries;Life;Liver;Mediating;Microbial Biofilms;Modeling;Mucous Membrane;Neuraxis;Organ;Pathogenesis;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Phosphoproteins;Physiological;Physiology;Process;Protein Analysis;Protein Dynamics;Protein Kinase;Research;Resources;Role;Skin;Spleen;System;Therapeutic;Virulence;Yeast Model System;base;body system;design;experimental study;fitness;genetic analysis;genetic resource;gut colonization;human pathogen;in vivo;inorganic phosphate;irritation;microbiota;mouse model;mutant;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;pathogen;pathogenic fungus;programs;transcription factor;urogenital tract","Systematic in vitro and in vivo genetic analysis of C.albicans protein kinases","PROJECT NARRATIVECandida albicans is one of the most common human fungal pathogens and affects all people of all agescausing disease ranging from superficial mucosal irritation to life threatening infections of critical organs.Currently there are limited therapeutic approaches to candidiasis and understanding the pathways thatmediate C. albicans survival in the host and its ability to cause disease is critical to developing newapproaches.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY: Halogenated compounds including legacy pollutants (e.g. chlorinated ethenes(CEs) polychlorinated biphenyls) and emerging contaminants (e.g. 123-trichloropropane) are frequently en-countered at Superfund sites. A common bioremediation strategy for halogenated pollutants in groundwaterand sediments is anaerobic reductive dehalogenation by organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB). Althougheffective OHRB-driven bioremediation strategies are often incomplete in field applications. An emerging reme-diation strategy involving amendment of pyrogenic carbonaceous matter (PCM; e.g. activated carbon (AC)) tothe subsurface offers a potential solution to problems with OHRB-driven bioremediation. Recent research high-lights the potential for PCM to promote synergistic interactions among OHRB and the auxiliary microbial com-munity and subsequently improve OHRB-driven bioremediation efficacy. However the underlying mechanismsof how PCM properties best support microbial network interactions and thereby enhance OHRB performanceand contaminant biodegradation remain unknown. These unknowns limit our ability to optimize OHRB perfor-mance in bioremediation strategies where PCM is used. This proposal is aimed at closing the knowledge gapconcerning specific surface effects of PCM on the performance of pollutant-degrading microorganisms espe-cially OHRB. The central hypothesis is that key PCM properties will shape microbial community structure anddrive the expression of metabolic functions associated with reductive dehalogenation processes. Elucidat-ing positive impacts between PCM and OHRB will allow for the development of tailored PCM that foster syner-gistic microbial network interactions and facilitate more effective and sustainable bioremediation. The hypothe-sis is based on preliminary data showing that OHRB-driven CE biotransformation performance was improvedin the presence of biochar OHRB were attached to carbon surfaces and that PCM-like tunable polymer net-works can be successfully synthesized. Guided by these preliminary data we will test the hypothesis by 1)providing a tunable platform for synthesis of PCM-like polymer membranes where surface charge and redox-active properties are varied individually 2) quantifying the effects of PCM surface properties on microbial net-work interactions and subsequent performance of an organohalide-respiring mixed culture and 3) developingtailored PCM for enhanced anaerobic bioremediation and contaminant mixture retention and validating materialperformance in microcosms. The proposed research is innovative because we will use a tunable platform tochange material surface properties and employ advanced molecular microbial ecology tools to assess the im-pacts of these properties on microbial community structure function and activity including OHRB. Outcomesof this project will benefit human health and realize economic benefits by reducing human exposure to halo-genated pollutants in the environment and demonstrating the potential for more effective and sustainable re-mediation approaches that combine tailored PCM and OHRB.","Address;Adsorption;Amendment;Anaerobic Bacteria;Bacteria;Behavior;Biodegradation;Bioremediations;Carbon;Charge;Data;Development;Ecology;Economics;Electron Transport;Engineering;Environment;Ethylenes;Exposure to;Fostering;Gene Expression;Goals;Growth Factor;Health;Human;In Situ;Individual;Industry;Knowledge;Lead;Mediation;Membrane;Metabolic;Metabolic Biotransformation;Methods;Microbe;Modeling;Molecular;Nutrient;Outcome;Oxidants;Oxidation-Reduction;Performance;Phase;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Polymers;Process;Production;Property;Research;Sampling;Shapes;Structure;Superfund;Surface;Surface Properties;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Toxic effect;aqueous;base;cofactor;dechlorination;dehalogenation;design;exposed human population;ground water;improved;innovation;materials science;member;microbial;microbial community;microbiota;microorganism;microorganism interaction;monomer;novel;pollutant;programs;remediation;response;success;superfund site;synergism;tool","Elucidating mechanisms for enhanced anaerobic bioremediation in the presence of carbonaceous materials using an integrated material science and molecular microbial ecology approach","PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will develop and optimize novel engineered carbon materials thatsimultaneously enhance the performance of organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) and sequester otherpollutants that are recalcitrant or inhibitory to OHRB.

"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Genetics; Neurosciences; Sleep Research","Project SummarySleep deprivation presents an increasing threat to individual health and public safety as well as an economicburden due to lost productivity traffic accidents occupational accidents and skyrocketing healthcare costs.There has been an astonishing rise in the number of individuals affected by sleep deprivation withapproximately 35% of U.S. adults and a staggering 70% of teenagers reporting insufficient sleep. Sleepdeprivation induces significant impairments in memory and performance aggravates psychiatric andneurological disorders and increases disease risk especially neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimersdisease. Given the significant number of people affected by sleep deprivation and the potentially devastatingconsequences of sleep loss in terms of disease and dementia it is essential to identify the cellularconsequences of sleep deprivation and to define the specific molecular targets and processes impacted.Recent research suggests that the influence of acute sleep deprivation on memory occurs at the cellular andsynaptic level although the specific mechanisms through which sleep deprivation exerts these effects remainpoorly understood. The hippocampus a critical brain region for memory is particularly susceptible to theeffects of acute sleep deprivation. Previously we found that sleep deprivation decreases protein synthesis inthe hippocampus leading to impairments and deficits in synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that sleepdeprivation targets multiple processes that affect the regulation of gene expression which is comprised ofchanges in transcription RNA processing and localization and protein synthesis. The objectives of thisproposal are to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which sleep deprivation impacts generegulation and to define the affected subregions and cell types within the hippocampus. In Specific Aim 1 wefocus on the signaling pathways through which sleep deprivation affects protein synthesis to adversely impactlong-term memory and synaptic plasticity with a focus on identifying mechanisms of resilience to sleep loss. InSpecific Aim 2 we investigate the effects of sleep deprivation on RNA fate at the subcellular level andexplicitly detail the effects of sleep deprivation on the pool of mRNA available for translation. In Specific Aim3 we employ state of the art techniques to define the impact of sleep deprivation across subregions within thehippocampus and within individual cell types providing a detailed spatial map and cellular signature of theeffects of sleep deprivation. The results from our comprehensive proposal integrating in vivo behavioralmanipulations to mitigate the effects of sleep deprivation on memory the subcellular analysis of the effects ofsleep deprivation on RNA fate and protein synthesis and the identification of cell specific signatures of sleepdeprivation will provide significant insights into the negative impacts of sleep deprivation on memorypotentially leading to the development of therapeutics to counteract the consequences of sleep loss oncognition and neurodegenerative disorders.","Acute;Adult;Adverse effects;Affect;Affinity Chromatography;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Animals;Area;Behavior Control;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Brain region;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Chronic;Cognition Disorders;Cognitive deficits;Dementia;Development;Disease;Economic Burden;Event;FRAP1 gene;Foundations;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Health;Health Care Costs;Hippocampus (Brain);Impaired cognition;Impairment;In Situ;Individual;Learning;Maps;Mediating;Memory;Memory impairment;Mental disorders;Messenger RNA;Molecular;Molecular Target;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Nuclear;Nuclear RNA;Occupational Accidents;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Performance;Phosphorylation;Plant Roots;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Productivity;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Synthesis Inhibition;Proteins;Public Health;RNA;RNA Processing;RNA Splicing;RNA Transport;RNA-Binding Proteins;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Ribosomes;Safety;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Sleep Deprivation;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Techniques;Technology;Teenagers;Testing;Traffic accidents;Transcript;Translating;Translations;Viral;age related;base;cell type;cognitive function;cognitive performance;disorder risk;excitatory neuron;hippocampal subregions;improved;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;insight;long term memory;memory process;negative affect;nervous system disorder;novel therapeutics;overexpression;regional difference;relating to nervous system;resilience;therapeutic development;therapy development;transcriptome sequencing","Mechanistic Studies on the Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Gene Regulation","Project NarrativeSleep deprivation is a rapidly growing public health concern impacting millions of Americans and causingsignificant impairments in memory and cognitive performance impairments that have been shown to aggravatenumerous psychiatric and neurological disorders including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimersdisease.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Macular Degeneration; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human","AbstractAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of blindness worldwide that is characterized bypathologic changes at the retinal pigment epithelium-choriocapillaris interface. We recently found that loss ofendothelial cells of the choriocapillaris is related to the earliest clinical signs of AMD and that a reducedvascular density and increased number of ghost vessels are related to the size and number of drusen andother subRPE deposits. Compelling evidence suggest that activation of the terminal complement pathway andformation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) at the level of the choriocapillaris is a likely cause ofvascular loss and AMD pathogenesis.In this proposal we seek to identify the molecular and cellular responses of choroidal endothelial cells injuredby MAC; to evaluate small molecules that protect choroidal endothelial cells against MAC-mediated lysis; andto develop an autologous iPSC based choroidal endothelial cell replacement approach.We anticipate that completion of the aims outlined in this application will result in an important newunderstanding of disease pathophysiology which will allow us to further develop treatments focused onprotecting and replacing damaged blood vessels in AMD.","Affect;Age related macular degeneration;Animal Model;Atrophic;Autologous;Biochemical;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Bruch&apos;s basal membrane structure;Cell Death;Cell physiology;Cells;Choroid;Clinical;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Coculture Techniques;Complement;Complement Factor H;Complement Membrane Attack Complex;Cytolysis;Deposition;Disease;Drusen;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Eye;Functional disorder;Funding;Genotype;Goals;Health;Hemorrhage;Histologic;Human;Imaging Techniques;Imidazole;Immune;Individual;Injections;Injury;Knowledge;Lead;Macular degeneration;Mediating;Methods;Molecular;Nonexudative age-related macular degeneration;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Photoreceptors;Physiological;Play;Preventive treatment;Public Health;Research;Retina;Risk;Role;Structure;Structure of retinal pigment epithelium;Vision;base;blood damage;cell injury;complement pathway;density;genome editing;geographic atrophy;high risk;induced pluripotent stem cell;injured;macula;novel;programs;repaired;response;restorative treatment;risk variant;small molecule;stem cells;treatment strategy;vascular bed","Choriocapillaris protection and replacement in AMD","NarrativeAge-related macular degeneration is a common devastating disease that can lead to blindness.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Foodborne Illness; Health Disparities; Health Effects of Indoor Air Pollution; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health","PROJECT SUMMARY - COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT COREBecause of their proximity to agriculture and agribusinesses rural people have significant exposures tobioaerosols organic dust and allergens; agricultural pesticides and farm chemicals; and antibiotic-resistantpathogens from the livestock industry. The Community Outreach and Engagement Core at the University ofIowa EHSRC seeks to assist rural populations by disseminating and translating relevant environmentalhealth research conducted within the Center. In 2015 the EHSRC COEC conducted a needs assessment in which many of the environmental healthissues identified by Iowa communities were related to rural life exposures including Water QualityConcentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) Land Use Food Safety Radon Metals and HealthyHomes. The Center and COEC have conducted research and community engagement on many of theseissues and will continue to do so going forward. Additionally the COEC will continue to build upon its established successes. Our Environmental HealthWorkshops for Midwest Legislators have served as a model for other centers to replicate and modify and wewill continue to work with our partners at NCSL and the American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest tocarry these into the future. The Science Caf series we established in 2013 has been well received in ruralIowa communities and the COEC will work to bring high-quality relevant science to these communities in theyears to come. We will remain active in radon research and translation through our affiliations with the IowaRadon Coalition and engaged in disseminating the latest information on climate change and human health tolegislators the lay public and the scientific community. Our team will continue to provide training and technicalassistance to Center members and scientists undertaking community research. Finally we have increased ourinvolvement in disaster preparedness by partnering with the Iowa Flood Information System on the inclusion ofpublic health information working with public health professionals on a training video for flood responders. Through these efforts toward delivering science and technology-based information to meet the needs of ourscientists communities and stakeholders the EHSRC COEC remains an integral and integrated part of theCenter.","Address;Agriculture;Allergens;American Lung Association;Animal Feed;Area;Chemicals;Chronic Disease;Communities;Community Outreach;Competence;Disasters;Dust;Educational Activities;Educational workshop;Ensure;Environmental Health;Event;Exposure to;Farming environment;Floods;Food Safety;Future;Grant;Health;Health Professional;Home;Human;Industry;Information Systems;Iowa;Knowledge;Life;Livestock;Medical;Metals;Methods;Midwestern United States;Modeling;Needs Assessment;Outreach Research;Policies;Poverty;Privatization;Provider;Public Health;Radon;Readiness;Research;Research Activity;Rural;Rural Community;Rural Population;Science;Scientist;Series;Technology;Training;Translating;Translations;Uninsured;Universities;Urban Health;Water Supply;Work;agricultural pesticide;base;climate change;community based participatory research;community engagement;drinking water;drug resistant pathogen;experience;health science research;land use;member;operation;outreach;rural Americans;rural area;rural dwellers;rural health disparities;success;toxic metal;water quality","Community Outreach and Engagement Core","n/a","NIEHS","10146862","4/1/2021","RFA-ES-16-001","5P30ES005605-31","5","P30","ES","005605","31","","","4/1/1997","6/16/2022","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","6820","6437531","PARKER, EDITH A","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2021","3/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","147418"," ","98184","49234"," "," ",

"Biomedical Imaging; Complementary and Integrative Health; Lung","PROJECT SUMMARY  INTEGRATIVE HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY The overall goal of the Integrative Health Sciences Facility (IHSF) is to encourage support and enhance clinical and translational studies relevant to environmental health sciences. In addition through our state-of- the-art imaging facility we provide investigators with cutting edge technology to evaluate and analyze effects of ambient air pollutants on lung structures. This technology can be applied to small animals such as rodents large animals such as pigs and humans promoting translation of basic discoveries related to environmental exposures to humans. To accomplish this goal the IHSF will 1) Provide the infrastructure to carry out clinical and translational studies relevant to environmental health sciences; 2) Ensure that clinical and translational studies are carried out safely and that subject confidentially is maintained; 3) Provide the infrastructure for training of young clinical/translational investigators with an interest in environmental health sciences; and 4) Support EHSRC investigators who utilize the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) and promote new multidisciplinary research collaborations. The facility services are focused on three main areas: recruitment evaluation and assessment of research subjects. To support these areas we have a Research Subject Recruitment and Interactions Component Imaging Component Cardiopulmonary Physiology Component and Biologic Sampling Component. The IHSF facilitates the use of University of Iowa resources specifically the ICTS Clinical Research Unit the Cardiovascular Human Physiology Laboratory the ICTS Core Analytical Laboratory the ICTS Research Safety Office and the Clinical Bronchoscopy Suite. In future initiatives we will support the infrastructure to enhance collaboration between diverse researchers (from the Colleges of Public Health Medicine Engineering Pharmacy and Liberal Arts and Sciences) with a common interest in environmentally and genetically influenced inflammatory-associated lung pathologies including COPD asthma cystic fibrosis occupational lung diseases and cancer. We are developing an informatics service to harmonize lung-imaging protocols throughout the University of Iowa Healthcare Network so that we can rapidly expand our imaging database and its utility for research studies.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vocal communication is a vital aspect of human life. This complex behavior requires integration of the auditory feedback produced during speaking to optimize ongoing vocal production. Significant public health burden arises when vocal communication and the requisite sensorimotor integration occurring during vocalization are impaired. For example diseases such as stuttering aphasia schizophrenia and autism are felt to involve disordered sensorimotor integration. In order to develop better treatments for the millions of Americans suffering from these common diseases it is necessary to understand the functional organization of the vocal sensorimotor brain network.  Previous studies in other species suggest two parallel systems of vocal production- one involving anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and one involving the laryngeal motor cortex (LMC). The functions of each of these areas and the connectivity between them are not known in humans. We will utilize complementary experimental techniques in human neurosurgery patients to overcome long-standing barriers of research progress and improve our understanding of the role of ACC and LMC in the vocal sensorimotor network.  Our techniques will include functional brain imaging (MRI) high-resolution direct brain recordings and reversible perturbation of cortical function through brain stimulation and cooling to define ACC LMC and auditory cortical vocalization-related physiology. We will also delineate the network connectivity between these regions. These techniques will test our hypotheses that ACC and LMC are critical to predictive coding and error detection and correction mechanisms involved in vocal control.  To our knowledge this data will be the first of its kind to directly define and test human ACC and LMC vocalization-specific responses. Such knowledge will provide mechanistic insights that cannot be obtained using other techniques and will guide development of new treatments of impaired vocal communication.","Address;Affect;American;Anatomy;Anterior;Aphasia;Apraxias;Area;Attenuated;Auditory;Auditory area;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain imaging;Characteristics;Clinical;Code;Communication;Complex;Data;Detection;Development;Disease;Dysarthria;Electric Stimulation;Epilepsy;Etiology;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Histologic;Human;Impairment;Individual;Knowledge;Larynx;Learning;Life;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Methods;Modeling;Monkeys;Motor;Motor Cortex;Motor Pathways;Pathologic;Patients;Pattern;Physiology;Play;Process;Production;Property;Public Health;Quality of life;Research;Resolution;Role;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Site;Speech;Structure;Stuttering;System;Techniques;Testing;Work;auditory feedback;auditory processing;autism spectrum disorder;behavioral response;cingulate cortex;design;experimental study;human subject;improved;insight;neuromechanism;neurosurgery;nonhuman primate;novel;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;relating to nervous system;response;tumor;vocal control;vocalization","Neural mechanisms of vocal communication in the human brain","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired vocal communication is common and reduces quality of life for millions of Americans.

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Lung; Osteoporosis; Prevention","This translational study seeks to establish a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)-specific fractureprediction model using our unique computed tomography (CT)-based assessment of peripheral bone micro-architecture. Osteoporosis a common comorbidity among patients with COPD accelerates morbidity andmortality. The basis for this comorbidity is poorly understood thus the need for characterizing the link betweenCOPD-related factors and bone micro-architecture and their association to fracture-risk. Multiple COPD-relatedfactors are associated with osteoporosis. Different COPD-related causes of bone loss may non-uniformly impactcortical and trabecular bone structures with varying mechanical consequences reflective of divergent COPD-associated fracture-risk in individuals with similar bone mineral density (BMD). Little is known about this linkageand our goal is to fill this knowledge gap using a clinically suitable emerging CT-based tool for characterizationof bone micro-architecture at peripheral sites. Specifically this study will(1) establish the generalizability of ourbone micro-architecture assessment applied to emerging low dose / high resolution CT scanners from differentvendors; (2) assess its potential as compared to dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to explain prevalentfractures and predict incident fractures among patients with COPD; (3) quantify the impact of different COPD-related factors on bone structures and their implications for fracture-risk; (4) identify COPD subtypes with rapidbone structural degeneration; and (5) develop a COPD-specific model for assessment of fracture-risk usingpatient-specific data. We will take advantage of(1) existing COPD patient cohorts with lung characterization atthe University of Iowa (UI) and Columbia University (CU) representing a wide demographic range; (2) access toemerging CT scanners at both sites; and (3) unique image processing methodologies for quantifying three-dimensional bone structural metrics. We will recruit 470 COPD patients from the UI and CU cohorts and 80 age-sex-similar never-smoker controls. At baseline and 3-year follow-up visits we will collect(1) data related to riskfactors; (2) a lateral spine CT scout scan to assess vertebral fractures; (3) high resolution CT scans of the ankleand wrist for computation of bone structural metrics; and (4) whole-body spine and hip DXA. Siemens Force CTscanners will be used for all participants except for 100 randomly-selected patients and controls from the UIcohort who instead will be imaged via a Toshiba Aquilion ONE 320 scanner. This study will establish anemerging CT-based scanner-independent generalizable tool to assess bone response to different therapeuticinterventions aimed at slowing or reversing bone loss and possibly restoring bone structure potentially leadingto more patient-specific interventions. Also this study seeks to explain the relationships among various COPD-related factors bone structural changes and their implications for fracture-risk. Finally a COPD-specific modelfor assessment of fracture-risk will be developed that will utilize patient-specific demographic clinical andradiographic data and CT BMD at the spine as well as bone structural measures at the wrist and/or ankle.","3-Dimensional;Age;Agreement;Ankle;Architecture;Area;Bone Density;Bone structure;Characteristics;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Clinical;Computed Tomography Scanners;Data;Development;Diagnostic radiologic examination;Distal;Dose;Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry;Fracture;Glucocorticoids;Goals;High Resolution Computed Tomography;Hip region structure;Image;Incidence;Individual;Intake;Intervention;Iowa;Knowledge;Lateral;Link;Lung;Measures;Mechanics;Methodology;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Osteoporosis;Participant;Pathology;Patients;Performance;Peripheral;Phenotype;Physical activity;Population;Porosity;Prevalence;Radial;Risk;Risk Factors;Rod;Scanning;Site;Skeleton;Spinal Fractures;Structure;Subgroup;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Thick;Training;Universities;Vendor;Vertebral column;Visit;Weight-Bearing state;Wrist;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;bone;bone loss;bone strength;cohort;comorbidity;cortical bone;disorder subtype;follow-up;fracture risk;histological studies;image processing;lumbar vertebra bone structure;mortality;never smoker;predictive modeling;pulmonary function;recruit;response;sex;spine bone structure;substantia spongiosa;systemic inflammatory response;thoracic vertebra bone structure;tibia;tool;translational study","CT-Based Modeling of Bone Micro-Architecture and Fracture-Risk in COPD","The goal of this translational study is to establish a newly emerging CT-based tool for the characterization ofchanges in bone micro-architecture and assessment of their implications for fracture-risk in a population of COPDpatients at risk for osteoporosis.

Animal models robustlysupport that endurance exercise protects brain areas vulnerable to aging such as the hippocampus andthat these benefits lead to better learning. In contrast there are mixed findings from human studies onthe cognitive benefits of exercise with healthy older adults. This contrast indicates we still do notunderstand how exercise could change the course of cognitive decline in aging adults. However nohuman studies have comprehensively tested exercise effects on cognition in older adults with learningtasks inspired from basic exercise neuroscience. Our objective in the proposed research is to fill thistranslational gap by determining if exercise improves the same kinds of learning in older adults that havebeen shown to improve in animal models by improving hippocampal function. This will bring us closer toour long-term goal of determining how exercise protects the brain from adverse effects of aging in orderto develop interventions that minimize age-related cognitive decline. Our overall hypothesis is thatexercise improves learning when it increases functional hippocampal-cortical communication thatotherwise declines with aging. We will test this in a sample of healthy older adults by determining ifincreases in functional hippocampal-cortical connectivity from moderate intensity exercise improvelearning on an array of tasks that require the hippocampus for acquisition of new relational memories butnot in tasks that do not require the hippocampus to learn such as motor or response learning. We furtherpursue mechanistic insight on the direct effects of exercise by determining if individual differences in therapid effects of moderate intensity exercise on hippocampal-cortical connectivity predict training-relatedchange in connectivity and learning and by determining if training-related changes in cardiorespiratoryfitness are a critical factor. Our results will be significant because early prevention has the biggest impactand determining how exercise counteracts mechanisms of cognitive aging leads to understanding howsuch plasticity is possible and informs prevention strategies. The proposed work is innovative becausewe test how exercise affects cognition by bringing together conceptually advanced measures ofhippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes with novel conceptualizations for how tocapture the physiological changes induced by exercise that change hippocampal-cortical connectivity.Because hippocampal connectivity deteriorates with Alzheimer's results could also lead to anunderstanding of the mechanisms by which exercise reduces risk of this devastating and costly disease.","Acute;Adult;Adverse effects;Affect;Age-associated memory impairment;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease related dementia;Animal Model;Animals;Area;Automobile Driving;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain region;Cardiac;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive aging;Communication;Complex;Cost of Illness;Data;Detection;Deterioration;Elderly;Exercise;Exercise Test;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Growth;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Hour;Human;Impaired cognition;Individual Differences;Intervention;Lead;Learning;Life;Long-Term Effects;Measures;Memory;Metabolic;Modality;Motor;Neurosciences;Onset of illness;Pathway interactions;Physical Exercise;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Population;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Process;Randomized Controlled Trials;Research;Risk;Sampling;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Training;Translating;Work;age effect;base;cardiorespiratory fitness;cognitive benefits;cognitive function;cost;endurance exercise;exercise intensity;exercise training;healthy aging;improved;innovation;insight;light intensity;memory process;novel;predicting response;relating to nervous system;relational memory;response;success;trial comparing","Exercise to improve hippocampal connectivity and learning in older adults","Project NarrativeGiven the accelerating growth of older adults worldwide and the decline in cognitive function with agingtherapeutics that remediate age-related cognitive decline are needed more than ever.

"Cardiovascular; Contraception/Reproduction; Estrogen; Genetics; Hematology; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human; Women's Health","Strong epidemiological evidence links pre-menopausal estrogen exposure to increased risk of venousthrombosis in women particularly during pregnancy in the immediate postpartum period and in women takingestrogen-containing oral contraceptives (OCP). This proposal addresses a significant knowledge gap linkingestrogens with platelet activation. Studies in the past have focused on how estrogens alter the hemostatic andfibrinolytic system. This proposal which focuses on platelets represents a productive collaboration betweenthe Universities of Iowa and Utah. Our preliminary studies in the Framingham cohort and in pregnant humansreveal increased platelet OPA1 levels in females that predict risk of coronary artery disease or correlate withincreased platelet activation in the third trimester of pregnancy. In platelet-deficient OPA1 knockout (KO) micewe discovered that female OPA1KO mice were protected from thrombosis compared to males. Thethrombosis phenotype was reversed after oophorectomy. Based on these preliminary findings we hypothesizethat OPA1 and regulators of OPA1 activity OMA1 and YMEL1 modulate platelet activation in anestrogen-dependent manner and OPA1 levels in platelets predict estrogen modulated plateletactivation. To address this hypothesis in the R61 phase Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms forestrogen-mediated and OPA-1-dependent modulation of platelet activation using mice with platelet specificOPA1 deletion and will generate OMA1 and YMEL1 platelet specific KO mice with increased OPA1 activity.Aim 2 will determine platelet OPA1 OMA1 and YMEL1 expression and correlate expression levels to plateletactivation in the setting of pregnancy and OCP use. We will also develop a human iPSC model system togenerate MKs to determine if estrogen directly regulates the expression of these genes. The R33 phase willdissect the molecular mechanisms linking increased OPA1 with platelet activation in females. Aim 1 willperform detailed physiological and molecular phenotyping of murine platelets isolated from OMA1 and YMEL1KO and OPA overexpressing transgenic mice. In addition we will examine the mechanisms linking increasedOPA1 activity mitochondrial energetics and platelet activation. Aim 2 will complement animal studies byexamining changes in mitochondrial function and signaling in platelets from pregnant women and women onOCPs. We will genetically ablate OMA1 and YMEL1 from iPSC-derived MKs to directly test if estrogenmodulates MK and platelet function in an OPA1 dependent manner. By integrating in vivo and in vitro studiesin humans and mouse models our approach is translational innovative and highly responsive to the RFA.These studies will determine for the first time whether increased estrogen exposure in pregnancy and OCP usereprogram MKs and developing platelets to increase thrombotic complications and identify novel mechanismsfor this increased risk. The impact of these studies is that they may identify novel biomarkers that may predictincreased risk of thrombosis in susceptible females during pregnancy or prior to OCP use.","Address;Animal Model;Animals;Bioenergetics;Biological Models;Blood Platelets;Collaborations;Complement;Complex;Contraceptive Usage;Coronary Arteriosclerosis;Coronary heart disease;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Epidemiology;Estrogen Replacements;Estrogens;Exhibits;Exposure to;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Gene Expression;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Hemostatic Agents;Hormones;Human;Impairment;In Vitro;Inner mitochondrial membrane;Iowa;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Link;Mediating;Megakaryocytes;Membrane Proteins;Messenger RNA;Metalloproteases;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Morphology;Mus;OPA1 gene;Optic Atrophy;Oral Contraceptives;Ovariectomy;Participant;Patients;Pattern;Peptide Hydrolases;Phase;Phenotype;Physiological;Platelet Activation;Platelet aggregation;Postpartum Period;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Premenopause;Proteins;Recording of previous events;Risk;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;System;Testing;Third Pregnancy Trimester;Thrombosis;Time;Transcript;Transgenic Mice;Universities;Utah;Venous Thrombosis;Woman;Work;Zinc;base;cohort;genetic manipulation;human model;human pluripotent stem cell;human subject;in vivo;in vivo Model;indexing;induced pluripotent stem cell;innovation;male;metabolomics;molecular phenotype;mouse model;next generation;novel;novel marker;overexpression;pill;platelet function;platelet phenotype;pregnant;programs;recruit;response;sex;thrombotic;thrombotic complications;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;venous thromboembolism","OPA1 an Estrogen-Mediated Modulator of Platelet Hyperactivation","NarrativePregnant women or women on oral contraceptives are at increased risk for venous thromboembolism likelydue to dynamic changes in estrogen levels.

"Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Human Genome; Pediatric; Prevention","Orofacial clefting (primarily cleft lip and/or cleft palate) is a relatively common structural birthdefect with environmental and genetic contributions to etiology. Genome wide associationstudies (GWAS) and linkage studies have identified many gene variants that are associated withelevated risk for isolated oral facial clefting (OFC). However our understanding of thepathogenic mechanisms underlying this disease remains poor because one we have yet todistinguish DNA variants that directly influence risk for OFC (i.e. causal variants) from thosethat are merely in linkage disequilibrium with them and two the functions of the regulatorymolecules encoded y OFC-associated genes in craniofacial development are largely unknown.At each locus there are multiple identified multiple SNPs that are statistically associated withOFC  and all of these reside in non-coding DNA. In Aim 1 we will prioritize the SNPs forfunctional tests by performing fine mapping of GWAS data and identifying de novo mutations innew whole genome sequence data from 800 case-parent trios. In Aim 2 we propose to identifythe OFC-associated SNPs that are functional (causal). We hypothesize that pathogenic SNPsreside in enhancers that drive expression in oral tissues and that risk alleles of such SNPsquantitatively affect activity of the enhancers. To test this hypothesis we will amplify genomicDNA containing risk-associated SNPs and test them for allele-dependent enhancer activity invitro (cell-based reporter assays). We will also test the tissue specificity of the enhancers(zebrafish and mouse-based reporter assays). In Aim 3 we will determine the effect thataltering the allele of pathogenic SNPs has on expression of the relevant OFC-risk gene(genome engineering with CRISPR/Cas9 in vitro). Finally we apply chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromatin configuration capture in the oral epithelium cell line to deduce themechanism by which functional SNPs change expression of the OFC-risk genes. The expectedoutcome of the proposed experiments is identification of the mechanisms by which genetic riskvariants cause a common birth defect.","Address;Affect;Alleles;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;CRISPR/Cas technology;Catalogs;Cell Line;Cells;Chromatin;Cleft Lip;Cleft Palate;Cleft lip with or without cleft palate;Congenital Abnormality;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Diagnostic;Disease;Elements;Embryo;Engineering;Enhancers;Epithelial Cells;Etiology;Face;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Risk;Genetic Variation;Genome Mappings;Genome engineering;Genomic DNA;Genotype;Human;In Vitro;Lead;Linkage Disequilibrium;Live Birth;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Monitor;Morphogenesis;Mus;Oral;Outcome;Parents;Pathogenicity;Physiology;Precipitation;Regulatory Element;Reporter;Risk;Series;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Structural Congenital Anomalies;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Transgenic Organisms;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Zebrafish;base;causal variant;chromatin immunoprecipitation;cost;craniofacial;craniofacial development;de novo mutation;design;experimental study;fetal;genetic variant;genome wide association study;genomic locus;improved;in vitro Assay;in vitro activity;in vivo;oral cavity epithelium;oral tissue;orofacial cleft;promoter;rare variant;risk variant;success;tool;transcription factor;whole genome","Functional tests of non-coding DNA variants associated with risk for orofacial clefting","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and linkage studies have identified manyDNA variants that are associated with elevated risk for isolated oral facial clefting acommon birth defect.

Although hearing aids (HAs) are the primary intervention for the management ofage-related hearing loss only 1530% of those who could benefit from HAs actually seek them out. HAadoption rates are even worse for people with lower income and for racial and ethnic minorities. One of themost commonly reported reasons for people not seeking HA intervention is the high cost of HAs and theassociated audiological fitting services. Because HAs fitted using the audiologist-based service-delivery model(AUD model) are unaffordable more and more Americans (1.5 million in 2010) purchase amplification devicesvia over-the-counter service-delivery models (OTC models) to compensate for their impaired hearing. Although OTC amplification devices are gaining popularity and are regarded as an important option forpromoting accessible and affordable hearing healthcare it is unclear if they are viable solutions for age-relatedhearing loss as OTC models exclude professional services. Further if there are outcome differences betweenAUD and OTC models it is unknown if the clinical improvement in outcomes will be offset by the improvedvalue (outcome relative to cost) or if it is possible to identify appropriate candidacy for each model to ensureoptimal patient care for all. Finally no prior research has investigated if hybrid service-delivery models inwhich professionals provide streamlined services to fit OTC amplification devices offer affordable and qualityamplification interventions as has been recently advocated. The overall goal of this project is to characterize the differential effect of service-delivery models onprovision of amplification so that accessible and affordable hearing healthcare can be facilitated. This projectproposes to conduct research that would provide new knowledge about the outcome value and candidacyof OTC hybrid and AUD models and the effect of professional evaluation/selection services patient-centered services and device-centered services on outcome and value. The proposed study will acquirethis knowledge through a two-site double-blinded randomized controlled field trial. The results obtained willinform patients and hearing healthcare providers about what can be achieved with different service-deliverymodels and will help us develop guidelines to facilitate the selection of the most appropriate and cost-effectiveintervention for a particular patient. The significance of the proposed project from the public health point of viewis that it will facilitate not only accessible and affordable but also quality hearing healthcare.","Adoption;Adult;Advocacy;Advocate;American;Behavioral;Clinical;Communication;Cost Effectiveness Analysis;Counseling;Data;Devices;Double-Blind Method;Ear;Ensure;Evaluation;Frequencies;Goals;Guidelines;Health Personnel;Healthcare;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Hearing Tests;High Prevalence;Human;Hybrids;Individual;Intervention;Knowledge;Learning;Low income;Measures;Mission;Modeling;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders;Outcome;Patient Care;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Personality;Practice Management;Presbycusis;Procedures;Professional Role;Public Health;Quality of life;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Reporting;Research;Service delivery model;Services;Site;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;amplification device;base;cognitive function;cost;cost effective;cost effective intervention;design;ethnic minority population;hearing impairment;improved;outcome prediction;patient oriented;psychosocial;racial minority;randomized controlled study;response;self diagnosis;yeast two hybrid system","Cost-effective hearing aid delivery models: Outcomes value and candidacy","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed project is relevant to public health because the knowledge gained from the project willdirectly facilitate accessible affordable and quality hearing healthcare and improve amplification interventionoutcomes.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","Abstract Environmental exposure to neurotoxic pesticides has been increasingly recognized as a key etiologicalfactor of sporadic Parkinsons disease (PD). Despite the established link deciphering the neurotoxicologicalmechanisms associated with chronic pesticide exposure and its role in the etiopathogenesis of PD has beenchallenging. Thus our research proposal intends to explore a novel paradigm in environmentalneurotoxicology by studying the acetylation of histone proteins during pesticide exposure using animal modelsof pesticide neurotoxicity. Among various classes of pesticides exposure to mitochondria-impairing neurotoxicpesticides e.g. rotenone has been linked to the etiology of PD. Mechanistically exposure to rotenone andanother related pesticide pyridaben inhibits mitochondrial complex-1 and impairs proteasomal function inneuronal cells. Dopaminergic neurons have been shown to be highly vulnerable to rotenone-inducedneurotoxicity. While studying proteasomal dysfunction in mitochondria-impairing pesticide-inducedneurotoxicity we unexpectedly discovered that rotenone- and pyridaben-induced proteasomal inhibitionresulted in the accumulation of the major histone acetyltransferase enzyme CBP (CREB-binding protein)which further contributed to acetylation of histones H3 and H4 to promote apoptotic cell death in dopaminergicneurons. Since hyperacetylation of histones is emerging as a key molecular mechanism capable of producinglong-term changes in gene expression profiles due to chromatin remodeling we propose to explore this novelmechanism in the molecular events underlying nigral dopaminergic neuronal damage in chronic mitochondria-impairing pesticide-induced neurotoxicity models. This work will be accomplished by pursuing the followingspecific objectives: i) Map the hyperacetylation sites of core histones H3 and H4 in dopaminergic neuronalcultures following mitochondria-inhibiting neurotoxic pesticide exposure ii) Characterize cellular mechanismsof pesticide-induced hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 by examining the contributions of various isoformsof histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) and iii) Determine histone acetylationpattern in chronic rotenone or pyridaben animal models of pesticide neurotoxicity as well as in a progressivemitochondrial dysfunction-induced transgenic mouse model of PD confirm the changes in acetylation patternsand HAT/HDAC homeostasis in human PD brain tissues and define the functional significance of histonehyperacetylation-dependent signaling relevant to neurotoxic pesticide-induced neuronal degeneration. Cellularmolecular and neurochemical approaches will be used to delineate these objectives. Collectively the proposedstudy represents a novel approach in pesticide neurotoxicological research since the work will provide acomprehensive understanding of the histone hyperacetylation mechanisms pertaining to environmentally-induced nigral dopaminergic neuronal toxicity as it relates to the etiopathogenesis of environmentally-linked PD.","1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium;Acetylation;Address;Animal Disease Models;Animal Model;Animals;Apoptotic;Attenuated;Autopsy;Brain;Brain Diseases;CREBBP gene;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chronic;Complex;Data;Dieldrin;Disease;Dopaminergic Cell;Dose;Environmental Exposure;Enzymes;Epigenetic Process;Etiology;Event;Exposure to;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Genes;Goals;Histologic;Histone Acetylation;Histone Deacetylase;Histone H3;Histone H4;Histones;Homeostasis;Human;Impairment;Link;Lysine;Maps;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurologic Symptoms;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Oxidative Stress;Parkinson Disease;Parkinsonian Disorders;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pesticides;Process;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Public Health;Research;Research Proposals;Risk;Role;Rotenone;Signal Transduction;Site;Slice;System;Time;Tissues;Transgenic Animals;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Ubiquitin;Work;brain tissue;chromatin remodeling;dopaminergic neuron;gain of function;genome-wide;histone acetyltransferase;histone modification;inhibitor/antagonist;knock-down;mitochondrial dysfunction;mitopark mouse;mouse model;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;mutant;neurochemistry;neurotoxic;neurotoxicity;neurotoxicology;nigrostriatal system;novel;novel strategies;pesticide exposure;pesticide induced neurotoxicity;toxicant","Novel Mechanisms of Pesticide-Induced Neurotoxicity","Narrative Chronic exposure to mitochondria-impairing neurotoxic pesticides is a major public health problemaround the world and has been linked to many disease conditions including Parkinsons disease.

"Chronic Pain; Pain Research","Project SummaryVoltage-gated ion channels shape electrical signals in excitable cells. There are now high-resolution structuresof eukaryotic sodium potassium and calcium channels thus providing structural footprint to guide functionalhypotheses. In the previous funding period we discovered a dynamic region the pore region of Shakerpotassium channels which suggest that state-dependent hydrogen bonding controls the conductionconformation of the channel. These observations have recently been structurally and computationallyvalidated. Further computational studies indicate that the status of this H-bond network and thus theconductive state of the channel are coupled to channel opening at the inner bundle crossing though side-chainto main-chain bonding network along the pore-lining S6 segment. Additionally voltage gated channels remainhigh-value pharmacological targets and the sodium channel Nav1.7 isoform underlies pain sensation. Geneticloss of Nav1.7 abrogates pain sensing in humans as do adult Nav.17 conditional knock-out animal models.Aryl- and acylsulfonamide compounds target the domain IV (DIV) voltage-sensing domain (VSD) ofperipherally expressed sodium channels such as Nav1.7 with low nanomolar affinity and attenuateinflammatory and neuropathic pain. A structure of the human Nav1.7 DIV VSD in complex with GX-936 apotent arylsulfonamide suggests that these compounds utilize a unique binding mode whereby the drugsimultaneously binds within an aromatic pocket and engages a basic residue (R4) of the activated voltage-sensor. These compounds are useful research tools to advance the understanding of NaV inactivation giventhe role of the DIV VSD in this process. Further advancing the chemical details of this drug-bound pose willenable the design of compounds specific activity towards other voltage-sensors. Voltage-gated calciumchannels are established drug targets of dihydropyridines (DHP) and recently the binding site was captured ina structure of a bacterial chimeric CaVAb  an engineered channel construct with nanomolar DHP bindingaffinity. However it is not known if this bacterial chimera faithfully replicated the binding chemistry of theeukaryotic CaV. Not having predictive information on the basis for CaV antagonism severely limits the potentialto develop of more critical methods for preclinical screens of therapeutics. The successful execution of these aims will advance the molecular understanding of channel gatingand will reveal the binding modes of clinical drugs with high therapeutic value. Further research toolsgenerated here in will be similarly available to the ion channel research community.","Adult;Affinity;Agonist;Amino Acids;Animal Model;Attenuated;Binding;Binding Sites;Biology;Biophysics;Calcium;Calcium Channel;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cations;Cells;Chemicals;Chemistry;Chimera organism;Clinical;Communities;Competitive Binding;Complement;Complex;Comprehension;Coupled;Derivation procedure;Development;Dihydropyridines;Drug Antagonism;Drug Targeting;Engineering;Event;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Human;Hydrogen Bonding;Ion Channel;Ion Channel Gating;L-Type Calcium Channels;Magic;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Mutagenesis;Neurons;Nifedipine;Pain;Pattern;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Potassium Channel;Process;Property;Protein Isoforms;Research;Resolution;Role;Shaker potassium channel;Shapes;Side;Signal Transduction;Site;Sodium Channel;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;base;biophysical techniques;clinically relevant;computer studies;conditional knockout;design;improved;inflammatory pain;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;interdisciplinary approach;interest;knockout animal;member;nanomolar;pain sensation;painful neuropathy;pre-clinical;sensor;tool;unnatural amino acids;voltage;voltage gated channel","Chemical Biology of Voltage-Gated Cation Channels","NarrativeThe goal of this competitive renewal project is to describe hydrogen bond networks in potassium channels andto advance the chemical basis for understanding neuronal sodium channel inhibition by acyl- andarylsulfonamide compounds.

"Aging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Women's Health","Project Summary/AbstractStiffness of the large elastic central arteries (e.g. aorta and carotids) increases with advancingage and is a robust predictor of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among olderadults. The age-related increase in central artery stiffness is associated with a concomitant risein systolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse pressure (PP) and subsequently the development ofisolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in many older adults. Consequently higher PP results ingreater pulsatile pressure and flow penetrating into high blood flow organs such as the braincausing subclinical target organ damage. Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) also increases withadvancing age and is associated with cardiovascular target organ damage including leftventricular hypertrophy and intima-medial thickness (IMT) of peripheral conduit arteries but itremains unclear whether enhanced SNA modulates the age-related increase in central arterystiffness and associated augmented carotid pressure and flow pulsatility and increased IMT.Therefore the objectives of this application are to 1) determine the contribution of SNA to theage-related increase in aortic stiffness and reduced carotid compliance and augmented carotidpressure and flow pulsatility and IMT among older adults with ISH and 2) determine theeffectiveness of chronic inhibition of SNA for reducing large artery stiffness carotid pressureand flow pulsatility and IMT among older adults with ISH. In Aim 1 we will enroll 30 older (age60-85 years) adults (50% women/50% men) with untreated stage 1 or stage 2 ISH (systolic BP130-159 mmHg; diastolic BP <90mmHg) in a repeated measures experimental study assessingaortic stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity PWV) and carotid artery compliance andpressure pulsatility index at baseline and during -15 and -30 mmHg of lower body negativepressure. We hypothesize that acute experimental elevations in SNA will result in transientincreases in carotid-femoral PWV and decreases in carotid compliance resulting in highercarotid pressure and flow pulsatility. In Aim 2 we will enroll 78 healthy older men and women(age 60-85 years) with untreated or treated ISH in a randomized placebo-controlled doubleblind study. We hypothesize that 4 weeks of chronic SNA inhibition with oral clonidine will resultin clinically meaningful decreases in aortic stiffness and increases in carotid artery compliancecausing significant reductions in carotid pressure and flow pulsatility index and IMT. Theproposed research will fundamentally advance our understanding of the regulation of largeelastic artery stiffness by SNA among older humans with ISH and provide valuable insight intoSNA as a novel therapeutic target among older adults with ISH for lowering CVD risk.","Acute;Adult;Age;Aging;Aorta;Arteries;Attenuated;Blood Pressure;Blood flow;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Carotid Arteries;Central Artery;Cessation of life;Chronic;Clinical;Clonidine;Collagen;Data;Development;Diastolic blood pressure;Double-Blind Method;Elastin;Elderly;Enrollment;Event;Goals;Human;Hypertension;Isolated systolic hypertension;Left Ventricular Hypertrophy;Lower Body Negative Pressure;Measures;Medial;Mediating;Myocardial Infarction;Nerve;Oral;Organ;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physiologic pulse;Placebos;Publishing;Pulse Pressure;Randomized;Regulation;Research;Smooth Muscle;Stroke;Structure;Thick;Woman;age related;aged;arterial stiffness;arteriole;calcification;cardiovascular disorder risk;cerebrovascular;effectiveness evaluation;experimental study;hemodynamics;hypoperfusion;indexing;insight;men;middle age;muscle hypertrophy;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutic intervention;older men;older women;prehypertension;pressure;therapeutic target;white matter damage","Sympathetic Regulation of Large Artery Stiffness in Humans with Age-Related Isolated Systolic Hypertension","Project NarrativeElevated large artery stiffness with aging contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) events such asmyocardial infarction stroke and CVD death in part from isolated systolic hypertension (ISH (i.e. increasedsystolic but not diastolic blood pressure).

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) defined as an enlarged left ventricle with systolic dysfunction is a leading causeof heart failure and cardiac transplantation. Sudden cardiac death accounts for ~35% of deaths in DCM ofwhich a significant number of the reported cases are triggered by episodes of emotional stress. Additionallythe incidence of DCM is three times greater in men than women with reduced levels of androgens associatedwith poor outcomes in men with heart diseases. Despite the high prevalence and health burden little is knownabout the underlying mechanisms that lead to the unexpected premature mortality in DCM especially in males.The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) is a key cardiovascular forebrain nucleus thatmediates the stress response under normal conditions and contributes to the overactivity of the sympatheticnervous system in heart failure. Angiotensin II (AngII) the excitatory component of renin-angiotensin system(RAS) and proinflammatory cytokines acting within the brain contribute to the neurohumoral excitation cardiacremodeling and myocardial electrical instability in heart failure. Our robust preliminary results indicate thatacute stress induced by social defeat decrease blood pressure evoke ventricular arrhythmias and lead tosudden death in male but not female sarcoglycan delta deficient (Sgcd-/-) mouse model of DCM. Thus ourcentral hypothesis is that in DCM the effects of emotional stress are superimposed upon a basal state ofneurohumoral excitation which differ according to sex. We propose that while increased sympathetic outflowwould normally cause hypertension in DCM males with compromised cardiac function and reduced cardiacoutput it results in hypotension arrhythmias and sudden death. We will further determine how the reducedandrogens in the DCM males contribute to their vulnerability while estrogens in the DCM females protectagainst stress-induced mortality. We will test these novel hypotheses with state-of-the art physiological andmolecular approaches in the ubiquitous and cardiac-specific Sgcd-/- mice in the following two specific aims. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that stress-induced augmentation of RAS activity and inflammation in the PVN precipitates an exaggerated neurohumoral response in males with DCM leading to hypotension arrhythmias and sudden death. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the sex hormones modulate RAS activity and inflammation in the PVN contributing to the increased susceptibility of males with DCM to stress-induced sudden death.These studies will define underlying mechanisms of stress-mediated sudden death in male mice with DCMand identify novel therapeutic target(s) that will enable discoveries from basic science to be translated intoclinical practice for dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.","Acute;Adrenal Glands;Androgens;Angiotensin II;Anterior Pituitary Hormones;Argipressin;Arrhythmia;Autonomic Dysfunction;Basic Science;Blood Pressure;Brain;Cardiac;Cardiac Output;Cardiovascular system;Case Study;Catecholamines;Cause of Death;Cell Nucleus;Cessation of life;Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone;Data;Diagnosis;Dilated Cardiomyopathy;Dissociation;Emotional;Emotional Stress;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogens;Female;Functional disorder;Genetic;Genetic Models;Glucocorticoids;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Transplantation;Heart failure;High Prevalence;Hypertension;Hypotension;Hypothalamic structure;Incidence;Inflammation;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-6;Lead;Left ventricular structure;Mediating;Molecular;Mus;Myocardial;Nerve;Outcome;Patients;Pharmacology;Physiological;Predisposition;Premature Mortality;Prosencephalon;Renin-Angiotensin System;Role;Stress;Sudden Death;Sympathetic Nervous System;TNF gene;Techniques;Testing;Testosterone;Time;Translating;Ventricular Arrhythmia;Woman;acute stress;base;biological adaptation to stress;clinical practice;clinically relevant;cytokine;delta Sarcoglycan;heart function;male;men;mortality;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;paraventricular nucleus;precision medicine;response;sex;social defeat;sudden cardiac death","Stress-induced cardiovascular dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathy","PROJECT NARRATIVEDilated cardiomyopathy is one one of the leading causes of heart failure and heart transplantation with suddendeath occurring in approx. 50% patients primarily men within 5 years.

For decades physicians and scientists havedreamed of preventing vision loss in patients affected with an inherited retinal disease via some form of genereplacement therapy. Thus it is not surprising that the recent clinical success of AAV-mediated geneaugmentation for the treatment of early stage RPE65-associated disease has been tremendously excitingproviding a new level of confidence that this approach will also be useful for the treatment of other recessiveand X-linked disorders. However AAV-mediated gene augmentation is not likely to be effective as a stand-alone treatment for the large population of patients with dominantly inherited diseases that result frommutation dependent formation of a toxic protein product (i.e. gain of function variants).To treat dominant gain of function diseases correction of the mutant allele or suppression of the abnormaltranscript will be required. Recent advances in the field of CRISPR-based genome editing have shown greatpromise for such applications. For instance in a recent study we demonstrated how the subretinal injection ofa CRISPR/Cas9 construct could be used to disrupt the disease-causing Pro23His rhodopsin allele at the DNAlevel in pig retina via nonhomologous end joining (NEHJ). Unfortunately the efficiency of disease alleledeletion was significantly lower than that required to have a clinically significant effect. In response to this poorefficiency (and the fact that off-target effects are a real concern with in vivo genome editing) we have decidedto focus this renewal application on very recently developed CRISPR-based approaches to suppresstranscription and cleave specific mRNAs rather than permanent DNA modification. These newly developedapproaches are significantly less likely to induce deleterious off-target genomic modifications than traditionalCRISPR-based strategies. Likewise as these approaches do not require DNA cleavage and repair they have thepotential to be significantly more efficient in turn making them more suitable for in vivo applications.The CRISPR-based approaches outlined in this application will be tested in patient-specific iPSC-derivedretinal organoids in vitro and the Pro23His rhodopsin mutant pig in vivo. The studies in this proposal willevaluate the feasibility of using this new dimension of CRISPR biology for the treatment of autosomaldominant retinal diseases.","Affect;Alleles;Amino Acids;Biology;Blindness;CRISPR interference;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Cleaved cell;Clinical;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;DNA;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Modification Process;Degenerative Disorder;Dimensions;Disease;Disease Progression;Dreams;Early treatment;Family suidae;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Guide RNA;Hereditary Disease;Human;In Vitro;Inherited;Light;Link;Location;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Modification;Mutation;Natural regeneration;Neural Retina;Nonhomologous DNA End Joining;Nonsense Codon;Organoids;Patients;Photoreceptors;Physicians;Prevention;Proteins;RNA;RPE65 protein;Reading Frames;Retina;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Diseases;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Rhodopsin;Scientist;System;Testing;Transcript;Variant;Vitelliform macular dystrophy;base;clinically significant;disease phenotype;effective therapy;gain of function;gene replacement;gene replacement therapy;gene repression;genome editing;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;inherited retinal degeneration;mutant;novel;nuclease;patient population;prevent;programs;repaired;response;subretinal injection;success;treatment strategy","CRISPR-Cas9 based treatment of dominant retinal degeneration","NarrativeIn this proposal we will utilize novel CRISPR-Cas9 approaches to develop strategies for treatment of thedominantly inherited retinal degenerative disorders rhodopsin-associated retinitis pigmentosa and Bestdisease.

"Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases","Project Summary:Chronic stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR) drives T cells to progressively lose their ability to exerttheir effector functions in a process termed exhaustion. T cell exhaustion occurs during both cancer andpersistent infections contributing to the failure of the adaptive immune response to control the tumor orinfection. CD8 T cell exhaustion was initially described during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus(LCMV) infection. However CD4 T cells control the delicate balance between the maintenance of effector CD8T cell responses versus the development of CD8 T cell exhaustion during chronic infection. Despite theircritical role in maintaining the antiviral CD8 T cell response much less is known about the specific signalingdefects and metabolic changes that occur within exhausted CD4 T cells. Gene expression studies examiningLCMV-specific CD4 T cells have indicated that hundreds of genes are differentially expressed between CD4 Tcells isolated during an acute versus chronic LCMV infection and that these genetic changes are different forCD4 T cells versus CD8 T cells. Many of the differentially expressed genes in CD4 T cells are related to TCRsignaling and metabolic pathways but how these alterations lead to specific defects in TCR signaling andcellular metabolism has not been defined. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that mediateCD4 T cell dysfunction during chronic viral infections and cancer progression. The objective of this applicationis to determine the specific defects in CD4 T cell signaling and metabolic pathways that develop during chronicLCMV infection. Our central hypothesis is that virus-specific CD4 T cells develop multiple defects in criticalsignaling pathways downstream of the TCR and metabolic pathways resulting in the impaired ability of theCD4 T cell to mediate effector activity and proliferate during a chronic viral infection. Our hypothesis is basedour own preliminary data in conjunction with published genetic studies indicating that expression of multiplesignaling and metabolic proteins are reduced in virus-specific CD4 T cells following a persistent LCMV Clone13 infection. The rationale for the proposed research is that once the principal signaling and metabolic defectsaffecting exhausted CD4 T cells are identified new and innovative therapeutic approaches can be targeted torestore CD4 T cell effector activity and enhance clearance of chronic viral infections and human cancers. Wewill achieve the goals of this proposal by pursuing the following two specific aims: 1) Examine the effects ofviral exhaustion on early TCR signaling and function in CD4 T cells and 2) Investigate the impact of viralexhaustion on metabolism in CD4 T cells. The completion of these aims will determine if T cell exhaustion afterinfection with a chronic virus results in CD4 T cell intrinsic changes in the signaling capacity and metabolicfunction that would impact effector functions. Our results will provide insight into the molecular mechanism ofCD4 T cell exhaustion and highlight potential avenues to modulate either signaling or metabolism to enhancethe function of exhausted CD4 T cells during either chronic viral infection or cancer immunotherapy.","Acute;Address;Affect;Antiviral Agents;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cell physiology;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chronic;Collaborations;Complex;Data;Defect;Development;Distal;Equilibrium;Exhibits;Exploratory/Developmental Grant;Failure;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Generations;Genes;Genetic study;Goals;Human;Immune System Diseases;Immune response;Impairment;Infection;Investigation;Laboratories;Lead;Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Memory;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolism;Mission;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Pathogenesis;Play;Process;Proliferating;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Receptor Signaling;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;T Cell Receptor Signaling Pathway;T cell response;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Viral;Viral Cancer;Virus;Virus Diseases;Work;adaptive immune response;base;burden of illness;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;chronic infection;differential expression;effector T cell;exhaust;exhaustion;experience;innovation;insight;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;prevent;receptor function;response;tumor;tumor progression","CD4 T cell intrinsic signaling defects during viral exhaustion","Project Narrative:Some viruses and human cancers have evolved mechanisms that inhibit critical aspects of the immuneresponse that prevent effective elimination of the infection or malignant cell.

"Biodefense; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia & Influenza","PROJECT SUMMARYInfluenza remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality and current therapies have limited efficacy.Respiratory failure in influenza results from either prolonged viral replication or lung injury induced by anover exuberant immune response. It follows that a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulatethe host immune response to IAV could lead to new therapies. Effector CD8+ T cells are responsible forclearance of influenza A virus (IAV) during primary infection but have also been implicated in immune-mediated lung injury. Effector CD8+ T cells also give rise to influenza-specific CD8+ tissue resident memoryT cells (Trm) which mediate heterosubtypic immunity decreasing the severity of subsequent IAV infection.Thus the magnitude and quality of the CD8+ T cell response to IAV must be tightly controlled to achieveviral clearance limit immune-mediated lung injury and promote the formation of tissue-resident memory.Dendritic cells (DC) activate nave T cells in the lymph node to generate an effector CD8+ T cell responseinteract with effector CD8+ T cells within infected lung to promote viral clearance and attenuateimmunopathology and are required for the generation of optimal CD8+ Trm. Thus DC play a critical role inregulating both effector CD8+ T cells and in the formation of protective memory. Effector CD8+ T cells arealso regulated by inhibitory (i.e. checkpoint) receptors. T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim3)is an important checkpoint receptor that is induced on activated T cells and constitutively expressed onDC. Tim3 modulates the immune response to IAV but it is not known whether it constrains viral clearanceor protects from lung injury. We previously demonstrated Tim3 attenuates effector CD8+ T cell responsesand protects against mortality in a mouse model of IAV. We now have data demonstrating that Tim3promotes antigen cross presentation by DC  a process critical for generating both effector and tissueresident memory CD8+ T cells in IAV infection. Our central hypothesis is that Tim3 determines thebalance between viral clearance and lung injury and promotes the formation of CD8+ Trm. In Aim #1 wewill test the hypothesis that Tim3 promotes antigen cross presentation by DC and DC-mediated activationof naive CD8+ T cells during IAV infection. Specifically we will (A) identify the intracellular mechanismsutilized by Tim3 to promote cross presentation (B) characterize the expression and function of Tim3 onhuman lung DC and (C) determine the role of Tim3 on lung DC in activating nave CD8+ T cells during IAVinfection. In Aim #2 we will test the hypothesis that Tim3 promotes viral clearance and attenuates immune-mediated lung injury during IAV infection and promotes IAV-induced CD8+ Trm formation. Experiments inthis aim will A) define the effect of Tim3 in regulating effector CD8+ T cell responses in the lung during IAVinfection and (B) determine the role of Tim3 in IAV-induced CD8+ Trm formation. These experiments area critical first step toward developing Tim3 as a therapeutic target for influenza.","Acute;Affect;Antigens;Antiviral Agents;Attenuated;Blocking Antibodies;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Cessation of life;Conflict (Psychology);Cross Presentation;Data;Dendritic Cells;Disease;Equilibrium;Generations;Goals;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunoglobulins;Impairment;Infection;Influenza;Influenza A virus;Lead;Lung;Mediating;Memory;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucins;Mus;Outcome;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Play;Primary Infection;Process;Regulation;Research;Respiratory Failure;Role;Serotyping;Severities;Signal Transduction;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Viral;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;base;cell type;checkpoint receptors;experimental study;genetic regulatory protein;immune checkpoint;immunopathology;improved outcome;influenza infection;lung injury;lymph nodes;mortality;mouse model;neutralizing antibody;novel;novel therapeutics;prevent;respiratory;respiratory virus;response;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool","Regulation of the host immune response to influenza by the checkpoint receptor Tim3","PROJECT NARRATIVEDuring influenza infection regulation of anti-viral T cells is necessary to promote clearance of the virus andprevent injury of the lung.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Lung; Neurosciences; Prevention; Tobacco; Tobacco Smoke and Health; Women's Health","SUMMARY/ABSTRACTChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 3rd leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USwith increasing prevalence in older adults. The impact of COPD on the brain is an area of expanding researchinterest. A staggering 40-60% of patients with COPD have cognitive impairments including deficits in executivefunctioning (e.g. decision making) processing speed and memory. Intact cognition is critical for independentlymanaging daily tasks (e.g. medication and money management). Since there are currently no treatments tofully reverse cognitive impairment once it is present preventing and delaying onset is essential. Given the highprevalence of COPD understanding how COPD confers an increased risk for cognitive impairment should be atop public health priority. There is an urgent need to identify potentially modifiable physiological characteristicsof individuals with early COPD-related pathophysiology who are at risk of developing brain abnormalities. Theearliest changes that occur in COPD are driven by an enhanced chronic inflammatory response that includessmall airway disease in the lung and vascular abnormalities. COPD-related lung pathophysiology can bemeasured continuously and is separable from amount of smoking. These physiological changes are oftenpresent in individuals who do not meet traditional criteria for COPD diagnosis and have not yet manifestedsignificant clinical symptoms. We propose that chronic smokers who are susceptible to COPD and showevidence of COPD-related lung pathophysiology on lung CT also experience vascular dysfunction (particularlycentral artery stiffness) that contributes to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive impairment. Theproposed project will: 1) model the effects of novel physiological mechanisms on the brain in COPD 2) focuson changes in brain structure and function early in the development of COPD by including smokers who haveevidence of early COPD-related lung pathophysiology but do not meet traditional criteria for COPD and 3)utilize advanced technology to assess the lung (lung CT) and brain (MRI). We will recruit participants withexisting lung CT from ongoing NIH projects to complete pulmonary and vascular measures cognitiveassessment and brain MRI.

Additionally 40% of subjectswith COICA who present with transient ischemic attacks and 70% of COICA who present with stroke havecognitive decline with significantly increased risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's' disease with time. Our group and others have used an alternative approach to revascularize subjects with COICAs. Thesestudies showed the feasibility and safety of using endovascular angioplasty and stenting (EAS) and/or hybrid ofboth carotid enterectomy (CEA) and EAS to restore cerebral flow to the ipsilateral hemisphere of the COICA.Furthermore our group devised a new angiographic and anatomic classification to upfront predict the successof revascularization using these techniques. This classification was tested in 2 pilot studies and the resultsshowed robust plausibility to predict upfront the percentage of success anticipated in revascularizing theselesions using these techniques. In addition 3 groups including ours showed that revascularization using thesetechniques restored cerebral blood flow to the ipsilateral hemisphere of the COICA evident of normalization ofmean transient time (MTT) on CT perfusion (CTP) and significant improvement in the cognitive function. EAS and hybrid technique restore the caliber of the cervical ICA and therefore the blood flow to allinvolved vessels with clear evidence of complete resolution of penumbra and normalization of MTT on CTP.This could provide an explanation for the marked improvement of cognitive function. Best medical management for this cohort maybe sufficient to reduce the risk of recurrent strokes and/orTIAs but not enough to improve executive and cognitive function and minimize the accelerated risk of vasculardementia and AD with time.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Nutrition; Rare Diseases","The inward depolarizing Na+ current (INa) through the cardiac Na+ channel Nav1.5 encoded bySCN5A plays a critical role in regulating the action potential of myocytes in the heart. Nav1.5 post-translational modifications (PTMs) and binding proteins can alter channel abundance and/orelectrophysiological properties. Loss of function mutations in SCN5A cause inherited arrhythmiasyndromes including Brugada syndrome (BrS) and conduction system disease by changes intranscription translation channel properties and membrane trafficking. Alterations in Nav1.5 can alsoexacerbate arrhythmias in common acquired conditions such as heart failure. NAD+ and NADH are critical regulators of myocardial bioenergetics and redox state and NAD+ is arequired substrate for sirtuins that regulate acetylation. Our laboratory reported that mutations in theNAD+/NADH dependent enzyme Gylcerol-3 Phosphate Dehydrogenase-1 Like (GPD1-L) cause BrS byaltering Nav1.5 membrane trafficking. We and others then showed that NAD+ increases INa in cell linesand cardiac myocytes at least in part through changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PKC-mediated phosphorylation in the intracellular Nav1.5 Domain III-IV linker. We have engineered Gpd1l-targeted mice that have decreased INa conduction disease arrhythmias and altered Nav1.5 PTMs. Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) a highly bioavailable NAD+ precursor increases INa in heterologousexpression systems and myocytes and shortens QRS duration in mice. The mechanism(s) by whichNAD+ supplementation alters Nav1.5 membrane trafficking and INa remains unclear. In addition howmultiple PTMs alter Nav1.5 and INa in a coordinated manner has not been studied. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cellular metabolism alters the NAD+ metabolomeregulating Nav1.5 by coordinated interactions of PTMs and binding proteins that act at the Nav1.5Domain III-IV linker. To test this hypothesis we will 1) Determine how NAD+ precursors and inhibitorsmodify the NAD+ metabolome redox state Nav1.5 PTMs INa and arrhythmias using cardiac myocytesand mouse models; 2) Determine whether NAD+ precursors act in a coordinated manner at the Nav1.5Domain III-IV linker via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation PKC-mediated phosphorylation and -actinin 2binding; and 3) Identify the Nav1.5 PTMs modulated by GPD1-L. The primary goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanisms by which NAD+ metabolism affectsNav1.5 expression and function. Ultimately we hope to determine whether increasing membraneNav1.5 with NAD+ precursors or other metabolic modulators can prevent arrhythmias in inherited Na+channel deficiency syndromes and in more common conditions such as heart failure.","Acetylation;Action Potentials;Affect;Arrhythmia;Binding;Binding Proteins;Bioavailable;Bioenergetics;Brugada syndrome;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cell Line;Cell membrane;Cells;Characteristics;DNA Damage;Data;Deacetylation;Dihydroxyacetone Phosphate;Dilated Cardiomyopathy;Disease;Dose;Electrocardiogram;Electrophysiology (science);Engineering;Enzymes;Gel;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase;Goals;Heart;Heart Atrium;Heart failure;In Vitro;Inherited;Ion Channel;Laboratories;Mediating;Membrane;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mus;Muscle Cells;Mutation;Myocardial;NADH;Neonatal;Niacinamide;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Oxidoreductase;Pharmacology;Phosphorylation;Play;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Predisposition;Property;RNA Splicing;Rattus;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reporting;Role;SIRT1 gene;Signal Transduction;Sirtuins;Sodium;Sodium Channel;Structure;Sudden Death;Sudden infant death syndrome;Supplementation;Syndrome;System;Testing;Translations;age related;alpha Actinin;alpha-glycerophosphoric acid;dietary;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;inorganic phosphate;loss of function mutation;metabolome;mouse model;nicotinamide riboside supplementation;nicotinamide-beta-riboside;novel;prevent;response;trafficking;treatment effect","Evaluating NAD Supplementation as a Novel Treatment for Arrhythmias","Abnormalities in cardiac sodium channels cause inherited arrhythmias syndromes complicated by suddendeath and are present in acquired heart conditions with sudden death such as heart failure.

There are profound disparities in ECC experiencessuch that children from minority and low-income families suffer a disproportionate share of the diseaseburden. The likelihood of parents of high-ECC risk young children seeking prevention in dental facilities is low;therefore there is a need to increase preventive dental opportunities where these children already seek healthcare services. In particular there is an urgent need to develop and evaluate ECC behavioral interventions foruse in public health settings attended by high-risk children. Many authors recommend early implementation oforal health education as one means of preventing ECC. However major issues discussed in the oral healthpromotion literature involve a lack of effectiveness among programs based on education alone as well as a lackof high quality preventive interventions using evidence-based psychological and behavioral strategies. Our research team has been the first to introduce to the ECC prevention arena the self-determinationtheory (SDT) of motivation internalization and healthy functioning proven effective in promoting positivebehavioral changes in several other fields including oral health care. We have demonstrated that SDT has greatpromise as a motivational approach by providing evidence based on results from our R21 (R21-DE016483)study of the effectiveness of SDT in changing several desirable oral health behaviors for ECC prevention.Building upon the rigor of our previous experience and formative research work in the past several years wepropose a Stage II NIH Model research project that will compare the efficacy of autonomy-supportivevideotaped oral health messages framed by SDT to more traditional neutral videotaped messages. We intent torecruit 634 pregnant mothers enrolled in Iowa Women Infants and Children (WIC) Supplemental NutritionPrograms and follow them until their future child is 36 months old. The primary outcome of interest will bechildren's caries status. Secondary outcomes will be changes in children's oral health behaviors conducive tobetter oral hygiene and dietary habits as well as lower levels of dental plaque and mutans streptococci.","Address;African American;Age;Age-Months;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Birth;Caries prevention;Child;Child Rearing;Clinic;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Clinics and Hospitals;Competence;Control Groups;Data;Dental;Dental Facilities;Dental Hygiene;Dental Offices;Dental Plaque;Dental caries;Diet Habits;Disease;Education;Effectiveness;Enrollment;Exposure to;Facebook;Failure to Thrive;Food Supplements;Funding;Future;Goals;Grant;Habits;Health Promotion;Health behavior;Health education;Healthcare;Hispanic Americans;Incidence;Infant;Infection;Institutional Review Boards;Intention;Intervention;Iowa;Knowledge;Language;Lead;Leadership;Learning;Life;Literature;Longitudinal Studies;Manuals;Medical;Methods;Minority;Minority Groups;Modeling;Monitor;Mothers;Motivation;Oral health;Outcome;Pain;Parents;Patient Self-Report;Phase;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Prevention;Preventive;Procedures;Process;Psychological Theory;Public Health;Randomized;Randomized Clinical Trials;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Risk;Rural Minority;Rural Population;Salivary;Self Determination;Series;Site;Streptococcus mutans;Structure;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Videotape;Vulnerable Populations;Woman;Work;base;behavior change;burden of illness;comparative efficacy;cost;early childhood;effectiveness evaluation;evidence base;experience;experimental group;falls;health care service;high risk;improved;instrument;interest;lower income families;minority children;nutrition;operation;prevent;preventive intervention;primary outcome;programs;psychoeducational intervention;psychologic;recruit;secondary outcome;social media;theories;tool;web site","Birth to Three  Cavity Free: Effectiveness of a Psychoeducational Intervention for ECC Prevention","PROJECT NARRATIVEUntreated cases of early childhood caries (ECC) may expose a child to pain potentially life-threating infection failure to thrive learning difficulties among several other problems.Building upon the rigor of our prior research we propose a Stage II research according to theNIH Stage Model that will compare the efficacy of videotaped autonomy-supportive oral healthmessages framed by the self-determination theory (SDT) to more traditional neutral videotapedmessages among mother-child dyads enrolled in Special Supplemental Food Program forWomen Infants and Children (WIC) programs located in a rural population with large Hispanicand African American minorities.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Opioid Misuse and Addiction; Opioids; Prescription Drug Abuse; Substance Misuse","AbstractThe US is facing a crisis of opioid overdoses and addiction. Current therapies consist largely of alternativeopioids (i.e. maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine) and do not correct neurobiological factors thatunderlie drug craving and relapse. These factors include the long-lasting changes at glutamatergic synapses inthe nucleus accumbens (NAc) which both resemble and differ from changes induced by other highly addictivedrugs such as cocaine. Our recent studies suggest these synaptic effects of opioids are opposed by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). ASICs conduct inward Na+ and Ca2+ current at post-synaptic dendritic spineswhere they are activated during synaptic transmission by protons released into the synaptic cleft fromneurotransmitter-containing vesicles. Because these protons are removed from the synaptic cleft via theactions of carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) genetically disrupting CA4 or pharmacologically inhibiting CA4 withacetazolamide (AZD) dramatically increases synaptic ASIC currents. These observations have led to ourhypothesis that AZD will reverse synaptic changes following opioid withdrawal by inhibiting CA4 andincreasing ASIC activity and thereby reduce craving and relapse. In this proposal we plan to test thishypothesis by rigorously assessing effects of opioids on synaptic physiology and behavior. Together theexperiments in this proposal will pave the way to a better understanding of the neurobiology underlying opioidaddiction and to new molecular targets for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). Knowledge gained from thesestudies could suggest new ways to treat opioid addiction through non-opioidergic mechanisms for example bymanipulating ASICs brain pH or carbonic anhydrase for which a number of inhibitors are already approvedfor human use and might be efficiently repurposed.","ASIC channel;Acetazolamide;Altitude Sickness;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Buprenorphine;Carbonic Anhydrase IV;Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors;Chronic;Clinical;Cocaine;Dendritic Spines;Dose;Drug usage;Epilepsy;Foundations;Glutamates;Goals;Human;Injections;Knowledge;Maintenance;Measures;Mediating;Methadone;Molecular;Molecular Target;Morphine;Mus;Nature;Neurobiology;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Nucleus Accumbens;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physiology;Pilot Projects;Play;Protons;Relapse;Role;Self Administration;Signal Pathway;Synapses;Synaptic Cleft;Synaptic Transmission;Testing;Vesicle;Withdrawal;addiction;carbonate dehydratase;conditioned place preference;craving;drug craving;drug of abuse;drug relapse;drug seeking behavior;drug withdrawal;experimental study;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;non-opioid analgesic;novel;opioid abuse;opioid epidemic;opioid mortality;opioid overdose;opioid use disorder;opioid withdrawal;prevent","Novel mechanisms for correcting opioid-induced synaptic abnormalities","NarrativeThe US is facing a crisis of opioid overdoses and addiction.

"Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY: Most small molecule drugs elicit their effects by modulating protein function despite thefact that only a small portion of the genome is translated (~1-2%). Further only ~15% of the human proteome isconsidered to be druggable severely limiting therapeutic pipelines. The scientific challenge is to developgeneralizable methods to drug the other ~85% of coding genes. The purpose of this proposal is to advance aradically new paradigm to expand the druggability of the (protein coding) genome by targeting disease-causinggenes at the level of their RNA. To do so we will computationally and biochemically determine RNA secondarystructures in the transcriptome with a focus on disease associated genes to aid in the design of drug-like smallmolecules to treat diseases at the RNA level. This innovative approach for targeting the transcriptome couldmassively expand our ability to treat a wide array of diseases spanning from genetic disorders to cancer andpathogenic infections and expanding the repertoire of drug action. The proposed studies synergize the expertise of two laboratories. Dr. Walter Moss Lab (sponsor) hasdeveloped and implemented robust approaches to precisely define conserved and functional RNA structuresthroughout the human genome. Dr. Matthew Disneys lab (co-sponsor) has established a comprehensiveprogram for the design of small molecules that selectively target RNA and modulate disease biology includingthose that selectively recruit endogenous nucleases to a desired transcript. Collectively our synergistic areas ofexpertise will allow us to define the druggable human genome drug undruggable protein targets at the level oftheir mRNAs and push forward a bench-to-bedside precision medicine paradigm. In Aim 1 we will define conserved RNA structures throughout the genome with a focus on validating andtargeting conserved structures in mRNAs that encode proteins that are considered undruggable. These studieswill define evolutionary conservation across vertebrate genomes to provide key insights into both biology anddruggability. We will evaluate and improve model structures using in cellulis RNA structure probing to testpredictions and where needed provide constraints that can be used to create experimentally informed revisedmodels. In Aim 2 we will generate a list of high value motifs with the highest probability of being druggableperform functional analyses to determine their effects on gene expression and deduce interactions.","2019-nCoV;Algorithms;Archives;Area;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biology;Bypass;Cell Line;Chemicals;Code;Collection;Computer software;Conflict (Psychology);Data;Databases;Disease;Disease model;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;Elements;Engineering;Ensure;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Diseases;Genome;Health;Human;Human Genome;Infection;KRAS2 gene;Knowledge;Laboratories;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Messenger RNA;Methods;Modeling;Mosses;Oncogenes;Outcome;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Probability;Proteins;Proteome;RNA;RNA Binding;RNA Probes;RNA Viruses;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Specificity;Stress;Structural Models;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Transcript;Translating;Untranslated RNA;Validation;Weight;alpha synuclein;bench to bedside;cheminformatics;comparative;design;drug action;drug candidate;drug discovery;human pathogen;improved;innovation;insight;interest;intermolecular interaction;novel;novel therapeutics;nuclease;precision medicine;predictive modeling;programs;protein function;recruit;small molecule;targeted treatment;tau Proteins;therapeutic lead compound;tool;transcriptome;vertebrate genome","Expanding the Druggable Human Genome","PROJECT NARRATIVEWe will generate a human RNA structure-omics signature using bioinformatics and cheminformatics tools todetermine and validate RNA targets for small molecule drug design.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Chronic Pain; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Physical Activity; Prevention","Project Summary/ AbstractRegular physical activity is associated with reduced incidence of chronic pain in epidemiological studies; yetan acute bout of exercise can exacerbate pain in those with chronic pain. Analogously in animal models weshow a single bout of exercise enhances the nociceptive response to muscle insult in physically inactive miceand that regular physical activity prevents the development of chronic muscle hyperalgesia. The mechanismsdriving this apparent dichotomy in pain response to physical activity are poorly understood. We propose thisdichotomy may in large part be explained by the plasticity of local muscle macrophages. Macrophages releaseinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines depending on two relevant phenotypes: classically-activated (M1)macrophages release inflammatory cytokines and regulatory (M2) macrophages release anti-inflammatorycytokines. The relative proportion of macrophage phenotype dictates the immune response and we proposethat regular physical activity shifts the balance between M1 and M2 macrophages to result in greater release ofanti-inflammatory cytokines. Fatigue metabolites adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and protons produce pain inhumans and hyperalgesia in inactive animals and activate surface receptors P2X7 and ASIC3 onmacrophages. Our preliminary data support a role for macrophages in both activity-induced pain and activity-induced analgesia and show a greater proportion of M2s after regular exercise. Specific Aim 1 will investigatethe role of macrophages in activity-induced hyperalgesia in physically inactive mice. We hypothesize thatactivation of P2X7 or ASIC3 on muscle macrophages releases IL-1 in physically inactive animals to producehyperalgesia. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the role of macrophages in prevention of chronic muscle pain byregular physical activity. We hypothesize that activation of P2X7 or ASCI3 on muscle macrophages releasesIL-10 in physically active animals to produce analgesia. Specific Aim 3 will investigate if ATP protons or theircombination produces a phenotypic switch in cultured macrophages from M1 to M2. We hypothesize that thecombination of ATP and protons is necessary to induce the phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 macrophages.These studies will examine the interactions between muscle macrophages and nociceptors and thus will bethe first to determine the role of the innate immune system in activity-induced hyperalgesia and analgesia.Understanding these mechanisms is critically important to understanding the development and prevention ofchronic pain and the consequences of physical activity in individuals with pain. Treatments aimed at reducingpain during an initial exercise program could lead to better adherence in maintaining regular physical activityfor people with chronic pain. Further determining factors activated by regular physical activity which activatesendogenous resolution mechanisms is a critical component to preventing the transition from acute to chronicpain.","ASIC channel;Absence of pain sensation;Acute;Address;Adenosine Triphosphate;Adherence;Analgesics;Animal Model;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Automobile Driving;Biology;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Data;Development;Down-Regulation;Equilibrium;Exercise;Fatigue;Human;Hyperalgesia;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Incidence;Individual;Inflammatory;Innate Immune System;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 Receptors;Interleukin-10;Lead;MicroRNAs;Mus;Muscle;Myalgia;Nociceptors;Pain;Pain management;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Physical activity;Prevention;Protons;Publishing;Purinoceptor;Receptor Activation;Resolution;Role;Surface;Testing;Viral;chronic musculoskeletal pain;chronic pain;cytokine;epidemiology study;exercise program;improved;macrophage;nociceptive response;pain model;pain reduction;physical inactivity;prevent;receptor;response","Role of macrophages in activity-induced pain and analgesia","Project NarrativeRegular physical activity can prevent development of chronic musculoskeletal pain; whereas unaccustomedexercise can exacerbate pain in those with chronic pain.

Early recognition and resuscitation of pediatric sepsis canreduce mortality and improve outcomes. However current adherence to early resuscitation guidelines remainslow among pediatric sepsis and septic shock patients. Adherence to pediatric sepsis care guidelines is worsethan in the adult sepsis population especially in low-volume facilities. Compared to adults pediatric sepsispatients may be at higher risk of disparate incidence and outcomes given sparser access to definitive pediatrichospital care. The central hypothesis of this study is that increased pediatric sepsis mortality can be partiallyattributed to geographic access and facility-level characteristics among patients with similar severities ofillness. This study will use multi-state all-payer administrative claims data and a national readiness survey ofemergency departments (EDs) to test the central hypothesis with the following aims: (1) identify facility-levelcharacteristics associated with effective pediatric sepsis care and (2) determine the role of access to care inpediatric sepsis outcomes.

"Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTDyslipidemia and insulin resistance predispose individuals to development of diabetes cancer myocardialinfarction and stroke. A large body of evidence suggests that a class of toxic lipids termed ceramidescontribute to these metabolic impairments and the ensuing development of these metabolic disorders.Understanding the role of these lipids in the events that drive metabolic diseases holds great promise fordeveloping new therapies to treat these debilitating conditions. We conducted a series of studies ablating theenzymes required for their production in different body locales to discern which tissues were most sensitive toceramides. These studies revealed that the lipid has strong and unanticipated effects in adipose tissue. Inparticular whole-body adipose and brown adipose tissue-specific inhibition/deletion of serinepalmitoyltransferase (Sptlc) the first enzyme in the enzymatic cascade that drives sphingolipid biosynthesis inmice markedly altered adipose morphology and metabolism particularly in subcutaneous and brown adiposetissue. We subsequently excised another gene in the pathway (i.d. dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (Degs1)) fromadipose tissue determining that it elicited a similar spectrum of metabolic improvements. These data indicatethat ceramides serve as signals of nutrient excess that alter the metabolic activity of mature adipocytes andsubsequently the entire organism. Using microarray screens we sought to identify ceramide-regulated genes inadipose tissue. The candidate obesity gene Fgf13 was one of the only two transcripts that met the followingcriteria: (a) increased in mouse subcutaneous white adipose (sWAT) and epididymal white adipose (eWAT) afterhigh fat feeding (HFD); (b) decreased in these depots when the mice were treated with the SPT inhibitor myriocin;(c) decreased in these depots following WAT-specific Sptlc2 depletion; and (d) decreased in primary adipocytesfollowing myriocin treatment in vitro. We then investigated the function of this protein in vitro and in vivo.Preliminary data using knockdown or knockout approaches suggested that Fgf13 had cell-autonomousadipocyte-specific diet-regulated effects on mitochondrial function and thermogenesis. Moreover mice lackingFgf13 in adipocytes were resistant to obesity. These data support our hypothesis that FGF13 is a ceramideeffector that controls the metabolic activity of mature adipocytes. We will test this idea with the following SpecificAims: 1] to determine the role of FGF13 as a modulator of adipose tissue metabolism and thermogenesis invivo; 2] to determine the molecular mechanisms linking FGF13 to adipocyte metabolism; and 3] to determinethe molecular mechanisms by which b-adrenergic agonists regulate ceramide production and FGF13 expressionin primary adipocytes.

"Mental Health; Neurosciences","Abstract Timing or decisions based on temporal information on the scale of seconds is critical for survival.Capturing prey foraging and evading predators require choices to initiate and suppress movements preciselyin time. Similarly daily human activities like communication cooking walking and crossing the street requireprecise timing. Failures in timing can have disastrous consequences. Despite its importance the neural basisof timing is unknown in part because timing is understudied. Because timing is vital to higher-order executivefunctions such as inhibitory control reasoning and planning there is a critical need to better understand itsneural basis. We study this problem using interval timing which requires subjects to make a motor responseafter an interval of several seconds. Interval timing requires cognitive functions such as working memory for temporal rules and attention tothe passage of time. Therefore during interval timing subjects must cognitively control their responses basedon their estimation of elapsed time. Our objective in this basic-science proposal is to study how dopamine-receptor-expressing neurons in frontostriatal circuits control interval timing. Our recent work demonstrates thatinterval timing requires neurons in the dorsal prelimbic region of medial frontal cortex (MFC) that express D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs; also called MFC D1 neurons). MFC neurons project to medium spinyneurons (MSNs) in the dorsomedial striatum. These MSNs also express dopamine receptors and ourpreliminary data suggests that striatal D1 and D2 MSNs play distinct roles during timing tasks. Our hypothesisis that MFC D1 neurons dynamically regulate the activity of D1 and D2 MSNs to control interval timing. In Aim1 we will determine whether MFC D1 neurons control timing-dependent activity in MSNs. In Aim 2 we willdetermine whether D1 and D2 MSNs control interval-timing behavior. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine iffrontostriatal stimulation can compensate for MFC inactivation. Findings from our work will be significant in providing fundamental mechanistic insight into howdopamine-receptor-expressing frontostriatal neurons are involved in cognitive control. Our approach isinnovative in studying corticostriatal circuits in a cognitive task rather than in movement or motivation. We willalso combine neuronal ensemble recording with optogenetics which facilitates adaptive brain stimulationguided online by brain activity in Aim 3. This approach has the potential to identify and rectify dysfunctionalneuronal activity patterns in real time. Because timing involves highly conserved MFC circuits in mice andhumansand is impaired in diseases such as schizophrenia ADHD OCD and bipolar disorderinsights fromthis basic science proposal are likely to have relevance for humans.","Affect;Anterior;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Automobile Driving;Axon;Basal Ganglia;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavioral;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Communication;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Decision Making;Dimensions;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;Dorsal;Drug Targeting;Exhibits;Failure;Functional disorder;Goals;Human;Human Activities;Ice;Impairment;Maps;Measures;Medial;Mental disorders;Motivation;Motor;Movement;Mus;Muscimol;Neurons;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Performance;Pharmacology;Play;Process;Publishing;Ramp;Resolution;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Source;Specificity;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;Time;Walking;Work;base;cell type;cognitive control;cognitive function;cognitive task;cooking;executive function;frontal lobe;human disease;innovation;insight;millimeter;millisecond;neuronal circuitry;optogenetics;receptor;relating to nervous system;response;temporal measurement;therapeutic target","Timing and dopamine in frontostriatal circuits","Project NarrativeTime is a fundamental dimension of mammalian behavior.

"Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Endocrine Disruptors","SUMMARY: Project 5  Remediation in SedimentsPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are commonly encountered organic chemical pollutants of concern atSuperfund sites which are often found in river and lake sediments near areas of industrial and commercialactivity. The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) has shown that airborne PCB emissions from openwater associated with contaminated sediment sources could pose significant inhalation risk to nearbypopulations. Project 5 research is based on the critical need to develop evaluate and demonstrate innovativeapproaches to disrupt the flux of PCBs from sediments to the atmosphere at Superfund sites. Project 5scentral hypothesis is that black carbon materials containing PCB-degrading biofilms will enhance aerobicbiodegradation of LC-PCBs in contaminated sediments thereby decreasing their emission into theatmosphere. Our hypothesis is based on preliminary studies showing that bioaugmentation of aerobic PCB-degrading bacteria into soils catalyzes improved biodegradation of certain LC-PCB congeners. We also showthat aerobic PCB-degrading bacteria form biofilms on black carbon materials indicating their potential asdelivery vehicles for introducing PCB-degrading bacteria into sediments. Guided by these preliminary data wewill test our central hypothesis by: 1) optimizing tailored black carbon materials with sorptive and reactiveproperties toward LC-PCBs and the ability to host aerobic PCB-degrading biofilms; 2) evaluating theperformance of black carbon materials containing aerobic PCB-degrading biofilms to lower LC-PCBconcentrations in water and air under relevant environmental conditions; and 3) scaling up production ofbiofilm-coated black carbon materials to demonstrate the feasibility of decreasing airborne PCB flux fromcontaminated sediments at the mesocosm-scale. Our work will rely on the support of ISRP cores for synthesisand analytical assessment of PCBs in study samples. The proposed research is innovative because therelationship between the removal of LC-PCB congeners from sediments and PCB emissions has not beenstudied. There are currently no developed or tested biotechnologies to decrease or prevent airborne PCBemissions from sediments. Our project is relevant to the SRP mandates because we will develop advancedmethods to decrease the amount and toxicity of PCBs in the environment. Outcomes of this project will benefithuman health by reducing human exposure to airborne PCBs and realize economic benefits by demonstratingbreakthrough alternative PCB remediation approaches that minimize expensive and disruptive measures suchas dredging.","Address;Aerobic;Air;Area;Atmosphere;Bacteria;Biodegradation;Biological Process;Biotechnology;Carbon Black;Chemicals;Chlorine;Communities;Coupled;Data;Development;Ecology;Economics;Environment;Environmental Engineering technology;Excision;Exposure to;Goals;Health;Human;Individual;Industrialization;Inhalation;Iowa;Laboratories;Materials Testing;Measures;Methods;Microbe;Microbial Biofilms;Molecular;Organic Chemicals;Outcome;Oxygen;Performance;Poison;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Process;Production;Program Research Project Grants;Property;Research;Resources;Risk;Rivers;Saline;Sampling;Sampling Studies;Soil;Source;Superfund;Technology Transfer;Temperature;Testing;Toxic effect;Universities;Volatilization;Water;Work;base;contaminated sediment;data management;disease registry;efficacy evaluation;experience;exposed human population;fungus;improved;innovation;microbial;microorganism;novel;pollutant;prevent;programs;remediation;scale up;superfund site;tool","Mitigating Airborne PCB Emissions from Sediments with Black Carbon Materials and PCB-Degrading Biofilms","NARRATIVE: Project 5  Remediation in SedimentsProject 5 of the Iowa Superfund Research Program will develop and optimize novel sorptive and reactive blackcarbon materials and test them as delivery vehicles for aerobic PCB-degrading microorganisms underenvironmentally relevant conditions (e.g. low and variable dissolved oxygen concentrations and variable salinityand temperature).

"Endocrine Disruptors; Health Disparities","SUMMARY: Project 4  Sources of Airborne PCBsProject 4 addresses SRP mandates for improved methods for detecting and assessing the hazards ofSuperfund chemicals. We will identify and characterize sources of airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)within schools and homes and near superfund sites with PCB-contaminated sediments. Sources of airbornePCBs may include building materials contaminated with legacy Aroclor PCBs as well as consumer productsthat are inadvertently contaminated with PCBs through the manufacturing process. Our central hypothesis isthat emissions of airborne PCBs are a function of the properties of the PCB congeners environmentalvariables and exposed surfaces in which the PCBs reside. We will examine all PCB congeners and bothAroclor and non-Aroclor sources of airborne PCBs. We will evaluate emissions from materials and productsfound in schools and neighborhoods in our partner communities using methods that are accurate precise andreproducible. Data produced by Project 4 will enable cost-effective decisions for their removal.We will address Project 4s central hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: We will developnovel passive sampling materials. We will design and manufacture tailored electrospun nanofiber mat (ENM)as an efficient and adaptable material for passive air sampling. We will design calibrate and deploy samplersequipped with this novel material to detect and measure PCB congeners in the environment. Aim 2: We willidentify specific sources of airborne PCBs in schools and homes. ISRP research has already shown thatbuilding materials contaminated with Aroclors and consumer products contaminated with non-Aroclorcongeners can contribute to high levels of PCBs in indoor air. We will measure airborne PCBs in schools andhomes of Columbus Junction and West Liberty Iowa; generate an inventory of potential sources in the schoolrooms; and measure emissions from those materials. We will also develop new laboratory methods to measureemissions and will apply computational fluid dynamics modeling of school rooms to determine the role of eachmaterial or consumer product as a source of airborne PCBs. Aim 3: We will characterize emissions fromcontaminated waters nation-wide. We hypothesize that contaminated waters are a major outdoor source ofairborne PCB exposure nation-wide. We will use existing public data to predict emissions dispersion andannual median air concentrations in communities surrounding these waters. We will test our prediction throughlocal measurements of airborne PCBs and communicate our findings to local communities and environmentalprotection officials including the EPA. Our studies require close collaboration with the ISRP Analytical CoreCommunity Engagement Core and Data Management and Analysis Core. Through these collaborationsProject 4 will provide strategies to prioritize technically and economically practical remediation options thatfocus on reduction of exposure to PCBs.","Address;Adult;Air;Categories;Child;Collaborations;Color;Communities;Data;Data Analyses;Diet;Environment;Environmental Protection;Equipment and supply inventories;Event;Excision;Exhibits;Exposure to;Fishes;Freedom;Gases;Goals;Home;Inhalation;Inhalation Exposure;Iowa;Laboratories;Light;Liquid substance;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Neighborhoods;Outcome;Phase;Physical Function;Pigments;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Polymers;Population;Program Research Project Grants;Property;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Sampling;Schools;Signal Recognition Particle;Site;Source;Superfund;Surface;Techniques;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Uncertainty;Vulnerable Populations;Water;air sampling;building materials;chemical function;community engagement;consumer product;contaminated sediment;contaminated water;cost effective;data management;design;exposed human population;hazard;improved;laboratory experiment;manufacturing process;nanofiber;novel;novel strategies;remediation;superfund chemical;superfund site;teacher;uptake;urban area","Sources of Airborne PCB Congeners","NARRATIVE: Project 4  Sources of Airborne PCBsThe Iowa Superfund Research Programs Project 4 addresses the problem of airborne PCBs in schools inhomes and in communities near PCB-contaminated water.

"Clinical Research; Endocrine Disruptors; Nutrition; Pediatric; Prevention","SUMMARY: Project 3  The AESOP StudyThe Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) AESOP Study (Airborne Exposures to Semi-volatile OrganicPollutants) is a community-based participatory research study that assesses inhalation and dietary exposuresto PCBs PCB metabolites and potential biomarkers among cohorts of adolescent children and their mothersin three Midwest U.S. communities. We previously reported that although intentional production of PCBs aslegacy Superfund chemicals ended in the 1970s production continues as building material byproducts. TheAESOP Study identifies the determinants of PCB exposures including dietary intake and airborne exposurelevels indoors and outdoors. In the proposed new funding cycle the AESOP Study will have an unparalleledopportunity to characterize the role of personal inhalation exposures to PCBs at home and in schools for theircontribution to the exposure burden that could result in elevated risks for hormone disruption metabolicsyndrome and neurobehavioral outcomes. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Collect and analyze demographicresidential occupational activity dietary and health data from AESOP Study participants. Aim 2: Characterizepersonal exposures to PCB congeners among children and their mothers and apportion exposures toinhalation and diet at the congener level. The study will analyze blood and urine for 209 PCBs and 74metabolites as well as for biomarkers of thyroid hormone dysfunction inflammation and metabolic syndrome.Aim 3: Assess adolescent childrens time-integrated personal exposure to airborne PCBs. Aim 4: Model PCBcongener exposures and body burdens; compare modeled and measured data. The study enjoys strongcommunity support garnered through our Community Advisory Boards working with AESOP Study staff andthe ISRP Community Engagement Core; this support will help facilitate these aims. The AESOP Studyemploys bilingual community-based field staff and has enrolled and followed 381 subjects in racially andethnically diverse communities providing new insights into airborne exposures and resulting body burdens.The AESOP Study provides human samples and data to other projects within the ISRP providing enhancedrelevance for those projects. De-identified data are widely shared with study participants the scientificcommunity and stakeholders at EPA and ATSDR. The AESOP Study has already changed the prevailingviews on how most Americans are exposed to PCBs. We have demonstrated that children have substantialexposure to PCB congeners from inhalation at school; their blood shows enrichment with inhaled lower-chlorinated congeners. This has important implications for childrens environmental health that the AESOPStudy will further elucidate during the next five years.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Air;American;Area;Back;Behavioral;Biological Markers;Biological Monitoring;Blood;Body Burden;Breast Feeding;Chicago;Child;Chronic;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Communities;Coupled;DNA;Data;Data Aggregation;Demographic Accounting;Demographic Survey;Diet;Dietary intake;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Eating;Enrollment;Environment;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollution;Excretory function;Exposure to;Family Study;Food;Freedom;Functional disorder;Funding;Health;Health Status;Home;Hormones;Human;Indiana;Individual;Indoor Air Pollution;Inflammation;Inhalation;Inhalation Exposure;Inhalation Toxicology;Iowa;Life Cycle Stages;Link;Location;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Midwestern United States;Modeling;Mothers;National Health Interview Survey;Occupational;Oral;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Participant;Perinatal Exposure;Physiological;Policies;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Production;Questionnaires;Reporting;Research;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Risk Estimate;Risk Factors;Role;Route;Rural;Sampling;Schools;Serum;Source;Study Subject;Superfund;Surveys;Testing;Thyroid Hormones;Time;Toxic effect;Uncertainty;Urine;absorption;base;bilingualism;biobank;building materials;cohort;community based participatory research;community based research;community engagement;computerized tools;data de-identification;design;dietary;early detection biomarkers;ethnic diversity;experience;exposure route;food consumption;health data;innovation;insight;models and simulation;nanofiber;neurobehavioral;novel;pharmacokinetic model;physiologically based pharmacokinetics;placental transfer;pollutant;potential biomarker;predictive modeling;programs;racial diversity;recruit;remediation;research study;superfund chemical;uptake","The AESOP Study: Airborne Exposures to Semi-volatile Organic Pollutants","PROJECT NARRATIVE: Project 3  The AESOP StudyThe Iowa Superfund Research Programs AESOP Study (Project 3) is a community-based research study toassess personal inhalation and dietary exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) arising from legacy andnon-legacy environmental pollution and indoor air contamination among adolescent children and their mothersin one urban and two rural diverse communities.

"Childhood Obesity; Diabetes; Endocrine Disruptors; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric","SUMMARY: Project 2  Metabolic SyndromePCBs accumulate in fat and are associated with the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) yet thespecific role of PCB-induced disruption of adipose endocrine signaling in the development of MetS is unknown.Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between exposure to PCBs and MetS a cluster ofconditions including obesity hypertension dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia which increase the risk of heartdisease stroke and type II diabetes. The Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) has shown children areexposed to high levels of airborne PCBs in schools putting them at potential risk for the development of MetS.In addition the ISRP demonstrated that airborne PCB exposure results in the accumulation of PCBs in adiposetissue. We have shown that dioxin-like PCBs can disrupt adipogenesis leading to aberrant adipocyte function.How volatile PCBs affect adipose tissue to contribute to the development of MetS is unknown. We hypothesizethat airborne PCBs and their metabolites contribute to the development of MetS via a mechanism that involvesdisruption of adipogenesis and adipocyte endocrine function. We have developed unique tools includingmultiple unique immortal human preadipocyte cell lines and a 3D organoid model system that enable the studyof PCB-induced alterations in the maturation and function of human adipose tissue in culture. Humanpreadipocytes cultured in the 3D organoid model system can mature store lipids and secrete adipokines moreefficiently than those in 2D cultures. This system challenges the status quo of 2D culture with a culture modelthat is more relevant to human exposure. In Aim 1 we will utilize the 3D system to elucidate the functionalconsequences of exposure to PCBs (individual congeners and relevant mixtures) on adipogenesis andadipocyte function. In Aim 2 we will develop a human adipose-liver biomimetic on-chip that allows for human-liver specific metabolism of PCBs for facile testing of the effects of PCB and PCB-metabolites on adiposefunction. In Aim 3 we will assess how PCB11 and PCB52 two PCBs commonly found in air affect adiposefunction adiposity and metabolism in vivo using a rat model comparing our results to those found with our 3Dsystem. The studies will be guided by other ISRP projects to determine which PCBs are most prevalent in airand which PCBs and PCB-metabolites are present in adipose tissue. Further our work will rely on ISRP coresfor synthesis and analytical assessment of PCBs in study samples. Our project is relevant to the SRPmandates because it will result in the development of an innovative technology to assess how PCBs act asendocrine disruptors through their effects on adipose tissue which in turn will be important for assessment ofexposure risk to the development of MetS.

"Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 1  NeurotoxicityStudies by the Iowa Superfund Research Program demonstrate that inhalation of indoor air especially in U.S.schools contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) represents a current public health concern for U.S.adolescents. Although the adolescent brain is vulnerable to the toxicity of PCBs and their metabolites informationregarding the neurotoxicity of human metabolites of airborne PCBswhich differ significantly from those formed inrodentsis currently not available. There is therefore a critical need to: 1) establish mechanisms by whichhuman metabolites of PCBs affect neurochemistry (i.e. toxic neurotransmitter metabolites) and subsequentbehavioral outcomes; and 2) determine how metabolism of airborne PCBs and their metabolites in the brainrepresents a key event in PCB-mediated neurotoxicity in adolescents exposed to PCBs. The objective of thisproject is to inform future risk assessment by defining the link between neurotoxic PCB metabolites present inthe brain and neurotoxic outcomes following exposure during adolescence. Our central hypothesis is that inaddition to the parent airborne PCBs metabolites formed in humans are present in the brain and serve as riskfactors for altered neurodevelopment during adolescence. We propose that PCBs and especially theirmetabolites adversely affect neurotransmitter homeostasis. This hypothesis is based on preliminary studiesshowing that metabolites of airborne PCBs: a) are present in the rodent brain; b) cause oxidative stress in vitroand in vivo; c) alter neurotransmitter homeostasis in dopaminergic neurons in culture producing ROS and toxiccatecholaldehydes; and d) undergo further metabolism to potentially toxic metabolites in the brain. Guided bythese preliminary data the novel hypothesis will be tested by 1) identifying cellular sites and targets of airbornePCB metabolites vs. parent compounds responsible for neurotoxicity in vitro; 2) characterizing the region-specific biotransformation of PCBs and PCB metabolites with in vitro models and in the adolescent rat brain invivo; and 3) determining the effects of human metabolites of airborne PCBs on biochemical markers of PCBneurotoxicity and behavioral outcomes in rats exposed throughout adolescence in vivo. The proposed researchis innovative because it determines how the disruption of dopamine balance by PCB metabolites disturbsdopamine levels and/or produces toxic dopamine metabolites detrimental to the brain in adolescence a periodof vulnerability; and studies localized metabolism in the brain thus challenging the scientific paradigm thatPCBs are either resistant to metabolism or metabolized only in the liver. Outcomes of the proposed studies willelucidate the contributions of airborne PCBs and their metabolites to and their mechanisms of action inneurotoxic responses.

"No NIH Category available","SUMMARY: Synthesis CoreThe Superfund Research Program at The University of Iowa (ISRP) supports investigations of theconsequences of sources and exposures to all airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) an important classof Superfund chemicals. ISRP biomedical and environmental research projects require a variety of studycompounds ranging from technical and synthetic PCB mixtures to pure PCB congeners and their metabolitesfor studies of the volatilization transport exposure toxicity and remediation of these PCB congeners. A majorobstacle for these studies is the large number of 209 PCB congeners plus the large number of 837 possiblemono-hydroxylated (OH-PCBs) sulfated (PCB sulfates) glucuronidated (PCB glucuronides) and other PCBmetabolites. Many of these PCB derivatives are not available from commercial sources or have never beensynthesized before. Obtaining PCB mixtures or individual PCB congeners from commercial sources can alsobe expensive especially if large quantities are needed for animal studies. Moreover information about theirsynthesis is typically not available from commercial sources. To facilitate the innovative studies proposed byindividual ISRP research projects there is a critical need to make sufficient quantities of PCBs and theirmetabolites available for studies investigating the volatilization transport exposure toxicity and remediation ofPCBs. To address this critical need the major objective of the Synthesis Core is to provide a large variety ofwell-authenticated and highly-pure PCB derivatives in a timely and cost-efficient manner to ISRP and as timeand resources allow other researchers. To attain this objective the Synthesis Core will synthesize andmaintain a broad range of PCB derivatives and employ rigorous guidelines for the authentication of these keychemicals. At the same time the Synthesis Core will continue to develop novel synthetic strategies for thesynthesis of PCB congeners and PCB metabolites as needed by ISRP researchers. The Specific Aims of theISRP Synthesis Core are to: 1) maintain and prepare PCB mixtures and pure PCB congeners; 2) preparehydroxylated PCB derivatives; 3) synthesize PCB sulfate metabolites; and 4) prepare miscellaneouscompounds such as: PCB hydroquinones PCB catechols PCB quinones and PCB glutathione and N-acetylcysteine conjugates. The timely availability of PCB mixtures individual OH-PCBs PCB sulfates andother PCB metabolites will greatly enhance and if the respective PCB metabolites are unavailable fromcommercial sources enable the innovative studies proposed by ISRP Research Projects. Moreover the use ofwell-authenticated test compounds across several ISRP research projects will greatly enhance the rigor andreproducibility of ISRP research.","Acetylcysteine;Address;Animals;Catechols;Chemicals;Diazomethane;Exposure to;Funding;Glucuronides;Glutathione;Goals;Guidelines;Hand;Hydroquinones;In Vitro;Individual;Investigation;Iowa;Laboratory Study;Mammals;Plants;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Positioning Attribute;Preparation;Program Research Project Grants;Quinones;Reagent;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resources;Series;Source;Sulfate;Superfund;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;Universities;Volatilization;cost efficient;experience;exposed human population;in vivo;innovation;novel;programs;remediation;repository;superfund chemical","Research Support Core: Synthesis Core","NARRATIVE: Synthesis CoreThe Synthesis Core of the Superfund Research Program at The University of Iowa (ISRP) supportsinvestigations of the consequences of sources and exposures to all airborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)an important class of Superfund chemicals by providing PCB mixture individual PCB congeners and PCBmetabolites to ISRP researchers for laboratory studies and as analytical standards.

"Endocrine Disruptors; Prevention; Social Determinants of Health","PROJECT SUMMARY: Research Experience and Training Coordination CoreThe 20th century brought the chemical revolution and the steady increase of large-scale production ofchemicals. Only later did the problem of environmental persistence of some of these new and useful chemicalsbecome evident and only recently did we discover the magnitude of the negative health effects caused bythese pollutants including brain diseases and metabolic syndrome cancer fertility problems reduced immunesystem function and even hearing loss and autism. Moreover these pollutants may volatilize and contaminateindoor and outdoor air. Environmental health and engineering professionals must now deal with these legacycontaminants in multiple dimensions to protect humans and the environment and to prevent futurecontamination. As a consequence the traditional training approach designed to produce specialized experts inindividual narrow disciplines is clearly inappropriate to prepare trainees for leadership roles in environmentalhealth and technology. Instead future scientists and engineers need thorough training in their specific fieldssupported by basic knowledge of diverse areas (socioeconomics policy engineering and science) along withcommunication and collaboration skills to work with specialists in other disciplines and with varied stakeholdersand affected communities. To properly prepare students and post-docs the Iowa Superfund ResearchProgram (ISRP) Research Experience and Training Coordination Core (RETCC) will: 1) identify promoteevaluate and track interdisciplinary training approaches; 2) coordinate training in ISRP methods andapplications; 3) develop opportunities for trainee participation in the ISRP Community Engagement Core and inresearch translation activities; 4) interact with the ISRP Data Management and Analysis Core to providetraining in data management analysis and data sharing; and 5) offer opportunities for professional careerdevelopment. In the last funding circle (April 2015November 2018) 48 graduate students and postdocs (24ongoing) obtained such training. To build on this success we are creating and coordinating a unique set ofcourses seminars workshops community outreach and research translation experiences so all ISRPtrainees can gain insights into health effects risk detection and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) the needs of stakeholders and affected communities and how to build a successful career. ISRPresearchers make this possible through established successful supportive collaborations with colleaguesrepresenting diverse areas such as toxicology occupational and environmental health medicinalpharmacology environmental and medical engineering and urban and regional planning along withextraordinary support from the University of Iowa Graduate College. The RETCCs unique resources willensure its future success of preparing a new generation of scientists and engineers to solve the environmentalpollution challenges of the 21st century.","Affect;Air;Area;Biometry;Brain Diseases;Catalogs;Chemicals;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Community Outreach;Complex;Data;Data Analyses;Detection;Development Plans;Dimensions;Discipline;Educational workshop;Engineering;Ensure;Environment;Environmental Engineering technology;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollution;Equipment;Ethics;Exposure to;Faculty;Fertility;Funding;Future;Generations;Goals;Hazard Identification;Health;Health Technology;Human;Individual;Iowa;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leadership;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Mentors;Metabolic syndrome;Methods;Microbiology;Modeling;Occupational Health;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Policies;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Postdoctoral Fellow;Prevention;Program Research Project Grants;Research;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;Research Project Summaries;Research Technics;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Role;Science;Scientist;Source;Specialist;Students;Superfund;Techniques;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Training;Training Programs;Translational Research;Universities;Vocational Guidance;Work;autism spectrum disorder;career;career development;college;community engagement;data management;data sharing;design;experience;graduate student;hazard;hearing impairment;immune system function;insight;interdisciplinary approach;laboratory curriculum;large scale production;meetings;multidisciplinary;pollutant;posters;prevent;programs;remediation;skills;socioeconomics;student participation;success;tool;urban planning","Research Experience & Training Coordination Core","n/a","NIEHS","10135990","1/28/2021","RFA-ES-18-002","5P42ES013661-16","5","P42","ES","013661","16","","","5/12/2006"," ","ZES1-JAB-D","5426","1875222","LUDEWIG, GABRIELE ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2021","1/31/2022"," "," ","Research Centers","2021"," ","68439"," ","43173","25266"," "," ",
"Clinical Research; Pediatric; Prevention","SUMMARY: Community Engagement Core The Community Engagement Core (CEC) facilitates bidirectional interactions between community stakeholders and the ISRP researchers who study polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a class of Superfund chemicals. These bidirectional interactions are critical to ISRPs long-term goal of improving the health and well-being of populations by preventing or limiting exposure to PCBs through scientifically-informed interventions. ISRP studies demonstrate that inhalation of indoor air especially in schools in the United States contaminated with airborne PCBs represents a significant and current public health concern for school-aged children. The CEC is an important integrating core for the ISRP because it develops partnerships with communities impacted by PCBs serves as a source of information and educational resources for these communities and acts as a liaison between partner communities and researchers. The CEC is fully integrated with ISRP research projects and other cores and has existing or developing relationships with the partner communities. Columbus Junction Iowa and East Chicago Ind. have been active participants in the ISRP AESOP (Project 3) prospective human cohort study since 2006 during which time the CEC has facilitated a variety of school- and community-based engagements. West Liberty Iowa is proposed as a new AESOP cohort community and will also be the location of several proposed Project 4 activities focused on source characterization and remediation of airborne PCBs in schools and homes (these activities are ongoing in Columbus Junction and East Chicago). More than 100000 people live within 5 km of the New Bedford Harbor Superfund site where the current ISRP Project 4 found large emissions of gas-phase PCBs. Building on this important discovery Project 5 will research how to reduce PCB emissions from New Bedford Harbor and the CEC will facilitate bidirectional interactions focused on report-back engagements designed to harvest community input and share relevant ISRP research findings. Our community partners in Columbus Junction and West Liberty have already brainstormed various health campaign designs and have agreed to assemble and maintain community advisory boards to inform and oversee jointly-pursued activities.","Address;Adipocytes;Air;Back;Behavioral;Cell Culture Techniques;Chicago;Child;Cohort Studies;Collection;Communities;Data;Data Discovery;Data Reporting;Development;Educational workshop;Excision;Exposure to;Freedom;Future;Gases;Goals;Harvest;Health;Health Campaign;Home;Human;Indoor environment;Information Resources;Inhalation;Intervention;Iowa;Laboratories;Lighting;Link;Location;Measures;Metabolic syndrome;Modeling;Modernization;Obesity;Outcome;Paint;Parents;Participant;Personal Satisfaction;Phase;Pigments;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Public Health;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Risk Assessment;Sampling;School-Age Population;Schools;Series;Source;Students;Technology;Testing;Time;Toxic effect;United States;United States Environmental Protection Agency;Universities;Varnish;Work;air sampling;base;cohort;community engagement;community involvement;contaminated sediment;design;education resources;environmental change;experimental study;improved;in vivo Model;innovation;lipid biosynthesis;meetings;member;neurotoxic;novel;prevent;prospective;remediation;school district;statistics;superfund chemical;superfund site;teacher","Community Engagement Core","NARRATIVE: Community Engagement Core The ISRP Community Engagement Core will inform current and future interventions in school buildings that will decrease airborne PCB exposures for school-aged children and staff.

"No NIH Category available","SUMMARY: Iowa Superfund Research Program OverallThe Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) is a center of research excellence focused on polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs). PCBs were widely produced in the mid-20th century and used in thousands of products fromcommon household items to construction materials until the chemicals were banned 40 years ago. Todaypeople are still exposed to PCBs indoors and in communities surrounding Superfund sites. Recent ISRPresearch demonstrated that airborne PCBs present an especially urgent problem: Inhalation of airborne PCBsmay be the most significant route for human exposure to these important toxic chemicals. The ISRPs long-term goal is to develop recommendations to prevent and/or limit human exposure to airborne PCBs and toimprove the health and well-being of the population. The ISRP renewal will focus on PCBs in air particularly inbuildings (especially schools) and those emitted from contaminated waters (including Superfund sites). We willexamine the health impacts of inhaled PCBs particularly on adolescents with a focus on neurodevelopmentaland metabolic effects. The ISRP will accomplish its long-term goal through the following integrated SpecificAims: 1) Clarify the biochemical mechanisms of toxicity of lower-chlorinated PCBs in adolescence. Twoprojects will address how PCBs and their metabolites are risk factors for altered neurodevelopment duringadolescence and the mechanisms by which these compounds interfere with lipid metabolism. 2) Definesusceptible populations assess exposure and accumulation of these compounds (particularly inschools) and evaluate the relative importance of airborne vs. dietary exposure. Three cohorts ofmothers and adolescents will help us evaluate individuals exposure to airborne PCBs the specificenvironments that contribute to inhalation exposure and its importance compared to exposure through diet. 3)Reduce emissions of airborne PCBs from building materials products and contaminated sediments.We will investigate sources of airborne PCBs in indoor environments determine the magnitude of emissionsfrom contaminated waters and identify cost-effective strategies to remove or reduce emissions.

Talbert Ph.D. seeks to become an independent principal investigator studying muscle wasting dueto a variety of conditions including cancer. Cancer-induced muscle wasting a component of the cancercachexia syndrome is a significant healthcare problem with few treatment options. Cancer cachexia leads topoor patient quality of life and decreased patient survival. Pancreatic cancer patients are particularly affectedby cachexia with perhaps 85% of all pancreatic cancer patients experiencing some weight loss. Additionallymuscle wasting not tumor burden is the cause of death for at least 25% of pancreatic cancer patients.Prevention and treatment of cancer-induced muscle wasting will improve survival and quality of life for patientswith many different types of cancers.Dr. Talbert's K99/R00 Transition to Independence application The Extracellular Matrix in Muscle Atrophyseeks to understand the mechanisms behind cancer-induced muscle wasting.

"Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Spinal Muscular Atrophy","Summary: Humans have two nearly identical copies of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene SMN1 and SMN2.Low SMN levels due to deletion and/or mutation of SMN1 lead to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) a majorgenetic disease associated with infant mortality. SMN2 fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1 due toskipping of exon 7. Since the full-length mRNAs of both genes code for identical proteins correction of SMN2exon 7 splicing provides one of the best therapeutic options. We discovered Intronic Splicing Silencer N1 (ISS-N1) as a promising therapeutic target for an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated correction of SMN2exon 7 splicing. Nusinersen (SpinrazaTM) an ISS-N1-targeting ASO was recently approved by the FDA (USA)as the first drug for the treatment of SMA. While nusinersen has been successful in halting deaths of a vastmajority of SMA infants and slow the disease progression problems still persist with respect to the speed andextent of recovery. Hence there is an urgent need to develop alternative and/or complementary mechanism-based therapies for an improved treatment of SMA. This proposal is aimed at understanding the transcription-coupled splicing regulation (TCSR) of the SMN genes to uncover novel therapeutic targets for enhancing SMNlevels from SMN2. This project is based on the premise that transcription initiation and elongation regulate bothSMN2 transcripts levels and SMN2 exon 7 splicing. Our proposed study will combine several complementaryand powerful techniques including native elongating transcription sequencing (NET-seq) precision nuclearrun-on sequencing (PRO-seq) in vivo structure probing and affinity purification of complexes deposited on thenascent RNAs during transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II). To ensure the feasibility of our study wehave generated a SMN2 super minigene comprised of the full-length SMN2 promoter all exons their flankingintronic sequences and the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of SMN2. We are proposing this study in the light ofa related discovery that SMN genes produce a vast repertoire of circular RNAs (cRNAs or circRNAs). In Aim 1we will test the hypothesis that cis-elements within both the promoter and the transcribed region of SMN2regulate transcription (initiation and elongation) and consequently influence whether exon 7 will be included orskipped. Employing PRO-seq we will analyze pol II pause sites during transcription of SMN in different celltypes. We will determine if transcription pause sites are involved in TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. We will assess theeffect of small molecules including transcription and splicing modulators on TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. We willalso determine if transcription and splicing modulators affect the generation of SMN cRNAs. We will analyzetissues from SMA mouse models to determine if cRNAs generated by SMN have relevance to SMApathogenesis. Employing a library of SMN2 super minigenes we will uncover the role of promoter elements insplicing of SMN2 exon 7. We will also examine if DNA methylation of specific sites within SMN2 has any effecton TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that specific factors that are recruited duringtranscription regulate both SMN2 transcript levels and SMN2 exon 7 splicing. Using the SMN2 super minigenewe will screen for promoter-associated factors involved in TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. We will employ recentlyestablished affinity-based techniques to identify and characterize proteins associated with the transcriptionelongation complexes (ECs) recruited at the proximal promoter as well as at the gene body and terminationsites of SMN2. We will analyze ECs by mass spectroscopy. We will validate the role of the identified factors inTCSR of SMN2 exon 7 by overexpressing and depleting them. We will determine if any of these EC-associatedfactors are aberrantly expressed in tissues of mouse models of SMA. We will also examine the role of thenewly identified long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) harboring Alu-like sequences in TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. InAim 3 we will test the hypothesis that RNA structures is involved in TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. Regions that areinvolved in relevant structure formation will be selected based on pol II pause sites identified by PRO-seq dataand on in silico prediction by the Mfold program. We will validate the role of structures in the context of theSMN2 super minigene. We will confirm the presence of RNA structures by in vivo and in vitro structure probing.We will test a potential impact of any coordinated interactions between the promoter region and the RNAstructure on TCSR of SMN2 exon 7. We will also examine the potential role of DHX9 an RNA helicase inTCSR of SMN2 exon 7 and biogenesis of SMN cRNAs. We will perform a limited study to uncover potentialfunctions of the top four cRNAs. We will examine if the depletion of these cRNAs has any effect on SMNtranscription SMN exon 7 splicing and SMN levels.We will also determine the effect of the depletion on theoverall transcriptome and proteome. Findings will reveal novel therapeutic targets for improved and/orcomplementary therapies for SMA. Outcome will advance our understanding of SMN2 gene regulation andidentify novel disease modifiers of SMA.","3&apos; Untranslated Regions;Affect;Affinity;Affinity Chromatography;Alu-Like Repetitive Sequence;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Biogenesis;Cessation of life;Code;Complementary therapies;Complex;Coupled;DNA Methylation;DNA Polymerase II;DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase;Data;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Elements;Ensure;Exons;FDA approved;Gene Expression Regulation;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Diseases;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Human;In Vitro;Infant;Infant Mortality;Lead;Length;Libraries;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Molecular;Motor Neurons;Mutation;Nuclear;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pharmacotherapy;Play;Promoter Regions;Proteins;Proteome;RNA;RNA Helicase;RNA Splicing;Recovery;Regulation;Regulatory Element;Role;Running;SMN1 gene;SMN2 gene;Site;Speed;Spinal Muscular Atrophy;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Transact;Transcript;Transcription Elongation;Transcription Initiation;Untranslated RNA;Untranslated Regions;base;cell type;circular RNA;exon skipping;experimental study;improved;in silico;in vivo;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;overexpression;programs;promoter;recruit;small molecule;survival motor neuron gene;therapeutic target;transcriptome","Splicing regulation of spinal muscular atrophy genes","Project NarrativeThis proposal is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanism of SMN2 splicing with the goal ofuncovering novel regulatory elements that could be exploited for an improved therapy of spinalmuscular atrophy (SMA) a leading genetic cause of infant mortality.

"Bioengineering; Biomedical Imaging; Cancer; Nanotechnology; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Urologic Diseases","Project Summary/Abstract: Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder is the fifth most common formof cancer in the U.S. with over 80000 new cases expected in 2019. For early-stage carcinomas patientsreceive intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy or transurethral resection of the bladdertumor (TURBT) with intravesical chemotherapy. Both are associated with a high rate of recurrence andeventual progression. BCG fails many patients who are immunocompromised or who experience adversereactions while TURBT with chemotherapy fails because the chemotherapeutic agent is not sufficientlyretained in the bladder to penetrate lesions that arent resected. Thus there is a need for an improved drugformulation for early-stage (CIS Ta T1 T2) TCC capable of 1) penetrating the tumor beyond the superficialcell layers and 2) increasing the dwell/contact time between the chemotherapeutic agent and the cancer cells.To that end NanoMedTrix (NMTx) has developed a particle based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN)that carries known chemotherapeutic agents and is designed to improve their specificity dwell time and tumorpenetration. Our Phase I SBIR project exceeded our goals and demonstrated the safety and efficacy of the MSNparticles in carrying and releasing epirubicin in vivo in a murine TCC orthotopic model and in vitro using culturedhuman TCC cells. Through our participation in the NIH I-CORPS program we spoke with key opinion leaders(urologic oncologists) in the clinical bladder cancer space. As a result we are completing our Phase I work usingthe MSN to deliver clinically relevant doses of gemcitabine docetaxel and mitomycin-c in the same model.Following our Phase I success our Phase II SBIR is designed to complete the acquisition of data required bythe FDA for initiation of IND approval of NMTx MSN in human clinical trials. Specific Aim 1 describes thenecessary in vitro tasks: optimizing particle chemistry and validating our larger canine model using cultured cellsand canine TCC organoids. Specific Aim 2 describes completion of murine orthotopic studies and the start ofpre-clinical trials in dogs with spontaneously occurring TCC. Specific Aim 3 lays out our plan for carrying outcGMP synthesis packaging and analysis of our IND.Beyond setting the stage for FDA IND approval and first-in-human clinical trials Phase II completion willstrengthen our position with investors/partners in the pharmaceutical industry with whom we will partner in SBIRPhase IIB Phase III and beyond to expand clinical trials and ultimately commercialize the technology. We arecontinuing to work with the urology contacts we made in I-CORPS who are eager to participate in clinical trialsand we have received interest from Pharma companies (Bristol-Myers Squibb Urovant and others). Ourproprietary technology will provide licensees with improved performance from established chemotherapeuticsthat have already gone off-patent thus making our technology attractive both clinically and commercially.Ultimate commercial success of this SBIR work will greatly benefit human health while reducing medical costs.","Address;Adult;Adverse event;Adverse reactions;Alpha Particles;Animal Model;Animal Testing;Animals;BCG Live;Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Therapy;Bladder;Bladder Neoplasm;Cancer Patient;Canis familiaris;Carcinoma;Carcinoma in Situ;Cells;Chemistry;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Contracts;Cultured Cells;Cyclic GMP;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Dose;Drug Formulations;Drug Industry;Drug Kinetics;Ensure;Epirubicin;Evaluation;Funding;Future;GMP lots;Goals;Gravid;Health;Health Care Costs;Hour;Human;Immune system;Immunocompromised Host;In Situ;In Vitro;Innovation Corps;Iowa;Lead;Lesion;Licensing;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Medical;Medical Care Costs;Mitomycin C;Modeling;Monitor;Mus;Oncologist;Organoids;Pain;Papillary;Patients;Penetration;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacy facility;Phase;Pilot Projects;Positioning Attribute;Private Sector;Privatization;Process;Production;Property;Recurrence;Research;Resected;Safety;Ships;Silicon Dioxide;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Spasm;Specificity;Technology;Teratogenic effects;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Toxicology;Transitional Cell Carcinoma;Translating;Transurethral Resection;Ultrasonography;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Urination;Urology;Work;base;bladder transitional cell carcinoma;cGMP production;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chemotherapeutic agent;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;college;commercialization;contrast imaging;cost;data acquisition;design;detrusor muscle;docetaxel;first-in-human;follow-up;gemcitabine;improved;in vitro testing;in vivo;interest;intravesical;mouse model;nanomaterials;nanoparticle;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;off-patent;particle;preclinical study;preclinical trial;programs;prototype;response;scale up;screening;side effect;standard care;standard of care;success;tumor;tumor growth;urologic","Ultrasound-based diagnostic and monitoring of bladder cancer treatment with drug released from nanoparticles","Project NarrativeIn bladder cancer BCG immunotherapy and intravesical chemotherapy are superficial and are associated withhigh rates of recurrence and progression; hence there is a need for novel therapies that 1) are retained longerby the tumor cells specifically; and 2) penetrate the tumor to its origin in the detrusor muscle.

"Brain Disorders; Chronic Pain; Headaches; Migraines; Neurosciences; Pain Research","Perivascular mechanisms of CGRP-induced migraine symptomsProject SummaryMigraine is a debilitating neurological condition involving the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide(CGRP). It affects 15% of the population and is the second leading cause of years lived with a disability.Indeed over 40% of women will experience migraine during their lifetime. An exciting development is therecent FDA approval of a new class of CGRP-targeted drugs designed to prevent migraine. However a criticalneed remains because these drugs do not work for all patients. To improve the efficacy of CGRP-based drugsand pave the way for new drug development we need to know more about how CGRP works in migraine. Theobjective of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which CGRP acts at both peripheral and central sitesto trigger migraine-like symptoms. The scientific premise is that migraine involves increased sensitivity toCGRP which is supported by clinical studies that have shown CGRP is both required and sufficient to causemigraine. During the past funding period we developed transgenic mice that are sensitized to CGRP actions.The CGRP-sensitized mice have elevated expression of a subunit of the CGRP receptor called humanreceptor activity-modifying protein 1 (hRAMP1). We found that CGRP causes a migraine-like symptom(photophobia) by distinct but possibly overlapping actions in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery.Here we propose to measure migraine-like symptoms in wildtype and hRAMP1 transgenic mice using lightaversion as an indicator of photophobia and touch sensitivity and grimace as indicators of pain. Wehypothesize that CGRP acts at perivascular sites in the dura and thalamus to cause migraine-like symptoms ofphotophobia and pain. Specifically we propose that CGRP-induced vasodilation in the periphery alters thetrigeminovascular microenvironment and that centrally it facilitates the action of CGRP as a neuromodulator inthe posterior thalamic region. The first aim will test whether peripheral CGRP mechanisms involve actions onblood and lymphatic vessels and resident mast cells in the dura. The second aim will test whether centralCGRP mechanisms involve perivascular and neuromodulatory actions in the posterior thalamic nuclei.Complementary genetic and pharmacological strategies will be used in both aims. These studies will provideinsight into the mechanisms that enable CGRP to act both centrally and peripherally via the vasculature toaffect sensory functions in a neurological disorder. Despite advances in our understanding of migraine over thepast decade many questions remain unanswered in part due to the paucity of appropriate animal models. Theuse of our novel CGRP-sensitized hRAMP1 mice represents an innovative approach for challenging thecurrent dogma regarding the vascular roles of CGRP in the periphery and brain. The outcome of this proposalwill be the uncovering of perivascular CGRP actions in the dura and CNS that induce migraine-like symptoms.Importantly this will facilitate development of vascular-targeted and CNS-penetrant therapeutics for migraine.","Affect;Animal Model;Behavior;Biological;Blocking Antibodies;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain region;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Calcitonin-Gene Related Peptide Receptor;Clinical;Clinical Research;Closure by clamp;Complex;Data;Development;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;Dura Mater;Endothelial Cells;Fiber;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Headache;Human;Injections;Knowledge;Light;Lymphocyte;Measures;Migraine;Modeling;Mus;Neuraxis;Neurogenic Inflammation;Neurologic;Neuromodulator;Neuropeptides;New Agents;Outcome;Outcome Study;Pain;Patients;Peptide Signal Sequences;Pericytes;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Photophobia;Play;Population;Posterior Thalamic Nuclei;Public Health;Research;Retina;Role;Sensory;Sensory Disorders;Signal Transduction;Site;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Societies;Symptoms;Systemic blood pressure;Tactile;Testing;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;Tissues;Touch sensation;Transgenic Mice;Vasodilation;Woman;Work;allodynia;base;cell type;central sensitization;chronic painful condition;clinically relevant;disability;drug development;experience;experimental study;improved;innovation;insight;lymphatic vessel;mast cell;mouse model;nervous system disorder;neuroregulation;new therapeutic target;novel;novel drug class;novel therapeutics;optogenetics;overexpression;pain signal;parabrachial nucleus;prevent;receptor;receptor-activity-modifying protein;therapeutic target;vascular contributions","Perivascular mechanisms of CGRP-induced migraine symptoms","RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTHMigraine represents a significant burden to society.

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Women's Health","Project Summary / Abstract G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell surface receptors that represent thehighly desirable drug targets for diverse diseases including cancer. Despite their importance ourunderstanding of how GPCRs contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression remains limited becausethere are over 350 non-sensory GPCRs and many of them are aberrantly expressed in cancer cells. Thisproposal aims to delineate the function and mechanisms of a subgroup of GPCRs Gi/o-GPCRs in regulatingthe self-renewal and tumorigenic activities of stem cell-like breast tumor-initiating cells (TICs). We will test theidea that targeting Gi/o-GPCRs can eliminate TICs and restore patient response to current therapeutics. As a model of our studies we focus on ErbB2/HER2-positive breast cancers because they are highlyaggressive and have poor prognosis. HER2-targeted therapy is the preferred treatment for these cancers butdrug resistance is the major hurdle. The mechanisms underlying drug resistance remain largely unknown butare attributed to a reservoir of TICs in tumors. TICs may escape therapy in part because they find ways totransactivate HER2 via other pathwaysincluding pathways mediated by GPCRs. Our preliminary studies found Gi/o-GPCRs were overexpressed in human HER2-amplified breast cancercell lines and mouse TICs from HER2-driven mammary tumors and were required for growth of TICs in vitroand in vivo. Using our transgenic mouse lines that allow us to upregulate or block Gi/o signaling in aninducible manner specifically in mammary epithelial cells we further showed HER2-driven spontaneousformation of mammary tumors and lung metastases requires Gi/o-GPCR signaling. These exciting data led toour proposal's central hypothesis: HER2-driven breast tumors harbor a reservoir population of TICs thatupregulate Gi/o-GPCR signaling; and this hyperactivates EGFR/HER2 permitting TICself-renewal andultimately promoting tumor growth and metastasis. We propose that disrupting Gi/o-GPCR signaling might bea way to ablate TICs prevent resistance and maintain effectiveness of HER2-targeted therapeutics.Our proposal uses multimodal approaches includinggenetic and patient-derived xenograft mousemodels of breast cancer. With this powerful toolkit we will determine the mechanisms of upregulated Gi/osignaling in TICs to increase TIC tumorigenicity and drive cancer development (Aim 1); elucidate if Gi/o-GPCRs function in part through transactivation of EGFR/HER2 via the activation of Gi/o/c-Src and G-PI3Ksignaling axes to drive cancer progression (Aim 2); and finally test whether blocking Gi/o-GPCR signaling caneliminate TICs and enhance sensitivity to current treatment regimens for HER2+ breast cancer (Aim 3).

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Kidney Disease","Project SummaryChronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of the general population. The prevalence of cardiachypertrophy is markedly increased in CKD patients reaching as high as 90% in advanced stages of CKD.Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death for CKD patients; among which cardiac hypertrophy is animportant underlying cause. Risk factors for cardiac hypertrophy in CKD include CKD-specific risk factors as wellas conventional risk factors (hypertension and volume expansion etc). Several CKD-specific risk factors havebeen proposed but their roles remain inconclusive. Klotho is a membrane protein predominantly produced in thekidney. The extracellular domain of Klotho (soluble klotho; sKL) is released into the systemic circulation andfunctions as a soluble endocrine hormone. Serum levels of soluble Klotho are decreased in human CKD patientsand in mouse models of CKD. We recently reported that sKL protects the heart by inhibiting TRPC6-mediatedabnormal Ca2+ signaling and that membrane lipid rafts are receptors for sKL. Our over-arching hypothesis is thatsKL binds lipid rafts to exert cardiac protection and that sKL deficiency is a cause of uremic cardiac hypertrophy.To support this hypothesis along with the long-term goal of developing potential treatment we propose two aims.Aim-1 will identify and develop potential sKL-mimetic that exerts organ protection by binding and targetingsialogangliosides and lipid rafts. We will produce recombinant sKL and sKL-mimetic proteins and examine theireffects to bind sialoganglioside moiety in vitro and to protect organ in vivo. Aim-2 will further elucidate themolecular mechanism for sKL regulation of TRPC6-mediated abnormal Ca2+ signaling. Supported by thepreliminary data we will test the hypothesis that TRPC6-containing vesicles are pre-docked to lipid rafts and thatbinding of cationic amino acids in the C-terminal region of TRPC6 to PIP3 (stimulated by PI3K) in the inner leafletof raft membrane is important. Furthermore we will examine molecular mechanism by which DAG stimulatesTRPC6 vesicle exocytosis thereby sKL inhibits TRPC6 function. We will use combined biochemicalelectrophysiological and imaging approaches. Our proposed studies in mice will provide important pre-clinicalinformation that may lead to treatment of CKD-induced cardiomyopathy. Furthermore upregulation of TRPC6and abnormal Ca2+-calcineurin-NFAT signaling is critical for sustaining and amplifying pathological cardiachypertrophy and remodeling from diverse causes. Klotho-based therapeutic strategies may be applicable todiverse cardiac diseases..","Affect;Age-Months;Amino Acids;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Blood Circulation;C-terminal;Calcineurin;Calcium;Carbohydrates;Cardiac;Cardiomyopathies;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cations;Cause of Death;Cell Line;Cell physiology;Cessation of life;Chronic Kidney Failure;Clinical Data;Data;Development;Docking;Down-Regulation;Electrophysiology (science);Endocrine;Epidemic;Exocytosis;Extracellular Domain;Extracellular Space;Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors;General Population;Goals;Growth;Growth Factor;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Hypertrophy;Homeostasis;Hormones;Human;Hypercalcemia;Hypertension;Hypertrophy;In Vitro;Integral Membrane Protein;Kidney;Lead;Length;Lipid Binding;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Lipids;Membrane Microdomains;Membrane Proteins;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Muscle Contraction;Mutation;Myocardial dysfunction;Organ;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Patients;Permeability;Phase;Phosphotransferases;Play;Prevalence;Principal Investigator;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Recombinants;Regulation;Reporting;Risk Factors;Role;Serum;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Structure;Tertiary Protein Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Up-Regulation;Vesicle;Vitamin D;base;calcification;cardioprotection;experimental study;imaging approach;in vivo;inorganic phosphate;mimetics;mortality;mouse model;mutant;paracrine;pre-clinical;premature;programs;receptor;sialogangliosides;supervitaminosis;uremic cardiomyopathy","Klotho and chronic kidney disease","Project NarrativeChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health epidemic that affects ~10% of the general population andincreases cardiovascular mortality of affected patients.

"Mental Health; Neurosciences","This revised application requests continuation of funding for a successful and long-standing training program(dating back to 1991). At a critical juncture of change in leadership the program strives to maintain a strongfoundation with the opportunity for growth and restructuring. Rebranded as the Iowa Neuroscience SpecialtyProgram In Research Education (INSPIRE) this program seeks to integrate training in translationalneuroscience with an emphasis on a lifespan trajectory perspective. Our approach is to re-shape and reframeour research opportunities based on the NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project by focusing onmechanisms of psychopathology based on functional dimensions rather than the diagnostic criteria that definepatient populations. The ultimate goal is to train a group of young investigators who will combine a high level ofsophistication about the complexities of the human brain's functional domains how these systems developover time and the mechanisms that may lead to pathologic functioning. .This program is at a pivotal point in time. Nancy Andreasen a pioneer of brain imaging in the study ofschizophrenia conceptualized and directed this program from 1991 until now. The current Co-PI of theprogram Peg Nopoulos is an alumnus of the program herself and will now be responsible for directing theprogram. She is joined by John Wemmie the new Co-PI of the program. This change in leadership hasafforded the opportunity to retain the solid foundation but also to re-shape the program substantially in twobroad areas: 1) a focus on the study of neurobiologic mechanisms of psychiatric illness across the lifespanand 2) implementing a more highly structure training program with emphasis on translational science.In expanding the content of the program beyond the major psychoses we partner with a new and growingMolecular Psychiatry division adding six new MD/PhD and PhD scientists as mentors. This helps expand theprogram to include basic science PhDs a new phenotype of fellow and allows for the creation of aninterdisciplinary cohort or trainees. This mix of types of trainees adds an addition layer of exposure totranslational research with a strong emphasis on team science.Central to the training program is the Master's in Translational Biomedicine (TBM) program which is hosted byour Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). This program is designed to be individualized andflexible. The INSPIRE program will recruit a total of 4 fellows at the post-doctoral level who are MD MD/PhDor PhD trained. Each fellow will be `matched' with an outstanding mentor as well as a mentor team to overseethe primary activity of mentored research activity. In addition each fellow will develop a program through theTBM that suits their needs while fulfilling requirements (such as Training in Responsible Conduct in Research)utilizing both formal didactics and career development activities. A degree (certificate or Master's) is an optionbut not a requirement.

"Autoimmune Disease; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Digestive Diseases; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Immunotherapy; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARYSjgren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediateddestruction of lacrimal and salivary glands leading to vision-threatening dry eye diseaseprofound dry mouth and overall decreased quality of life. The immunopathogenesis of Sjgrensyndrome is poorly understood and treatments fail to halt the autoimmune destruction of thetargeted glands. There is a critical need to identify mechanisms of disease initiation to overcomebarriers to designing effective therapies. Disease initiation precedes clinical manifestations byyears (even decades) precluding such studies in humans. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) micedevelop spontaneous autoimmunity of lacrimal and salivary glands with several featuresresembling Sjgren syndrome in humans including the central role of T cells in mediating theautoimmune attack on these glands. We have recently discovered that lacrimal glandautoimmunity in NOD mice requires interleukin 27 (IL27) and type I interferons (IFN). Thesecytokines are complex with both immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects dependingon the context. Thus directly targeting IL27 or type I IFN may not be appropriate in thetreatment of Sjgren syndrome. The long-term goal of our research is to identify newtherapeutic targets for Sjgren syndrome. Our objectives in this proposal are to identifymechanisms by which IL27 and type I IFN drive lacrimal gland autoimmunity in the NOD mousemodel of Sjgren syndrome. Our central hypothesis is that innate immune signals (eg type IIFN) promote lacrimal gland antigen presenting cells to produce IL27 which drives pathogeniceffector T cells to target lacrimal glands. Our specific aims to test this hypothesis are: (1) Identifythe cellular targets of IL27 and downstream effects on effector T cells required for lacrimal glandautoimmunity; (2) Define the upstream triggers of IL27 including the role of type I IFN in drivingmale-specific lacrimal gland disease. We will use the NOD mouse-based spontaneous diseasemodel genetically edited NOD strains our adoptive transfer model bone marrow chimeras andin vitro cultures to pursue these studies. The significant positive impact of completing thesestudies includes identifying mechanisms by which human disease-relevant cytokines drive T celldysregulation in lacrimal gland autoimmunity which will lead to novel therapies to halt theautoimmune attack. Given the roles of IL27 and type I IFN in other autoimmune diseases thesefindings may lead to therapies for other autoimmune diseases as well.","Address;Adoptive Transfer;Affect;American;Androgens;Animal Model;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;Automobile Driving;Bone Marrow;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Characteristics;Chimera organism;Clinical;Complex;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease model;Dry Eye Syndromes;Etiology;Event;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Gland;Goals;Histologic;Homing;Human;Immune;Immune mediated destruction;Immune response;Immune signaling;Immune system;Immunologics;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Inbred NOD Mice;Inflammation;Interferon Type I;Interferons;Interleukins;Invaded;Knowledge;Lacrimal gland structure;Lead;Lymphocyte;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Non obese;Oral health;Organ;Outcome;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Production;Quality of life;Research;Role;SCID Mice;Salivary Glands;Serum;Signal Transduction;Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome;Stimulus;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Tissues;Vision;Xerostomia;autoimmune inflammation;autoimmune pathogenesis;autoimmune rheumatologic disease;base;cellular targeting;chronic autoimmune disease;cytokine;design;diabetic;draining lymph node;effective therapy;effector T cell;human disease;immunoregulation;in vivo;male;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;ocular surface;prevent;programs;response","Cytokines driving T cell dysregulation in lacrimal gland autoimmunity","PROJECT NARRATIVESjgren syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to severe dry eye disease withpotential for vision-threatening complications.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Neurosciences; Prevention; Radiation Oncology","Radiation exposure during cancer treatment can cause significant cardiac morbidity andmortality both acutely and years after the initial exposure. These short and long-termcomplications are increasingly important as new therapies for cancer are developed andsurvival improves. Radiation can directly damage the myocardium cause coronary artery andvalvular disease disrupt cardiac innervation and precipitate myocardial fibrosis; this cansubsequently lead to systolic and diastolic dysfunction along with atrial and ventriculararrhythmias. In addition radiation therapy is often given concomitantly with chemotherapy and itis difficult to sort out the direct effects of radiation. The detailed mechanisms underlying thesusceptibility to tachy- and bradyarrhythmias following radiation therapy have not been defined.We now show that short and long-term total body and cardiac targeted irradiation in mice leadsto oxidative stress conduction system disease serum miR-34a upregulation arrhythmias andincreased mortality which were prevented in part by treatment with the water soluble oxetanylsulfoxide compound MMS350 that was developed as a radiation mitigator at the University ofPittsburgh. We also show that Nitric Oxide Synthase 1 knockout (Nos1-/-) mice develop moresevere conduction disease associated with increased mortality that Nos1 genotype alters theeffects of radiation on mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolicpathways that Nos1 genotype alters the metabolic response to MMS350 following irradiation.Our primary hypothesis is that NOS1 and microRNAs play heretofore unrecognized roles inradiation-induced damage to the heart and cardiac conduction system by mitigating changes inoxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction that lead to electrophysiological remodeling andarrhythmias and that MMS350 can mitigate the arrhythmogenic phenotype by protectingcellular metabolism and energetics. To test these hypotheses we will use total body andcardiac targeted irradiation of wild type and genetically engineered mice to determine themechanisms by which conduction disease and arrhythmias result from damage to cardiacmyocytes vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells and/or the autonomic nervous systemand to determine the mechanisms by which NOS1 MMS350 and microRNAs alter the damage.These studies will define the role of Nos1 and microRNAs in cardiac conduction andarrhythmias following radiation exposure and test pharmacological therapies that may mitigatethis potentially lethal side effect of a life-saving cancer therapies.","Acute;Affect;Arrhythmia;Autonomic nervous system;Biological Markers;Bradyarrhythmias;Calcium;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiac conduction system;Chronic;Coronary artery;Data;Disease;Distant;Echocardiography;Electrocardiogram;Electrophysiology (science);Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Energy Metabolism;Exposure to;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Fibrosis;Functional disorder;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Genotype;Heart;Heart Atrium;Histology;Ion Channel;Ionizing radiation;Ischemia;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Lead;Life;Link;Malignant neoplasm of thorax;Measures;Mechanics;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;MicroRNAs;Mitochondria;Morbidity - disease rate;Morphology;Mus;Myocardium;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I;Oxidative Stress;Pathology;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Predisposition;Production;Radiation;Radiation exposure;Radiation induced damage;Radiation therapy;Reactive Oxygen Species;Risk;Role;Savings;Serum;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Structure;Sudden Death;Sulfoxide;System;Tachyarrhythmias;Telemetry;Testing;Time;Tissues;Universities;Up-Regulation;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Ventricular Arrhythmia;Water;Whole-Body Irradiation;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;coronary fibrosis;exosome;experimental study;heart innervation;improved;irradiation;mRNA Expression;mitochondrial dysfunction;molecular marker;mortality;nerve supply;novel therapeutics;overexpression;prevent;protective effect;protein expression;radiation effect;radiation mitigator;response;side effect;voltage clamp","Mechanisms of Arrhythmias Following Cardiac Irradiation","Exposure of the heart to ionizing radiation during the treatment of thoracic cancers can lead to cardiacarrhythmias and sudden death.

"Biotechnology; Lung; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human; Transplantation","Project Summary:End-stage lung diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lung transplantation is anexcellent treatment option for patients with this condition yet 50% of recipients die within five years due to thedevelopment of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) in the allograft. Epithelial stem cell depletion is suggested tocontribute to the development of OB; however there is little research being performed to test this hypothesisprimarily due to the lack of animal models for OB that develop allograft pathology resembling that seen inhumans. We recently developed a novel orthotopic lung transplant model in the ferret that models human OBvery well. Using this model we have shown for the first time in ferret and human allografts that the number ofclonogenic K5+p63+ basal stem cells (BSCs) progressively declines in proximal and distal airways of the allograftas the severity of OB increases. Additionally our research is the first to demonstrate that the proximal airwaysubmucosal gland (SMG) a facultative niche for BSCs in the surface airway epithelium (SAE) is an early targetof immune destruction in human and ferret allograft airways. In mice the SMG stem cell niche serves only thetrachea; however in larger mammals such as humans and ferrets SMGs are present throughout thecartilaginous airways. Using lineage tracing we have shown that the myoepithelial cells (MECs) of SMGs areprecursors of multipotent K5+p63+ BSCs in the SAE. During the development of OB the destruction of SMGstem cell niches in the allograft occurs simultaneously with phenotypic and functional changes to multipotentK5+p63+ BSCs in the SAE. We hypothesize that destruction of the denervated SMG in the allograft and thusdepletion of MECs leads to a decline in multipotent K5+p63+ BSCs in the SAE and to increases in committedmultipotent (K5+p63+K14+) bipotent (K5+K14+ p63+K14+) and unipotent (K14+) basal cells all of which have areduced capacity for self-renewal. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the functionalsignificance of the phenotypic changes in the MECS and the lineage-committed basal cells and how denervationof the SMG alters Wnt signaling (Lef-1/TCF1) required for both the maintenance of the SMG stem cell niche andlineage commitment of glandular MECs to SAE BSCs in the setting of injury. Additionally a major preclinicalobjective of this proposal is to elucidate the ability of stem cells to engraft into a transplanted lung and repairinjury thus laying the foundation for the development of stem cell therapy to delay or prevent OB in lungallografts. We will achieve these objectives by addressing the following specific aims: 1) Determine howdestruction of the SMG stem cell niche contributes to depletion of K5+p63+ BSCs. 2) Identify consequences oflung denervation on airway stem cells and their niches. 3) Determine the potential for airway stem celltransplantation in preventing or delaying OB. We expect that delineating the mechanisms of stem cell depletionin the airways of transplanted lungs will be a major step forward in understanding OB pathogenesis and willinform the use of stem cells as a therapeutic approach to prevent or delay OB.","3-Dimensional;Abnormal Cell;Address;Allografting;Animal Model;Autologous;Basal Cell;Biological Assay;Bronchiolitis;Caring;Cause of Death;Cell Lineage;Cell Therapy;Cell surface;Cells;Clinical;Data;Denervation;Development;Disease Progression;Distal;Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase;Epithelial;Ferrets;Fibrosis;Foundations;Genes;Gland;Goals;Human;Immune Targeting;Immune mediated destruction;Impairment;In Vitro;Injections;Injury;Investigation;Knock-out;Knowledge;Lead;Left;Lobar;Lobe;Location;Lung;Lung Transplantation;Lung diseases;Maintenance;Mammals;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myoepithelial;Myoepithelial cell;Organoids;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Property;Publishing;Rattus;Regenerative capacity;Regulation;Reporter;Research;Reserve Stem Cell;Role;Severities;Signal Transduction;Stem Cell Development;Stem cell transplant;Structure;Surface;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Trachea;Transgenes;Transgenic Organisms;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation;WNT Signaling Pathway;Xenograft procedure;airway epithelium;cartilaginous;editorial;effective therapy;epithelial stem cell;epithelium regeneration;exhaustion;human model;implantation;in vivo;injury and repair;lung allograft;lung regeneration;mortality;novel;novel therapeutics;overexpression;pre-clinical;prevent;public health relevance;regeneration following injury;repaired;self-renewal;stem cell niche;stem cell therapy;stem cells;transcription factor;transplant model","Pathogenesis of Airway Stem Cell Abnormalities in Obliterative Bronchiolitis","Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance:End-stage lung disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality and by 2030 will be the third leadingcause of death worldwide.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Hematology; Infectious Diseases; Sepsis","Candidemias represent the 4th most common type of bloodstream infection and with only threecommonly used antifungal drugs available treatment options are threatened by drug resistance.Infections linked to Candida glabrata represent the second most common type of candidemia and havebeen increasing since the early 2000s. C. glabrata exhibits a robust ability to acquire resistance to azoledrugs the most commonly used class of antifungal compounds. Isolates that are azole resistant areroutinely found to contain gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the PDR1 gene encoding a transcriptionfactor that is a central regulator of drug resistance. These GOF forms of Pdr1 drive constitutively highlevels of transcription of target genes. Central among these is the ATP-binding cassette transporter-encoding CDR1 locus. Cdr1 is a drug efflux pump that prevents the accumulation of toxic azole levels inthe cell. The target of azole drugs is the lanosterol -14 demethylase enzyme encoded by the ERG11gene. ERG11 transcription is induced by azole drug challenge through the action of the Upc2Atranscription factor. The transcriptional regulatory circuits defined by Pdr1 and Upc2A have previouslybeen treated as separate pathways to azole resistance. We recently discovered that Upc2A controlstranscription of both PDR1 and CDR1 indicating the presence of a physiological tie between theseregulatory networks. In this proposal we plan on dissecting the mechanism(s) used by Pdr1 to activategene expression and dissect the interaction between Pdr1 and Upc2A at the levels of target gene DNA-binding and transcription. In aim 1 we will determine the functional contribution made by coactivatorproteins that we have found by mass spectrometry to co-purify with Pdr1. Epitope-tagging and genedisruption alleles will allow determination of how these proteins interact with and modulate the ability ofPdr1 to regulate gene expression. Aim 2 will identify protein targets interacting with the Pdr1 C-terminaltranscriptional activation domain that are responsible for recruitment of the transcriptional Mediatorcomplex and induction of gene expression. We will also use cross-linking approaches to identify proteinsthat interact with this domain as well as potential negative regulatory domains within Pdr1. Finally wewill use a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing andRNA-sequencing to determine the mutual impact Pdr1 and Upc2A have on co-regulated genes.

"Genetics","Project Summary/AbstractRNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation control plays a major role in regulating transcriptionthroughout development and differentiation of multi-cellular organisms. The process ischaracterized by the default action of negative elongation factors including NELF and DSIF thathalt transcription of initiated polymerases near promoters. These promoter-proximal pausedpolymerases are either released from the template by TTF2 or other termination factors or areallowed to enter productive elongation through the selective action of the positive elongationfactor P-TEFb. The cyclin dependent kinase activity of P-TEFb is regulated by reversibleassociation with the 7SK snRNP mediated by HEXIM proteins. The main goal of this proposal isto further define the mechanisms utilized to control Pol II elongation and to enable efficienttranscription through nucleosomes. We will use newly developed biochemical methods andglobal techniques to elucidate mechanisms enabling transcription through chromatin the role ofpaused Pol II in maintaining promoter accessibility and the role of cyclin dependent kinases andthe PAF1 complex in elongation control. We will also determine how the key elongation controlfactor P-TEFb is regulated by the 7SK snRNP and examine the role of mRNA cap methylationin elongation control. The principle investigator is a professor at the University of Iowa and thisproject will be carried out in the excellent environment offered by his lab and the facilities in theUniversity of Iowa Carver College of Medicine.

"Biotechnology; Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections; Women's Health","Project SummaryChlamydia trachomatis (C.t.) is the leading cause of non-congenital blindness and the most prevalent sexuallytransmitted bacterial infection in the world and thus has a major impact on global health. C.t. replicates in amembrane-bound vacuole termed the inclusion that is extensively modified early in infection through theincorporation of over 50 type III secreted effector proteins termed inclusion membrane proteins (Incs). Fromwithin the confines of the inclusion the bacterium must engage select host organelles to obtain key nutrientssuch as lipids and iron for bacterial replication and inclusion expansion. Despite the importance of nutrientacquisition to chlamydial infection a major gap in our knowledge exists regarding how C.t. acquires theseessential substrates from the host cell. Recent work from our group shows that the Inc protein CT229 binds andrecruits Rab GTPases and specific Rab effectors to the inclusion. Using cutting-edge genetics we showed thatthe absence of CT229 results in defects in intracellular replication and inclusion development. We hypothesizethat CT229-Rab interactions direct post-Golgi vesicles and recycling endosomes to the inclusion for theacquisition of essential substrates needed for proliferation and inclusion expansion. In Aim 1 we will determinehow CT229-Rab interactions promote lipid acquisition by hijacking host vesicular trafficking pathways and ironacquisition by promoting the recruitment of transferrin-positive vesicles to the inclusion. We will evaluate the lipidcomposition of the bacterial and inclusion membranes and evaluate the importance of lipid acquisition forincorporation into the inclusion and bacterial membranes. We will also answer a major long-standing question inthe field by determining whether transferrin indeed serves as a major source of iron for chlamydia andfurthermore mechanistically probe the mechanisms by which chlamydia may extract iron from this pathway. It isunlikely that CT229 alone controls vesicle hijacking from start to finish therefore in Aim 2 we will identify thecomplex of host and bacterial proteins that are formed at the inclusion during CT229-Rab interactions. Usingcellular genetic and molecular techniques we will evaluate the impact of Inc-Inc interactions on Rab-dependentvesicle transport to the inclusion. Detailed characterization of the bacterial and host proteins that co-opt hostvesicular trafficking during C.t. infection will provide a holistic view of how intracellular pathogens coordinate thecapture and fusion of host vesicles that are necessary for bacterial infection.","Address;Animals;Antibiotics;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Bacterial Proteins;Binding;Blindness;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Ceramides;Chlamydia;Chlamydia Infections;Chlamydia trachomatis;Complex;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Ectopic Pregnancy;Endosomes;Etiology;Genetic;Goals;Golgi Apparatus;Growth;Impairment;Incidence;Infection;Infertility;Integration Host Factors;Iron;Knowledge;Label;Lipids;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Metabolic;Microtubules;Molecular;Nutrient;Organelles;Paper;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Pelvic Inflammatory Disease;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Process;Proteins;Recurrence;Recycling;Reporting;Role;SNAP receptor;Sexual Transmission;Sexually Transmitted Diseases;Source;Techniques;Therapeutic Intervention;Trachoma;Transferrin;Vacuole;Vesicle;Work;base;genetic manipulation;global health;insight;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutic intervention;pathogen;rab GTP-Binding Proteins;recruit;trafficking;trans-Golgi Network;vesicle transport","Functional characterization of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion membrane proteins and their role in subversion of host vesicular trafficking","Project Narrative Chlamydia trachomatis is the etiological agent of blinding trachoma and a sexually transmitted infectionthat can result in serious complications including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) ectopic pregnancy andinfertility.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","Project Summary1. Cholinergic anthelmintics including levamisole and pyrantel are used for the control of nematode parasites. We have found that cholinergic anthelmintics are not a homogenous functional class of drugs. These anthelmintics select for different subtypes of acetylcholine- gated ion-channel receptors (nAChRs) in muscle of parasitic nematodes. The different nAChR subtypes are produced by varied combinations of five subunit proteins: each subunit may be produced by a different gene. We will exploit our advances with RNAi quantitative motility studies molecular pharmacology and patch-clamp to study the diversity and dynamic nature of nAChR subtypes of Brugia malayi: a parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. This parasite is an excellent specific and general nematode parasite model. It is tractable to study with techniques that permit functional studies of genes that produce the different subunits of the nAChR subtypes involved in parasite neuromuscular transmission.2. The classic cholinergic anthelmintic levamisole selectively activates muscle L-subytpe nAChRs producing spastic contraction in parasitic nematodes. In Brugia adults responses to levamisole decline over an hour but responses to other cholinergic anthelmintics do not. Why is there this loss of anthelmintic effect (tachyphylaxis) and why is there a difference between cholinergic anthelmintics? Here we will identify the dynamic functions and interactions of different nAChR genes and a mechanistic explanation for anthelmintictachyphylaxis.3. Our approach in Aim #1 will be to characterize molecularly and pharmacologically the four or more nAChRs subtypes present on Brugia somatic muscle. In Aim #2 we will identify the functions of nAChR subunit genes by using RNAi on Brugia adults to produce different phenotypes and to alter muscle responses to different cholinergic anthelmintics. In Aim #3 we will test the hypothesis that populations of receptor subtypes are dynamic compensating for the effects of anthelmintic exposure; we will determine how the L-subtype nAChRs behave during tachyphylaxis.4. The proposal is innovative using a combination of techniques for the study of functional properties of filarial nAChR ion-channels genes. To our knowledge we are the only lab that has been able to combine these techniques successfully for the study of nematode parasites.5. The overall impact by an innovative combination of techniques we will discover important new information on: the functional properties of filarial nAChR genes sensitive to anthelmintics; the dynamic nature of different receptor subtypes and; the loss of functional receptors and expression of genes associated with anthelmintic tachyphylaxis","Acetylcholine;Adult;Affect;Albendazole;Anthelmintics;Brugia;Brugia malayi;Cells;Characteristics;Cholinergic Agonists;Cytoplasm;Diethylcarbamazine;Disease;Dissociation;Dose;Double-Stranded RNA;Drug Targeting;Filarial Elephantiases;Filariasis;Financial compensation;Gene Combinations;Gene Expression;Genes;Hour;Insecta;Ion Channel;Ion Channel Gating;Ivermectin;Larva;Levamisole;Modeling;Molecular;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Muscle Contraction;Nature;Nematoda;Nicotine;Parasites;Parasitic nematode;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Population;Preparation;Prevention;Property;Prophylactic treatment;Protein Subunits;Pyrantel;Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR;RNA Interference;Receptor Gene;Recovery;Reporting;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Tachyphylaxis;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;cell motility;cholinergic;filaria;functional loss;innovation;interest;knock-down;knowledge base;molecular subtypes;neglected tropical diseases;neuromuscular transmission;patch clamp;programs;receptor;receptor expression;response;spasticity;vaccine access","Pharmacological Diversity of nAChRs in Clade III Nematodes: Brugia malayi","Project NarrativeAnthelmintics are used for the control of nematode parasites.

"Aging; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease","ABSTRACT SUMOylation is a dynamic post-translational modification which involves theconjugation of SUMOs (Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifiers) to the lysine residue/s of targetproteins affecting their function localization or stability. Recent studies have reportedthat SUMOylation (SUMO2/3) promotes vascular endothelial dysfunction andaccelerates atherosclerosis. This application aims to explore a redox-dependentmechanism for the deleterious effect of SUMO2ylation in the vasculature and identify anovel target of SUMO2 in the vascular endothelium. We have observed that SUMO2 overexpression in endothelial cells promotesoxidative stress and impairs endothelial function via the master redox regulator p66Shc.Furthermore we have observed that p66Shc is directly modified by SUMO2 on a criticallysine that regulates the oxidative property of p66Shc. Based on this evidence wehypothesize that SUMO2ylation of p66Shc is a key molecular mechanism drivingvascular oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. We have generated endothelium-specific SUMO2 transgenic mice as well astransgenic mice expressing non-SUMO2ylatable p66Shc in the endothelium and wholebody knockin mice expressing non-SUMO2ylatable p66Shc. We will leverage thesemice as well as tools to manipulate SUMO2ylation of p66Shc in vitro to answer threefundamental questions: 1) does SUMO2 expression in the endothelium promoteendothelial dysfunction and accelerate atherosclerosis; 2) is SUMO2ylation of p66Shcresponsible for SUMO2-induced endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; and 3)how does SUMO2ylation of p66shc promote endothelial oxidative stress. Answers to these important questions will establish the role of SUMO2 as a post-translational modification that impairs vascular endothelial function and promotesatherosclerosis via p66Shc. Advancing this knowledge could potentially lead to SUMO2-directed therapies for atherosclerotic vascular disease.","Affect;Arterial Fatty Streak;Atherosclerosis;Automobile Driving;Bioavailable;Biological Assay;Biological Availability;Blood Vessels;Breeding;Cells;Cessation of life;DNA Modification Process;Data;Deposition;Development;Disease;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Experimental Animal Model;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Health;Heat-Shock Proteins 70;Hyperlipidemia;ICAM1 gene;Impairment;In Vitro;Knock-in Mouse;Knock-out;Knowledge;Lead;Low-Density Lipoproteins;Lysine;Measures;Mitochondria;Molecular;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Myocardial Ischemia;Nitric Oxide;Organ;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Paralysed;Phosphorylation;Physiological;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Production;Property;Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reporting;Risk Factors;Role;Stroke;Sumoylation Pathway;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Ubiquitin;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Endothelium;Vascular blood supply;Vasodilation;base;endothelial dysfunction;inflammatory marker;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;p66(ShcA) protein;sensor;tool;vascular endothelial dysfunction;vascular inflammation","SUMO2-p66shc axis in vascular endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis","Project NarrativeDisease in blood vessel leads to either reduction or stoppage of blood supply to the organ leadingto organ malfunction or even death.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYBacterial multidrug efflux transporters confer resistance to structurally diverse antimicrobials which is one of themajor causes for clinical treatment failure. Campylobacter jejuni is a major enteric pathogen and has developedvarious mechanisms for antibiotic resistance. Recently both the World Health Organization and the Centers forDisease Prevention and Control have designated Campylobacter as a serious antibiotic resistance threat. InCampylobacter the multidrug efflux pump CmeABC a RND-type efflux system plays a key role in the resistanceto various antimicrobials and in intestinal colonization by mediating bile resistance. In CmeABC the threeproteins assemble to form a powerful tripartite machinery allowing direct efflux of substrates across bothmembranes of the Gram-negative cellular envelope. CmeABC is essential for C. jejuni as it has an importantnatural function for bile resistance which is required for Campylobacter colonization in animal intestine. TypicallyCmeABC requires to function cooperatively with other resistance mechanisms (such as target mutations) toconfer clinically relevant antibiotic resistance. However a super resistance-enhancing variant of CmeABC (RE-CmeABC) has recently emerged in clinical isolates of C. jejuni. This variant pump has a distinct CmeB sequenceand is much more potent in conferring multidrug resistance. Additionally we found that RE-CmeABC isincreasingly prevalent in clinical isolates and mediates exceedingly high-level resistance to fluoroquinolone aclinically important antibiotic for treating campylobacteriosis. Our preliminary data further suggest the enhancedefflux function of RE-CmeABC is due to sequence variations in the RE-CmeB transporter. To begin to understandhow CmeABC extrudes antimicrobials we have initiated work to decipher the structural basis of CmeABC-mediated efflux. Our preliminary crystallization data indicate that CmeB forms a homotrimer where individualprotomers bind to and export substrates independently. Based on the solid preliminary data we propose in thisapplication to pursue three specific aims to 1) identify the specific mutations responsible for the enhanced effluxfunction in RE-CmeABC 2) define the structural basis of CmeB-mediated antibiotic efflux and how sequencepolymorphisms affect the structure-function relationship and 3) determine the horizontal spread of RE-cmeABCand its impact on C. jejuni fitness in the absence and presence of antibiotic selection pressure. We will use ahigh throughput mapping strategy a CRISPR-Cas9 based technique for efficient gene editing and replacementin vitro and animal model systems x-ray crystallography and single-molecule FRET to achieve the goals of thethree specific aims. The team of investigators have strong and complementary expertise and are uniquelypositioned to conduct the proposed work which is expected to reveal novel mechanisms used by an RND-typetransporter for antibiotic extrusion and enhanced multidrug resistance. This gained knowledge should betransferrable to other bacterial efflux pumps and the findings may facilitate the development of new strategiesto control the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant Campylobacter.","Affect;Amino Acids;Animal Model;Animals;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotics;Bile fluid;Binding;Biological Models;CRISPR/Cas technology;Campylobacter;Campylobacter infection;Campylobacter jejuni;Carbapenems;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Chimeric Proteins;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Coculture Techniques;Colistin;Crystallization;Culture Media;Data;Databases;Development;Diarrhea;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Structures;Goals;Human;Image;In Vitro;Individual;Intervention;Intestines;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Ligands;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Fusion;Membrane Transport Proteins;Multi-Drug Resistance;Mutation;Pathogen detection;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Play;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Proteins;Protomer;Public Health;Pump;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resort;Solid;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;System;Techniques;Treatment Failure;Variant;Work;World Health Organization;X-Ray Crystallography;antibiotic efflux;antimicrobial;bacterial fitness;base;clinically relevant;co-infection;conformational conversion;coping;efflux pump;enteric pathogen;experimental study;fitness;fluoroquinolone resistance;genome sequencing;gut colonization;human pathogen;insight;novel;pathogenic bacteria;periplasm;pressure;resistance mechanism;single-molecule FRET;therapy development;transmission process;whole genome","Emerging multidrug resistance mechanisms in Campylobacter","RelevanceAntibiotic resistant Campylobacter is a serious antibiotic resistance threat to public health.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome; Muscular Dystrophy; Myotonic Dystrophy; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACTEfficient DNA repair is a double-edged sword. Accurate repair of such deleterious DNA lesions as double-stranded breaks inter-strand crosslinks and damaged replication forks promotes genome stability. It alsoallows cancer cells to acquire a more aggressive character and develop resistance to radiation and DNAdamaging chemotherapeutics. Additionally untimely deployment and/or misregulation of the DNA repairmachines may further destabilize the genome (which can lead to cancer) or may result in the accumulationof toxic repair intermediates (which can lead to cell death). Significant gaps remain in our understanding ofthe molecular events that funnel the intermediates of otherwise accurate repair into rogue genome-destabilizing mechanisms.This research program emphasizes the molecular machinery of homologous recombination how it isintegrated into DNA replication repair and recombination (the 3Rs of genome stability) and how it ismisappropriated in the molecular pathways that process stalled DNA replication events and DNA breaksthrough highly mutagenic genome destabilizing mechanisms.Our central hypothesis is that the activities of the RAD51 recombinase the ssDNA-binding protein RPArecombination mediators BRCA2 (in human) and Rad52 (in yeast) and DNA repair helicases are finely tunedby a variety of factors which include posttranslational modifications interacting partner proteins specific DNAstructures and DNA lesions.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary:More than a million residents live in nursing homes in the United States at a cost of about 55 billion dollars toMedicaid. Nursing home quality has been a longstanding concern among policymakers. Adequatereimbursements are essential to improve quality in nursing homes. Although state and the federal governmentsjointly finance Medicaid states have created various supplemental payment programs that rely on funds fromthe providers and local governments to finance the non-federal share. Supplemental payment program fornursing homes owned/operated by non-state governmental organizations (NSGOs) is one such program underwhich NSGOs contribute the states share of the supplemental payment to the state government throughintergovernmental transfers. The state then claims federal matching dollars for the supplemental payment andtransfers the supplemental payments to the NSGO-owned nursing home. Nursing homes and NSGOs sharethese funds based on their contract and nursing home expenditures. This program allows states to increaseMedicaid reimbursement for NSGO-owned nursing homes without substantial burden on state budgets.Indiana offers a unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of the supplemental payment program to NSGO-owned/operated nursing homes because NSGOs bought/leased about 90% of nursing homes in Indiana duringthe past decade. In 2017 NSGO-owned nursing homes in Indiana received about 700 million in additionalfederal dollars under this program. Anecdotal newspaper articles suggest that NSGOs keep a large portion ofthe supplemental payments and that staffing has not improved in NSGO-owned nursing homes. Policymakersare increasingly concerned that NSGOs are using the supplemental payment program to boost their ownrevenues instead of helping improve the quality of nursing homes. Our objective is to evaluate theeffectiveness of Indianas supplemental payments to NSGO-owned nursing homes in increasing nursing homerevenue and expenditures and improving nursing home staffing and patient safety. To achieve this goal wepropose an econometric analysis for three specific aims: 1) To estimate the effect of supplemental payments toNSGO-owned facilities on nursing home revenue/expenditures 2) To estimate the effect of supplementalpayments to NSGO-owned facilities on direct care staffing (RN LPN and Nurse-aide); and 3) To estimate theeffect of supplemental payments to NSGO-owned facilities on patient safety outcomes (pressure ulcersinfections falls and medication errors). Our results have the potential to affect CMS policies on states use ofnursing home supplemental payment program by providing rigorous estimates on whether these payments hadthe intended effect of improving nursing home quality. Our results will provide empirical evidence for state andnational policymakers on whether these programs represent efficient allocation of resources to improve nursinghome quality."," ","Medicaid Supplemental Payments and Nursing Home Quality  a Case Study of Indiana","Project Narrative: The proposed project evaluates the effectiveness of Indianas supplementalpayment program to non-state government-owned nursing homes in increasing nursing homerevenue and expenditures and improving nursing home staffing and patient safety.

Dr. Cifras career development planincorporates mentored research and training in advanced epidemiology and biostatistics qualitative/mixedmethods research and communication to improve diagnostic performance. She will be mentored by a team ofexperienced investigators with expertise in epidemiological and qualitative investigation of patient safety prob-lems and specific proficiency in diagnostic safety and communication. Dr. L. Herwaldt (primary mentor) is anaccomplished epidemiologist with an established record of mentoring successful young investigators. Dr. H.Singh is an internationally known pioneer in pediatric diagnostic safety research with specific expertise in com-munication to improve diagnosis. Dr. H. Reisinger is a medical anthropologist with expertise in mixed methodsresearch. Dr. J. Dawson is a proficient biostatistician who has collaborated on a wide variety of federally-funded biomedical research. Dr. Cifra works in an environment extremely supportive of her success and hasaccess to all of the resources required to achieve her goals. Diagnostic errors (DEs) are a major source ofhealthcare-associated harm in critically ill children. However a large gap in our understanding of the diagnosticprocess on admission to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) prevents the development of targeted strate-gies to prevent DE-related harm. To address this gap Dr. Cifra proposes a mixed methods study with the ob-jective of developing a PICU-specific conceptual model of referral communication as an integral part of thePICU diagnostic process. She will achieve this by: 1) determining the prevalence of DE in the first 12 hoursafter non-elective admission to the PICU and patient provider and work system characteristics associatedwith DE and 2) examining how the manner and content of referral communication between referring cliniciansand accepting PICU physicians affect the PICU diagnostic process on admission. For quantitative Aim 1 Dr.Cifra will conduct a retrospective cohort study using structured chart reviews and a validated tool to identifyDEs in patients admitted to 2 tertiary referral academic PICUs. For qualitative Aim 2 Dr. Cifra will conduct fo-cused ethnography (observation interviews and document review) at the University of Iowa PICU to examinehow referral communication affects the PICU diagnostic process on admission. Quantitative and qualitativeresults will be integrated producing a novel PICU-specific conceptual model of referral communication and itsrole in the diagnostic process on PICU admission. The proposed research is innovative in its integrated multi-disciplinary mixed methods approach. Results will be significant generating hypotheses for future diagnosticsafety research and providing information to prevent DE-related harm in children an AHRQ priority population.This work will provide the foundation for Dr. Cifras planned R01 application to develop and test these interven-tions accelerating her progress towards independence."," ","Understanding Referral Communication the Diagnostic Process and Diagnostic Error in Pediatric Critical Care","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research seeks to develop a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)-specific conceptual model ofreferral communication as an integral part of the PICU diagnostic process.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome","The goals of this application are to apply tools and refine methodologies forgenome engineering in zebrafish that allow the creation of mutagenic and conditionalalleles that provide spatial and temporal control of gene expression. In doing so we will be ableto define genes that aid in the development and implementation of methodology to improve ourunderstanding of genetic manipulations that can promote or restore health. The ability to makesite-specific untagged mutant alleles in zebrafish and other models has been greatly advancedby custom nucleases that include TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operateon the same principle: they are designed to bind to specific sequences in the genome andcreate a double strand break. During the first granting cycle we have leveraged this ability todevelop reliable methods for site-specific gene integration directed by short regions ofhomologous sequence. In our renewal application we utilize the tools vectors andmethodologies generated to create both revertible alleles and Cre/Cre-ER lines for the zebrafishcommunity in Aim 1. In Aim 2 we will examine methodologies to improve site-specificintegration and the role of microhomology at CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites and new ways to presentthe vector with microhomology to the genomic cut site. In Aim 3 we will continue to develop andimplement targeted integration resources by hosting workshops and onsite visits at both theMayo Clinic and Iowa State University. The tools techniques and zebrafish lines produced willhave direct implications for providing precise gene editing techniques and critical lines toexamine genes with the potential to restore human health. We anticipate these methodologieswill enhance the efficiency of gene editing and will be readily adaptable for use in other modelorganisms and large animals. In our opinion this will have important implications for modelinghuman disease in animal systems through the ability to utilize conditional alleles.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences","PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive control is an umbrella term that describes processes that regulate cognitive perceptual andmotor functions needed to perform adaptive goal-directed behaviors. Patients with neurological and psychiatricdisorders for example schizophrenia attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) traumatic brain injury andstroke suffer from impairments in cognitive control. Although the function of frontoparietal and striatal circuits incognitive control have been extensively studied increasing evidence suggests a role for the thalamus. Thalamicnuclei have reciprocal and non-reciprocal connections with multiple cortical regions integrate modulatory inputsfrom other subcortical structures and innervate both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. Despite thisprominent connectivity profile the role of the human thalamus in cognitive control and effects of its dysfunctionare not well understood. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the cognitive control functionsof the human thalamus. Our central hypothesis based on our extensive preliminary data and anatomicalproperties of thalamocortical circuits in animal models is that thalamic nuclei support cognitive control bymodulating cortical activities that include evoked responses cortical network interactions and neural oscillations.These cortical activities instantiate neurocognitive processes that select or maintain task-relevant informationand they can be selectively amplified through targeted increases in thalamocortical interactions. Consequentlythalamocortical dysfunction can lead to cognitive rigidity increased distraction and poor planning. To test ourhypothesis we propose a novel approach that integrates cognitive behavioral tasks that specifically manipulateprocesses that select and maintain task-relevant information (for example working memory and set switching)multimodal neuroimaging (fMRI and EEG) and human thalamic lesions studies. We will first determine thefunctional organization (topography) of thalamocortical functional connectivity for cognitive control (Aim 1) whichhas not yet been systematically mapped in humans. We will then determine how thalamocortical interactionsselect and maintain task-relevant information by examining its relationship with and modulatory effects on task-related cortical activities (Aims 2 and 3). For all studies we will recruit healthy individuals patients with focalthalamic lesions and control patients from a lesion comparison group. By collecting multimodal neuroimagingdata from patients with focal thalamic lesions we will determine how the disruption of thalamocortical interactionsaffects task-related cortical neural activities and behavior. Results from our proposed research will establish howthe distribution of thalamocortical connectivity enables thalamic nuclei to participate in multiple cognitive controlfunctions and specify the cognitive and neural repercussions of thalamocortical dysfunction observed in patientswith thalamic stroke as well as other disorders such as ADHD and schizophrenia.","Affect;Anatomy;Animal Model;Anterior;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Cell Nucleus;Clinical Treatment;Cognitive;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Exhibits;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Goals;Human;Image;Impairment;Individual;Lead;Lesion;Maintenance;Maps;Mental disorders;Mission;Morphology;Motor;Neurocognitive;Neurons;Neuropsychology;Neurosciences;Pathway Analysis;Patients;Pattern;Play;Process;Property;Public Health;Publishing;Pulvinar structure;Records;Research;Resolution;Role;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Specific qualifier value;Stroke;Structure;System;Task Performances;Testing;Thalamic Nuclei;Thalamic structure;To specify;Traumatic Brain Injury;United States National Institutes of Health;base;cognitive control;cognitive function;cognitive rigidity;cognitive system;cognitive task;comparison group;distraction;experimental study;functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography;individual patient;innovation;insight;member;multimodality;nervous system disorder;neuroimaging;novel strategies;recruit;relating to nervous system;response;translational neuroscience","Cognitive Control Functions of the Human Thalamus","PROJECT NARATIVEThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it will advance our understanding of how the humanthalamus contributes to goal-directed behaviors (cognitive control).

Yet effective implementation ofevidence-based interventions that reduce CVD-related morbidity and mortality remains a substantial challenge.The Patient-Centered Medical Home including self-management personalized health records and team-basedcare is a strategy to improve care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Building upon this frameworkwe developed an innovative team-based intervention the Cardiovascular Risk Service (CVRS) which includesa centralized pharmacist-led cardiovascular risk service and prevention services (e.g. vaccinations cancerscreenings) model to support primary care providers with CVD management and achievement of keyperformance measures. Results from one of our previous NIH-funded clustered-randomized trials showed adecrease in CVD risk factors in CVRS intervention patients receiving care through private physician offices.However we discovered many more barriers to adoption of the CVRS in large health centers in anotherongoing trial than the major positive support we received in small rural private clinics. Our long-term goal is toimprove CVD management through team-based primary care. The application objective is to test thescalability of the CVRS in 12 large organizationally and culturally diverse (diverse) hospitals and health-systems many with high proportions of minority and underserved patients using a pragmatic cluster-randomized design. Scaling-up the CVRS will require an assessment of adoption implementation andmaintenance for broader dissemination and implementation. Our central hypothesis is that barriers andfacilitators to CVRS implementation will vary across diverse primary care offices. We will use atransdisciplinary approach in collaboration with national experts in educational policy to measure thesevariances by means of mixed methods including interviews observations and surveys. The proposed studyrationale is a novel implementation approach to improve CVD management and prevention services inpatients with complex medical histories and will lead to innovative strategies for broader adoption by US healthsystems. Grounded in the RE-AIM framework we will accomplish our objective and test our central hypothesiswith these specific aims: Aim 1: Identify understand and develop strategies for overcoming barriers to theadoption implementation and maintenance of the CVRS in diverse primary care offices. Aim 2: Determine thereal-world reach and effectiveness of the CVRS in diverse primary care offices. Aim 3: Determine CVRSsustainability and adaptation in diverse primary care offices. Our approach is innovative because it will ask:How can implementation processes be improved and maintained? as well as Can implementation andmaintenance be tailored to real-world primary care providers so that they desire expansion to underservedpatients?

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Epilepsy; Lung; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","PROJECT SUMMARYSudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with refractoryepilepsy. Findings from SUDEP cases and from animal models of seizure-induced death suggest that centralapnea is critical for SUDEP. The mechanisms underlying seizure-induced inhibition of breathing during SUDEPare unclear and therefore no known preventive strategies exist. Candidate: Dr. Brian Dlouhy M.D. is aneurosurgeon at the University of Iowa whose clinical practice focuses on the surgical treatment of epilepsy.This proposal will be critical for his continued development as a neurosurgeon-scientist. This proposal willallow his research to build upon his established interest in how the amygdala modulates the neural control ofrespiration will produce novel scientific results and will provide critical training for Dr. Dlouhy. Dr. Dlouhysultimate goal is to become an R01-funded academic neurosurgeon-scientist with an independent researchprogram exploring neural control of respiration. Environment: The University of Iowa provides a rich trainingenvironment for Dr. Dlouhy and he has the full support from the Carver College of Medicine and his Chair inthe Department of Neurosurgery Dr. Matthew Howard. Dr. Dlouhy has combined a unique team of mentorseach leaders of their respective fields and who possess expertise instrumental to Dr. Dlouhys research plan:amygdala circuitry neural control of respiration and human brain neurophysiology. Dr. George Richerson isan expert in the field of respiratory neurophysiology; Dr. John Wemmie is a leader in the field of amygdalaneurobiology; Dr. Matthew Howard is an expert in human electrophysiology. Research: Using intracranialrecordings in epilepsy patients Dr. Dlouhy previously found that apnea occurs when seizures propagate to theamygdala. Electrical stimulation of the amygdala can lead to apnea that is not associated with air hunger(dyspnea) or urge to breathe. Volitional control of respiration is spared during stimulation-induced apnea;subjects can speak normally and breathe when prompted. The underlying neural mechanisms by which theamygdala influences the brains respiratory control network to mediate these effects or regulate normalbreathing are unknown. This proposal aims to identify and characterize neural activity within the amygdala andits functional connections with brain respiratory control sites. Dr. Dlouhy will also study how experimentalneuromodulation of the amygdala affects volitional versus automatic breathing and the perception of dyspnea.These aims will be accomplished using a combination of direct electrophysiological recording and stimulationtechniques electrical stimulation concurrent with fMRI and respiratory physiology experiments. The proposedscientific research plan the excellent mentorship team of Drs. Richerson Wemmie and Howard and theenthusiastic support of the candidates institution and department will enable Dr. Dlouhy to launch a successfulcareer as an independent neurosurgeon-scientist.","Address;Affect;Air;Air Movements;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Animal Model;Apnea;Behavior;Brain;Brain Stem;Breathing;Carbon Dioxide;Cause of Death;Central Sleep Apnea;Cessation of life;Chemoreceptors;Chronic;Complement;Cues;Data;Development;Disease;Doctor of Medicine;Dyspnea;Electric Stimulation;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Environment;Epilepsy;Event;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Funding;Goals;Human;Hunger;Hypercapnia;Impairment;Institution;Intractable Epilepsy;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Mediating;Medicine;Mentors;Mentorship;Methods;Neurobiology;Neurons;Neurosurgeon;Operative Surgical Procedures;Output;Patients;Perception;Performance;Positioning Attribute;Prevention strategy;Prosencephalon;Research;Respiration;Respiratory physiology;Scientist;Seizures;Series;Signal Transduction;Site;Spinal Cord;System;Techniques;Testing;Training;Universities;Volition;awake;career;central pattern generator;clinical practice;college;design;experience;experimental study;human subject;improved;interest;nervous system disorder;neuromechanism;neurophysiology;neuroregulation;neurosurgery;neurotransmission;novel;novel therapeutics;programs;relating to nervous system;respiration regulation;respiratory;response;skills;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy;theories","Amygdala modulation of volitional versus automatic breathing","PROJECT NARRATIVESudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with chronicrefractory epilepsy and there are no known preventive strategies.

In these proposed studies we will use both Ebola virus (EBOV) and a BSL2 model virus of EBOV to identify the CD40+ cellular compartment(s) required for protection and understand the breadth of cell populations that use CD40 signaling to control EBOV infection. Elucidation of these cell populations will elucidate targeted approaches that can lead to therapeutic interventions.","Acute;Address;Adoptive Transfer;Antiviral Agents;Antiviral Response;Cell membrane;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Dendritic Cells;Development;Disease Outbreaks;Ebola virus;Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein;Endothelial Cells;Environment;Epithelial Cells;Event;Fibroblasts;Filoviridae Infections;Filovirus;Genes;Glycoproteins;IFNGR1 gene;IL12RB1 gene;Immune;Immune response;Infection;Infection Control;Innate Immune Response;Interferon Type II;Interferons;Interleukin-12;JUN gene;Knowledge;Lead;Ligation;Maintenance;Mediating;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myelogenous;Natural Immunity;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Peritoneal;Peritoneal Macrophages;Peritoneum;Population;Production;Public Health;Receptor Signaling;Recombinants;Regulation;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Stomatitis;TNFRSF5 gene;TNFSF5 gene;TRAF6 gene;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;Vaccines;Viral Pathogenesis;Viral load measurement;Viremia;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;adaptive immunity;cell type;cytokine;immunoregulation;in vivo;innate immune pathways;intraperitoneal;macrophage;mortality;new therapeutic target;receptor;recruit","CD40 regulation of acute virus infection","Macrophages serve as an initial host cells for a number of acute viral infections including filoviruses such as Ebola virus yet cell signaling events that initiate innate immune responses and alter virus replication are incompletely understood.

Depression and sleep disorders manifest decades before disease onset and may serveas an important early biomarker. Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exhibitneurofibrillary changes in the early stages of AD which may contribute to some of these early non-cognitivesymptoms. The goal of this application is to determine whether tau accumulation in 5-HT DRN neurons inducesdepressive-like behaviors and disordered sleep leading to chronic sleep disruption. These sleep deficits in turnmay promote hyperexcitability of 5-HT neurons and lead to neurodegeneration. The increased activity in 5-HTneurons due to sleep deprivation also facilitates the spread of tau pathology to the entorhinal cortex (EC) anotherregion that is impacted early in the course of AD. Loss of 5-HT inputs from the DRN to the EC will disinhibitneurons that project to the hippocampus precipitating tau spread and the onset of cognitive and memoryproblems. In Aim 1 we will use in vivo fiber photometry to measure neural activity in 5-HT neurons during testsof depressive-like behavior in mouse models of tauopathy to see if the normal function of these neurons isnegatively impacted. We will also monitor 5-HT activity during sleep to see if that is altered by tau pathology. InAim 2 we will examine the effect of sleep deprivation on 5-HT neuronal excitability and the progression of taupathology in the brain using electrophysiology and 3D imaging. The role of increased neural activity in 5-HTneurons on the spread of tau pathology will also be examined using chemogenetic manipulations of neuralactivity. In Aim 3 we will determine whether tau-induced loss of 5-HT inputs to the EC alters 5-HT signaling inprincipal neurons that project to the hippocampus. We will also establish a role for 5-HT/5-HT2A receptor signalingin the spread of tau pathology to the hippocampus and the onset of cognitive deficits. In total the proposedresearch will provide essential information concerning the impact of tau pathology on early behavioral symptomsof AD and the later development of cognitive and memory deficits.","Affective;Age;Agreement;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Appearance;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Behavior Disorders;Behavioral;Behavioral Symptoms;Biological Assay;Brain;Brain region;Chronic;Clinical Data;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Data;Denervation;Deterioration;Disease;Disinhibition;Early Diagnosis;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Etiology;Exhibits;Expectancy;Fiber;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Hyperactivity;Impaired cognition;Intervention;Investigation;Lead;Measures;Mediating;Memory;Memory impairment;Mental Depression;Microinjections;Monitor;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neurons;Onset of illness;Pathology;Periodicity;Photometry;Quality of life;Receptor Signaling;Research;Risk;Role;Scanning;Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor;Serotonin;Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2A;Signal Transduction;Sleep;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep Disorders;Sleep Fragmentations;Sleep disturbances;Slice;Symptoms;Tauopathies;Testing;Three-Dimensional Imaging;affective disturbance;age related neurodegeneration;attenuation;cognitive development;depressive behavior;depressive symptoms;dorsal raphe nucleus;early detection biomarkers;entorhinal cortex;hTau Mice;in vivo;mild cognitive impairment;mouse model;mutant;neural circuit;neurofibrillary tangle formation;neuromechanism;neuron loss;neuronal excitability;optogenetics;prevent;relating to nervous system;sleep quality;tau Proteins;tau aggregation;tau-1;transmission process","Sleep and affective disturbances in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease","Project NarrativeThe goal of these studies is to determine whether tau accumulation in serotonin neurons causes affective andsleep disturbances leading to chronic sleep deprivation and hyperexcitability in serotonin neurons andaccelerating the spread of tau pathology to the entorhinal cortex.

"No NIH Category available","ABSTRACTThis proposal addresses NIOSH sector of Healthcare and Social Assistance (HCSA) program (NAICS 62) and significantcomponents of the Immune Infectious and Dermal Disease Prevention (IID) cross sector. Over 21 million people arecovered by the HCSA program in the United States and occupational IID diseases are of the most common illnesses affectingtheir safety and health. Personal protective equipment (PPE) as major intervention means is critical for healthcare workers(HCWs) health and safety. However ineffective PPE can place HCWs and patients at risk of transmission of infectiousagents not only through direct contact with blood and body fluids but also via microbial penetration through barrier fabricsand aerosol and droplet transmission. Current PPE is not ideally suited to the needs of HCWs due to limitations in protectionand comfort such as self-contamination during doffing poor fit and inward leakage risks offered by respirators insufficientcapture of airborne pathogens difficulties in communication through materials potential fluid penetration and poorlyexecuted fit and sizing. Limitations of current PPE have resulted in infections and mortalities of HCWs in fighting againstrecent outbreaks such as Ebola SARS and COVID-19. The overall goal of this project is to develop improved PPE forHCWs with an emphasis on self-decontaminating function. In this project we will develop new textile materials with self-decontaminating property. Then we will apply both the existing material and those materials developed in this project toisolation gown and respirator. A novel design approach will be applied to create a new seamless self-decontaminating PPEsystem with superior comfort fit and functionality compared with those of any currently available PPE. The evidence-based design process will incorporate three-dimensional (3D) body scanning and kinematic motion analysis to achievegreatly improved wearability and functionality. We will use the recently developed and validated Faceseal concept todevelop a filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) made of biocidal material that will have a close-to-perfect fit. A SimulatedWorkplace Protection Factor (SWPF) will be determined for the new respirator. The overall PPE performance design willbe evaluated using instrumented manikins specifically designed human trials and performance testing. The data obtainedfrom these evaluations will be applied to further improve the newly-developed PPE components. The multidisciplinary teamis well prepared to carry out the proposed work with established knowledge and successful track records in fiber/polymerscience textiles PPE design and performance evaluation respirator design aerosol research and exercise physiology andkinesiology. The state-of-the-art facilities and equipment across the collaborating institutes are ideally suited to fulfill theresearch aims. Clinicians and epidemiologists will serve as consultants on the project offering insights and firsthandexperiences of PPE implementation and utilization. This proposed project is significant since it embraces NIOSH r2pinitiative by fundamentally directing novel PPE material and end products development and providing the technical basisin performance evaluation methods. The completion of the work will raise the horizon of PPE engineering in reducingoccupational IID diseases and targeting the intermediate goal of addressing infectious disease transmission in the HCSAsector.

This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas ofthe dataprocessing pipeline including acquisition reconstruction and analysis. Theseinnovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework(MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior informationincluding motion and models for magnetization evolution with convolutional neural networkblocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of thisframework will yield sensitive biomarkers which will be considerably less expensive than PETand does not involve radiation exposure.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurosciences","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe upper brainstem is necessary for conscious wakefulness and lesions dividing this area from the forebrainresult in deep coma. However the neurons originating this ascending arousal system and their forebraintargets necessary for maintaining conscious wakefulness have never been identified. Currently our ability todiagnose prognosticate and ultimately treat patients with disorders of consciousness is constrained by a lackof information regarding the precise location genetic identity and connections of these arousal-promotingneurons. We recently analyzed human brainstem lesions and identified an focal area in the upper brainstemthat is injured specifically and commonly in patients presenting in coma. This coma-specific area is in theregion of the parabrachial nucleus (PB) a site in which experimental lesions in rats produce deep coma. Wealso found that this coma-specific region exhibits strong and specific connectivity with the frontoinsular cortex(FI) in resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) analysis in normal human subjects. In rodents asubpopulation of PB neurons projects directly to a homologous cortical area (agranular insular cortex) so wehypothesized that PB neurons with direct projections to the frontoinsular cortex (PB-FI) are a core componentof the ascending arousal system. To test this hypothesis we will use connectivity-based mouse genetic toolsaccessing PB-FI neurons by injecting AAV6 retro-Cre into the insular cortex and then Cre-dependent vectorsin PB. This approach allows us to selectively characterize and manipulate PB-FI neurons without altering themyriad other homeostatic functions mediated by other PB neurons. We will use this approach first to identifythe full range of efferent projections of PB-FI neurons searching for any axon collaterals to subcortical regionsthat may sustain arousal in parallel with FI. We will then use fiber photometry to measure the activity of PB-FIneurons from calcium transients in awake behaving mice and correlate their activity with concurrentbehavioral state using continuous video-EEG. Finally we will activate and ablate PB-FI neurons testing ourhypotheses that they produce wakefulness and that their absence will result in coma or hypersomnolence.Information about their axon collaterals and activity patterns will enable optogenetic stimulation and inhibitionof the fiber terminals of PB-FI neurons in target- and state-specific tests of the role of each projection of PB-FIneurons in maintaining a waking state. Ultimately these experiments will shed much-needed light on a keyunanswered question in clinical neurology: which brainstem neurons and connections mediate basicconscious wakefulness?","Affect;Anesthesia procedures;Area;Arousal;Axon;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain Stem;Brain region;Calcium;Clinical;Coma;Complement;Conscious;Consciousness Disorders;Data;Diagnosis;Diphtheria Toxin;Electroencephalography;Exhibits;FOS gene;FOXP2 gene;Felis catus;Fiber;Fluorescence;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Gene Expression;Genetic;Genetic Identity;Genetic Techniques;Human;Hypersomnolence;Impairment;Implant;Injections;Injury;Insula of Reil;Ischemic Stroke;Knowledge;Label;Lesion;Light;Location;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mediating;Midbrain structure;Mus;Nervous System Trauma;Neurologic;Neurology;Neurons;Neurosciences;Pathologic;Patient Care;Patients;Pattern;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Photometry;Physicians;Pontine structure;Prosencephalon;Proteins;Rattus;Recovery;Reporter;Research Personnel;Rest;Rodent;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Sleep;System;Techniques;Testing;Tracer;Wakefulness;alpha Toxin;awake;base;clinical care;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;effective therapy;experimental study;human data;human subject;improved;in vivo;injured;mouse genetics;neuroimaging;novel;optical fiber;optogenetics;parabrachial nucleus;relating to nervous system;retrograde transport;stem;tool;vector","PB-FI connectivity and arousal","PROJECT NARRATIVENeurologic injuries often cause coma or other disorders of consciousness.

"Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Genetic Testing; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Prevention; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/Abstract 1 Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common autosomal regressive genetic disorders in the United States: 2 approximately 1 out of 32 Caucasians and 1 out of 61 African Americans is a CF carrier. A hallmark of this 3 disease is recurrent respiratory infections. However cystic fibrosis requires two copies of the CFTR 4 mutation. Traditionally one non-mutated CFTR gene was thought to be sufficient for maintaining health. 5 However a few small studies and preliminary work by our group have demonstrated that CF carriers may 6 be at increased risk for respiratory infections including recurrent sinusitis pneumonia and atypical 7 mycobacterial infections than non-CF carriers. Given an estimated population of 15 million CF carriers in 8 the United States if carriers are more likely to acquire respiratory infections the attributable burden of 9 respiratory infections and corresponding antimicrobial use attributable to the CF-carrier state may be10 substantial. Thus there is a critical need for population-based investigations to precisely determine the11 attributable risk of the CF-carrier state for respiratory infections.12 The goal of our research is to determine the role of the CF-carrier state on the risk for acquiring respiratory13 infections. Due to the frequency of genetic testing for CFTR mutations for genetic counseling it is possible14 to identify CF carriers in some existing population-based data sets. Our group has recently demonstrated15 that CF carriers are at significantly greater risk for respiratory infections compared to age and sex matched16 controls. However more work is needed that considers other patient characteristics as well as patients'17 specific CF mutations. In addition the biological plausibility of these findings needs to be established. Thus18 we will determine the natural history of respiratory infections for CF carriers using administrative claims19 data; determine the risk for respiratory infections among CF carriers in a genotyped cohort using data from20 electronic medical records and assess airway epithelial function in CF carriers compared to non-carriers.21 This work is significant because respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality; CF22 carriers are common and can be identified by current genetic counseling methods; and there are CFTR-23 modulating therapies available that may be cost-effective treatments for CF carriers with excessive24 respiratory infections. This work is innovative because all previous work in this area has been done using25 small cohorts of patients and we will have access to a large cohort of CF carriers and controls. Also we will26 be able to identify the CF carriers using diagnosis and procedure codes in administrative data and the27 medical record an in one cohort we will be able to identify specific CFTR mutations.28 Given the number of CF carriers in the general population the methods and models we develop will have29 broad implications for other diseases beyond respiratory infections.","Address;Affect;African American;Age;Area;Aspergillosis;Asthma;Bicarbonates;Biological;Biological Assay;Bronchiectasis;Bronchitis;Carrier State;Caucasians;Cell Culture Techniques;Characteristics;Chlorides;Clinical Data;Code;Communicable Diseases;Computerized Medical Record;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Data Set;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Disease;Epidemiology;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Frequencies;Future;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Gene Mutation;General Population;Genes;Genetic Counseling;Genetic Diseases;Genotype;Goals;Health;Heterozygote;Hospitalization;Human;Individual;Infection;Intervention;Investigation;Length of Stay;Longitudinal cohort;Medical Records;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mutation;Mycobacterium Infections;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;Natural History;Outcome;Pancreatitis;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pneumonia;Population;Procedures;Recurrence;Regulator Genes;Research;Respiratory Tract Infections;Risk;Risk Estimate;Role;Severities;Sinusitis;Structure of respiratory epithelium;Surface;Testing;United States;Work;airway epithelium;antimicrobial;cohort;cost effective treatment;cystic fibrosis infection;cystic fibrosis patients;design;disorder risk;electronic data;genetic testing;high risk;injured airway;innovation;mortality;population based;prevent;readmission rates;recessive genetic trait;recurrent infection;respiratory;sex","Estimating the risk for and severity of respiratory infections attributable to CFTR heterozygosity","PROJECT NARRATIVEIn the United States there are approximately 10-15 million carriers of gene mutations that causecystic fibrosis (CF) an autosomal recessive disease.

"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","PROJECT SUMMARY Cognitive impairments like over-perserveration mental rigidity and cognitive inflexibility accompanyseveral neurological diseases  most prominently Parkinson's Disease (PD). PD is the second most commonneurodegenerative disorder in humans. While it is a predominantly motor disorder many PD patients experiencecognitive symptoms. However despite the broad incidence of impaired cognitive flexibility in PD and otherdisorders little is known about the mechanistic neural underpinnings of this ability in health and disease. Hencethere is a critical need for a mechanistic neural theory of cognitive flexibility. In this grant proposal we proposeto test a working model of this ability which centers on the role of a fronto-basal ganglia (FBg) brain mechanismfor inhibition. We use a converging evidence approach that includes intracranial recordings from the basalganglia scalp EEG motor systems measurements and brain stimulation. The core hypothesis of the proposed model is that rapid cognitive flexibility depends on a neuralmechanism for inhibitory control. Based on extensive pilot data we propose that this mechanism allows healthyindividuals to adaptively disengage from ongoing cognitive processes (working memory task set representationsattentional focus etc.). Importantly the proposed neural mechanism is  until now  largely known as a motorinhibition mechanism: it can serve to stop already initiated actions by recruiting a network of FBg brain regionsto inhibit motor activity. The circuitry underlying this inhibitory control mechanism is known to be damaged in PDwhich is thought to explain some of its motor symptoms. Our proposal that this mechanism can serve to alsoinhibit cognition could explain why PD patients overpersevere on outdated cognitive processes: damage to thesame mechanism whose malfunction impairs motor inhibition in PD may also impair cognitive flexibility. To test this model the first of group of studies in this proposal is designed to identify the types of situationsin which the inhibitory FBg mechanism is engaged. Specifically neural and motor signatures of the inhibitoryFBg mechanism will be measured across different types of situations that require rapid cognitive control (errorsresponse-conflict unexpected perceptual events). The goal is to investigate whether the mechanism is active ina broad array of scenarios that demand rapid cognitive flexibility. The second group of studies aims to investigatethe potential inhibitory influence of the FBg mechanism on cognitive representations. Specifically activity of theFBg mechanism will be measured in a new battery of tasks designed to test how ongoing task set representationsand attentional processes are interrupted when necessary. The goal is to test the core proposition of the modelnamely that the FBg mechanism's inhibitory capacity extends beyond the motor system and can affect activecognitive representations. The final group of studies will test the effects of different types of brain stimulation onthe inhibitory FBg mechanism's ability to inhibit ongoing cognitive representations.

"Atherosclerosis; Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Minority Health; Neurosciences; Stroke; Women's Health","Project summaryCardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke claim more lives than all forms of cancer combined and result in animmense health and economic burden (>$316 billion annually in the United States). Current strategies toprevent acute coronary syndromes and ischemic stroke in at risk patients rely on anti-platelet drugs (e.g.aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors) which do not translate into clinical efficacy in 1/3rd of patients. More potent anti-platelet agents such as Glycoprotein IIbIIIa inhibitors (e.g. abciximab) are associated with bleedingcomplications and are not suitable for long-term use. Since CVD and stroke are characterized by thrombosisand inflammation an ideal drug would be one that inhibits thrombo-inflammatory responses without majorbleeding and activates inflammation resolution programs leading to polarization of macrophages from an M1(pro-inflammatory) to an M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. To accomplish this we are exploring an innovativestrategy to inhibit thrombo-inflammation by manipulating aerobic glycolysis in activated platelets andleukocytes. Our approach will be to target the key regulatory enzyme of aerobic glycolysis pyruvate kinase M2(PKM2). This approach takes advantage of the recent discovery that like most normal cells resting plateletsand leukocytes rely primarily on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP whereas activated platelets andleukocytes exhibit a high level of aerobic glycolysis (conversion of glucose to lactate in the presence ofoxygen). Notably recent evidence indicates that PKM2 is highly expressed in the monocytes andmacrophages from patients with coronary artery disease and a driver of M1 macrophage polarization. Utilizingnovel mutant platelet-specific PKM2 deficient and myeloid-specific PKM2 deficient strains we have generatedpreliminary data that suggests a role for PKM2 in modulating thrombo-inflammation. The goals of this researchprogram are to further understand how PKM2 regulates platelet and leukocyte function and to determine iftargeting dimeric PKM2 will inhibit thrombo-inflammation in a murine model of hyperlipidemia. To promote thesuccess of this innovative and high reward program we will utilize complementary genetic andpharmacological approaches and state-of-the art intravital microscopy and follow updated Stroke TherapyAcademic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) pre-clinical guidelines. We have all the tools including reagents andstate-of-the art intravital microscopy and animal models to accomplish our goals. I have the prerequisiteexperience as evidenced by my track record which has shown high productivity and an upward trajectory inthe field of thrombo-inflammation. I have assembled a group of basic scientists and clinicians whose expertisewill help guide the proposed research from bench to clinic. This project has significant clinical implicationssince a clear understanding of energy metabolism and its functional consequences on platelet and leukocytefunction could identify novel therapeutic targets common to both thrombosis and inflammation which mayimprove outcomes in patients at high risk for thrombo-inflammatory disorders including acute ischemic stroke.","Acute;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antiplatelet Drugs;Aspirin;Biological Models;Blood Platelets;Cardiovascular Diseases;Clinical;Coronary Arteriosclerosis;Data;Disease;Economic Burden;Energy Metabolism;Enzymes;Exhibits;Genetic;Glucose;Glycoproteins;Goals;Guidelines;Hemorrhage;Hyperlipidemia;Industry;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Ischemic Stroke;Leukocytes;Malignant Neoplasms;Mus;Myelogenous;Normal Cell;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Oxygen;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Productivity;Pyruvate Kinase;Reagent;Research;Resolution;Rest;Risk;Role;Scientist;Stroke;Testing;Thrombosis;United States;Update;abciximab;acute coronary syndrome;aerobic glycolysis;bench to bedside;clinical efficacy;combat;dimer;experience;health economics;high reward;high risk;improved;improved outcome;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;intravital microscopy;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;prevent;programs;response;stroke model;stroke outcome;stroke therapy;success;therapeutic target;thromboinflammation;tool","Targeting Pyruvate Kinase M2: A novel strategy to combat thrombo-inflammation","Project NarrativeUtilizing platelet-specific and myeloid-specific PKM2 deficient mice as model systems the proposed studiesseek to validate a new mechanistic paradigm to understand how aerobic glycolysis regulates platelet andleukocyte function and whether targeting PKM2 a key regulator of aerobic glycolysis will inhibit thrombosisand inflammation.

"Biotechnology; Precision Medicine","Combining information from the vast body of protein sequences within the framework of protein structuresenables the deeper comprehension of the complex effects of amino acid substitutions. Compiling the sequencecorrelations within protein structural domains will lead to better distinguishing between neutral and deleteriouschanges. Protein structures provide the frameworks for understanding the sequence data through physicalproximity of directly interacting amino acids and in the manifestation of allostery. This will transform sequencematching from a 1-D process to a 3-D process. Due to the rapid advances in sequencing the largenumbers of available genomes now provide hundreds of millions of protein sequences and similar advances instructural biology now provide 100000+ protein structures. By combining these data our preliminary resultsshow that accounting for the pairwise correlations in the sequence for pairs closely interacting in the proteinstructures immediately yields enhanced ability to identify similar structures by means of sequence matching.Other preliminary data show that function identification by sequence matching is also improved. Such improvedhomolog identification can lead to progress in structure prediction. The overarching goal here is to apply adeep knowledge of protein structure together with the analyses of the available sequence data to theimportant problem of protein sequence matching. We take an entirely new highly innovative and uniquelymulti-faceted approach for this important problem. It is well established that physical factors such as aminoacid dense packing and other physical aspects of structures affect the conservation of amino acids and theseare accounted for in the new approaches taken here to sequence matching. The rationale is that proteinstructures provide the physical information and the framework for improving sequence matching toincorporate aspects of 3-D structure and allostery into sequence matching. Accounting for proteinflexibility and conformational dynamics will further broaden the investigated conformational space as well asprovide a better understanding of the correlations important for sequence evolution. Results from this projectwill improve the practice of molecular biology particularly the identification of functions of proteins having noassigned function and this is certain to have major impacts upon the understanding of evolution. This projectwill apply innovative new methods for extracting correlations in sequence structure and dynamics bydatamining of sequences and structures. The novel structure-based approaches will enable major advances insequence matching that will be implemented and disseminated on new web servers made available toanyone. The outcomes of the project will enable any scientist to discriminate significantly more effectivelybetween similar and dissimilar sequences. This better discrimination is essential for better function predictionfor the better understanding of evolution for better identification of non-functional protein mutants for improvedprotein design for medical diagnosis and for medical practice in the era of individual patient genomes.1","3-Dimensional;Accounting;Affect;Amino Acid Sequence;Amino Acid Substitution;Amino Acids;Behavior;Big Data;Complex;Comprehension;Coupled;Crude Extracts;Data;Data Set;Diagnosis;Discrimination;Distant;Elements;Evolution;Genes;Genome;Goals;Homologous Gene;Human;Individual;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Measures;Medical;Methods;Molecular Biology;Molecular Conformation;Mouse Protein;Mus;Mutation;Outcome;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Positioning Attribute;Process;Protein Engineering;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;Research Personnel;Scientist;Sequence Alignment;Structure;Viral;Virus;base;data mining;effective therapy;flexibility;improved;individual patient;individualized medicine;information framework;innovation;mutant;novel;novel strategies;pathogenic bacteria;phenome;pre-clinical;precision medicine;protein function;protein structure;protein structure prediction;structural biology;three dimensional structure;tool;web server","Protein Sequence Matching","Individualized medicine will rely on gene sequencing and knowledge in the era of patient genomes;understanding rapidly the differences among various mutant behaviors becomes a critical element for diagnosesand for developing individual therapies.

We have found increased striatal volume greater striatal neuron generation andchanges in striatal-dependent learning in mice exposed to prenatal maternal repetitive restraint stress. Prenataldisruptions including maternal stress are risk factors for negative developmental outcomes in children (e.g.ASD). There are gaps in knowledge about whether enlarged striatum is causative of ASD-related problemswith learning and what maternal placental and brain factors during prenatal development contribute toincreased striatal morphogenesis. We have preliminary data showing that prenatal stress increases levels ofmaternal interleukin-6 a proinflammatory cytokine implicated in ASD which independently increases striatalneuron generation. We also show that increased IGF signaling between placenta and embryonic brain isimplicated in our prenatal stress model and independently increases striatal neuron generation. We hypothesize that increased striatal morphogenesis plays a central role in prenatal risk for neurodevelopmental problems and that these changes are mediated by maternal interleukin-6 and IGF signaling. Our focus on striatal morphogenesis in embryonic brain is particularly novel and significant; we will examine multiple levels of its regulation and consequences when striatal growth is increased. We also will test the same mechanisms across multiple maternal stress modelsrestraint foot-shock and chronic variable stress--to generalize these stress findings beyond a single paradigm. First in Aim 1 we will assess the necessity and sufficiency of elevated maternal interleukin-6 for increased striatal neuron generation as a component of prenatal stress effects. We will also determine the importance of exposure timing a criticalquestion during rapid embryonic development. Second in Aim 2 we will assess the necessity and sufficiency ofincreased IGF signaling for prenatal stress effects on striatal progenitors. We will also assess growth factorchanges in maternal circulation and placenta across maternal stress models. Lastly in Aim 3 we will examinethe sufficiency of increased striatal neuron generation in vivo for changes in animal learning and striatalphysiology. We will use a novel strategy to increase striatal neuron generation in utero: intracerebroventricularinjection of a selective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist CHPG with specificity for increasing cellproliferation in striatal progenitors. In offspring with this exposure we will test striatal dependent types oflearningprocedural habit reversal and interval timing through operant training. We will also measure striatalneuronal ramping activity during learned interval timing.

Thus it is critical to provide basic mechanistic insights into thepossibility of universal influenza vaccines as carried out in animal models and much work is devoted tostrategies to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. However in the absence of neutralizing antibodies thepresence of IAV-specific memory CD8 T cells targeting conserved viral proteins such as NP or M2correlate with control of viral titers and reduction of disease symptoms in humans and mice. Mouse modelssuggest it is the lung resident memory CD8 T cells (Trm) that enable robust protection against IAV infection. Most animal models of influenza immunology rely on the sophisticated tools available for studies ofinbred mice. However our own data suggest that genetic diversity as manifested in humans and outbredmice can markedly affect T cell responses to influenza. Thus incorporating genetic diversity into mousemodels of influenza immunity may provide improved translational insights along with mechanisticinformation. However each outbred mouse is unique diminishing their utility. To address this we proposeto evaluate the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) mice as a potentially improved model ofinfluenza immunity. The CC mice exhibit near outbred but fully characterized genetic diversity howeverdue to the creative breeding approach each CC line is actually inbred and can be used for repeatedstudies outcrossing to other CC lines to further enhance genetic diversity and genetic mapping studies. Ourlong-term goal is to determine if the CC mouse model provides improved insights into the biology of IAV-induced Trm and how these cells can be manipulated to enhance immunity to aid in development ofuniversal influenza vaccines. We will address this long-term goal with the following specific aim:Specific Aim - Determine if genetic diversity in the CC mice will modulate IAV-specific circulating and lungresident memory CD8 T cell responses and thus result in an improved animal model of IAV immunity thatreflects the genetic diversity in outbred humans.","Address;Affect;Alleles;Animal Model;Antibodies;Biology;Breeding;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Chromosome Mapping;Clinical;Collaborations;Common Epitope;Comparative Study;Data;Development;Disease;Environment;Epitopes;Evaluation;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Exposure to;Genetic;Genetic Enhancement;Genetic Heterogeneity;Genetic Variation;Goals;Histocompatibility Antigens Class I;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunologics;Immunology;Inbred BALB C Mice;Inbred Mouse;Inbred Strain;Inbred Strains Mice;Inbreeding;Individual;Infection;Influenza;Influenza A virus;Influenza vaccination;Kinetics;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lung;Memory;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Mus;Outcome;Paper;Phenotype;Population;Productivity;Public Health;Publications;Publishing;Quantitative Trait Loci;Recording of previous events;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Study models;Symptoms;T cell differentiation;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Tissues;Transcend;Translations;Vaccination;Viral;Viral Proteins;Virus;Virus Diseases;Work;cohort;genetic manipulation;germ free condition;improved;in vivo;influenza infection;influenza virus vaccine;insight;interest;mouse model;neutralizing antibody;pathogen;response;seasonal influenza;tool;universal influenza vaccine","Evaluation of CC mice as an improved model for influenza immunity","Project NarrativeInfluenza infection is a major public health menace and our current strategies of seasonal influenzavaccination provide suboptimal protection.

"Biomedical Imaging; Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTImpaired mucociliary transport (MCT) is a common feature of multiple airway diseases including cystic fibrosis(CF). Effective MCT requires functional cilia and mucus. The mechanical properties of mucus influence MCT.In CF loss of bicarbonate transport in the airway epithelium decreases the pH of the airway surface liquid(ASL). The acidic ASL changes the electrostatic interactions of mucus making the mucus more viscous. Thisdefect is present at birth prior to the onset of infection and inflammation. Newborn CF pigs also have impairedMCT. We predict that the viscous mucus in newborn CF pigs gives rise to defective MCT.In the current application the candidate will probe the biophysical properties of freshly isolated porcine airwaymucus using agents that alter mucus electrostatic interactions. He will assess the biophysical properties usingpassive microrheology. Concomitantly he will measure MCT in newborn CF pigs using computed tomography(CT) and correlate how altered biophysical properties of mucus influence MCT.The candidate's long-term career goal is to become a leader in the fields of airway biology and airway disease.He plans to advance both fields by utilizing advanced imaging techniques and porcine models. The selectionof the porcine model is particularly relevant because the airway anatomy and physiology more closelyresemble humans than traditional rodent models.In the current K08 application the candidate will gain multiple intellectual professional and technical skills tofoster his development into an independent and successful physician scientist. He has an outstanding mentorand advisory committee that will guide him in learning passive microrheology of mucus and whole animal CT.This topic is highly significant as mucus biophysical properties influence MCT and thus the candidate's workcan shed light on basic biology and also potential therapeutics. In addition the candidate will continue todevelop his manuscript and grant writing abilities through reviewing of manuscripts and grants under Dr.Welsh's guidance. He will also take coursework in biomedical and biochemical engineering to advance hisunderstanding of the complex principles of rheology and imaging analyses.

"Estrogen; Neurosciences; Regenerative Medicine; Women's Health","Most spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) make afferent synapses on the auditory sensory cells the inner hair cells(IHCs) and convey auditory information to the brain. Noise damages cochlear afferent synapses even atsound levels too low to destroy hair cells. Noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy (NICS) is detectable byhistological examination and counting of synapses and is also evident noninvasively as reduced auditorybrainstem response (ABR) wave I amplitude. While synaptopathy does not detectably affect auditorythresholds it may cause hearing impairments such as poorer speech-in-noise performance or tinnitus. In thecourse of investigating means to prevent NICS we observed that female mice are significantly less susceptiblethan are males to NICS. Remarkably female susceptibility varies with estrous cycle phase with lowestsusceptibility correlated with the estrous phase at which progesterone (P4) levels are highest (and estrogenlowest). In vitro experiments additionally show that a high level of P4 promotes rapid regeneration of synapses.These data showing sex differences in synaptopathy are the first to show that susceptibility varies through theestrous cycle and to show a protective role for P4. To follow up our first aim is to determine whether a highlevel of steroid sex hormone does reduce NICS. To that end we will experimentally manipulate levels of P4and estrogen in male and female mice. We have further shown that not only P4 but also the neurotrophicfactor CNTF and agents that activate cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling promote synaptic regeneration. The latterinclude compounds such as rolipram that can be administered systemically. P4 CNTF and rolipramrepresent excellent reagents for investigating the role in vivo of cAMP in synapse regeneration and may alsobe candidate therapeutics for post-noise synapse regeneration therapy. However cochlear synapses may losetheir capacity for regeneration with time after damage and the timecourse may differ among the differentagents promoting regeneration. Our second aim will determine how long after noise these agents P4 CNTFor cAMP may be administered and still promote regeneration. Unlike the case for peptide neurotrophic factorsthe molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which progesterone or cAMP promote synapse regenerationremain obscure. Our third aim asks whether these factors function via genomic actions or via cytoplasmictargets or plasma membrane receptors  a necessary preliminary step for future detailed mechanistic studiesof signaling pathways and possible transcriptome changes involved. For cAMP the question is whether cAMP-dependent protein kinase enters the nucleus or remains a cytoplasmic signal a question we successfullyanswered previously with respect to survival signaling.

"Atherosclerosis; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Prevention","Project Summary / AbstractThe primary mechanism responsible for many acute vascular disorders including in-stent restenosis vein graftdisease and cardiac allograft arteriopathy is pathological vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) activation.VSMC activation leads to neointimal formation and re-occlusion of injured blood vessels. Strategies to preventabnormal VSMC remodeling such as cell growth inhibitors used in drug eluting stents have the undesiredeffect of impairing re-endothelialization. This attenuation of endothelial healing increases the risk ofneoatherosclerosis and late stent thrombosis. In order to prevent pathological VSMC growth but not re-endothelialization there is a critical need to identify cell-surface proteins that may can be targeted by agents todistinguish between VSMCs and endothelial cells (ECs) and modulate cellular processes utilized by VSMCsduring pathological remodeling that do not affect endothelium healing. The objective of this proposal is to utilizeVSMC-targeting aptamers that specifically modulate VSMC migration proliferation and apoptosis to define 1)define the cell-surface proteins and mechanism of action by which VSMC-targeting aptamers modulate VSMCbut not EC processes; and 2) determine the impact of these cell- and process-specific ligands on neointimalformation and re-endothelialization following acute vascular injury. We recently identified a VSMC-specific anti-migratory aptamer that prevents VSMC migration with no effect on EC migration. We determined that theVSMC anti-migratory aptamer operates by antagonizing PDGFR- activation but has no effect on PDGF-BB-mediated VSMC proliferation. These data suggest the novel concept that PDGFR- migration and proliferationsignaling may be dissociated. We have now identified two additional VSMC-targeting aptamers that modulateVSMC but not EC proliferation and apoptosis through unknown mechanisms originating at the cell surface.We will test the overall hypothesis that VSMC cell surface proteins and signaling pathways necessary formigration proliferation and apoptosis following acute vascular injury may be cell-specifically modulated toprevent neointimal formation without altering EC re-endothelialization. In Aim 1 we will define the mechanismby which VSMC PDGFR- dependent migration is dissociated from PDGFR- dependent proliferation and maybe inhibited to prevent neointimal formation without interfering with re-endothelialization. Aim 2 will identify thecell-surface protein using a novel application of a whole-genome CRISPR library and define the mechanismswhere VSMC proliferation may be specifically inhibited in VSMCs to prevent neointimal formation withoutimpacting re-endothelialization. Aim 3 will determine the mechanism and cell surface-proteins by which VSMCapoptosis may be induced to limit neointimal formation while preserving re-endothelialization. Completion ofthis study will result in a mechanistic understanding of modulating VSMC migration proliferation and apoptosistowards preventing neointimal formation and preserving re-endothelialization with applicability to a number ofacute vascular diseases.","Acute;Address;Agonist;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Arterial Disorder;Arterial Injury;Binding;Biological Assay;Blood Vessels;Blood flow;Bypass;CRISPR library;Cell Proliferation;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell physiology;Cell surface;Cells;Cessation of life;Data;Disease;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Event;Fluorescence;Goals;Growth Inhibitors;Impairment;In Vitro;Injury;Ligands;Mediating;Occlusion injury;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oranges;PDGFRB gene;Pathologic;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta Receptor;Procedures;Process;Proliferating;Reporting;Risk;Safety;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Specificity;Stents;Testing;Tissues;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Vein graft;Work;aptamer;attenuation;base;cell dedifferentiation;cell growth;cell motility;cell type;common treatment;drug efficacy;efficacious treatment;healing;heart allograft;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;innovation;migration;novel;platelet-derived growth factor BB;preservation;prevent;public health relevance;response;restenosis;stent thrombosis;targeted agent;targeted treatment;tool;vascular abnormality;vascular injury;vascular smooth muscle cell migration;vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation;whole genome","Deciphering mechanisms of vascular disease with cell and process specific ligands","Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance StatementCommon treatments for vascular disorders include revascularization procedures to restore blood flow (e.g.stenting bypass surgery) yet these procedures also damage healthy tissue within vessel leading to re-narrowing.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome; Muscular Dystrophy; Rare Diseases","Scientific AbstractMutations in the human LMNA gene encoding lamins cause skeletal muscular dystrophy thatexhibits a wide range of disease severity even among family members possessing the identicalmutation. This observation suggests the action of modifier genes. To identify candidate modifiergenes whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on members of a family with LMNAEmery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD2) (c.1580G>C; p.R527P). The analysis revealed anovel variant in the SMAD7 gene (c.932A.G; p.Q311R) that segregated with disease severity.SMAD7 encodes an inhibitor of the conserved TGF-/Smad signaling pathway. Activation of thispathway due to reduced levels of SMAD7 represses muscle growth and differentiation and causesloss of muscle tissue homeostasis. Using a Drosophila model of LMNA muscular dystrophy wefound that over-expression of the Drosophila orthologue of SMAD7 suppressed lethality causedby mutant lamins. To test the hypothesis that Smad signaling modifies muscle phenotypesinduced by mutant lamins we will 1) alter Smad signaling and assay for effects on musclephenotypes in Drosophila models of LMNA muscle disease and 2) perform WGS on anotherfamily with an LMNA mutation in which members exhibit either severe or asymptomatic muscledisease phenotypes. In addition we will analyze TGF-/Smad signaling in muscle biopsy tissuefrom individuals with LMNA muscular dystrophy. Collectively our experiments will determine theinterplay between TGF-/Smad signaling and lamins in skeletal muscle disease and identifycandidate modifier genes are potential targets for therapy. Our discoveries have the potential forbroad impact as individuals with LMNA muscle disease have symptoms of common diseasessuch as diabetes and metabolic syndrome.","Aging;Alleles;Antibodies;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Cessation of life;Critical Pathways;Cytology;DNA Sequence;DNA sequencing;Data;Daughter;Defect;Diabetes Mellitus;Differentiation and Growth;Disease;Drosophila genus;Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy;Exhibits;Family;Family member;Gene-Modified;Genes;Genomic DNA;Health;Homeostasis;Human;Individual;Intermediate Filaments;Laboratories;Lamins;Limb structure;MADH7 gene;Metabolic syndrome;Modeling;Morphology;Muscle;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Myopathy;Nuclear Envelope;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physicians;Pupa;Rare Diseases;Severities;Severity of illness;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Stains;Testing;Tissues;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Transgenes;Variant;age related;cell motility;common symptom;congenital muscular dystrophy;disease phenotype;disease-causing mutation;early onset;env Gene Products;experimental study;genome sequencing;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;loss of function;member;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;overexpression;skeletal;targeted treatment;therapy development;whole genome","Smad signaling in skeletal muscle laminopathies","Lay AbstractMutations in the human LMNA gene cause several types of rare muscular dystrophy includingEmery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

"Aging; Cancer; Hematology; Lymphatic Research; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","B lymphocytes are the cell of origin in the majority of hematologic malignancies and most human B cellcancers occur in individuals > 60 years of age. This age group also displays a greater propensity for varioustypes of immune dysfunction including both suboptimal immune responses as well as chronic inflammation.Understanding how chronic immune-activating signals in aging lymphocytes contribute to both compromisedimmunity and increased risk of immune-cell malignancies is critical to developing effective strategies forinterventions to increase `healthspan' of the growing population of humans of older ages. The proposed projectis based upon the recent observation that the signaling adapter protein TNF receptor associated factor 3(TRAF3) is reduced in protein amounts but not mRNA specifically in B (but not T) lymphocytes from older-aged normal humans and laboratory mice. TRAF3 serves as an important inhibitor of normal B cellhomeostatic survival as well as a B cell tumor suppressor so this finding has important biological implications.The long-term goal of the work of which this exploratory project forms a part is to understand how TRAF3regulates the function of B and T lymphocytes. The objective of this application is to determine howposttranslational mechanisms reduce TRAF3 protein in aging B but not T lymphocytes and identify whichmolecular pathways are crucial to this TRAF3 loss in B cells. The proposed experiments will address twomajor working hypotheses via two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the relationship between TRAF3protein levels with phenotypic and functional characteristics of B lymphocytes. The working hypothesis to betested in Aim 1 is that reduced TRAF3 protein will result in abnormal B cell survival and activation viadisruption of multiple TRAF3-regulated pathways. Aim 2 will define the age-relevant molecular mechanismsregulating TRAF3 protein levels in lymphocytes testing the working hypothesis that chronic inflammatory oractivation signals that increase with the aging process mediate post-translational modification and degradationof lymphocyte TRAF3 protein in both the cytoplasm and nucleus altering multiple signaling pathways. Aim 2will also address why TRAF3 is NOT degraded by TRAF3-associating receptors in T lymphocytes which mayprovide valuable information in designing strategies to prevent B cell aging-related TRAF3 loss. It is expectedthat completion of this exploratory project will determine how TRAF3 proteins levels are reduced in aginglymphocytes and how reduced TRAF3 impacts the biology and function of B cells. These findings can providevaluable information to guide interventions that both enhance the immune health of older individuals as well asinform therapeutic decisions in treating B cell cancers.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Age;Age-Years;Aging;American;Antibody Response;Apoptotic;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune Diseases;B lymphoid malignancy;B-Cell Development;B-Cell Lymphomas;B-Cell Neoplasm;B-Lymphocytes;Behavior;Biological;Biology;CREB1 gene;Cell Aging;Cell Nucleus;Cell Survival;Cell physiology;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Cytoplasm;Data;Event;Exhibits;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hour;Human;Human Herpesvirus 4;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunologic Receptors;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interleukin 6 Receptor;Intervention;Knowledge;LMP1;Laboratory mice;Lead;Leukocytes;Life;Lymphocyte;MCL1 gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Membrane Proteins;Messenger RNA;Mission;Molecular;Multiple Myeloma;Mus;Nature;Nuclear;Oncogenic;Organism;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Play;Polyubiquitination;Population;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc;Public Health;Receptor Signaling;Research;Research Project Grants;Retinoblastoma Protein;Risk;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;T-Lymphocyte;TNF receptor-associated factor 3;TNFRSF1A gene;TNFRSF5 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;age group;aged;base;cancer cell;design;evidence base;experimental study;glucose metabolism;healthspan;immune health;immunoregulation;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;loss of function mutation;lymphoid organ;normal aging;pathogen;prevent;protein degradation;receptor;receptor binding;recruit","Loss of TRAF3 in aging B lymphocytes","Project NarrativeThe proposed research project is relevant to public health because it investigates how a key protein thatregulates function of a particular type of immune system white blood cell is reduced in these cells in agingindividuals; loss of this protein may lead to abnormal cellular function pre-disposing to cancers of these whiteblood cells.

Sleepinterventions may be among treatments with such disease-modifying potential. Evidence from animal modelssuggests there is a bi-directional relationship between sleep and AD pathophysiology such that sleepdisruptions can facilitate amyloid beta (A) accumulation and its aggregation into plaques and downstreamformation of tau-tangles and conversely that AD pathophysiology can be reversed with sleep agents. Manykey findings from animal models translate to human models of the disease such as diurnal variation in A(higher in wakefulness lower in sleep) reduced clearance of A to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in sleepdeprivation and disruption and weakening of the A circadian rhythm with both normative aging and those withA plaques. Epidemiologic studies supplement these smaller sample findings to indicate sleep and circadiandisruptions can predict incident MCI/AD over 4-6 years. However other evidence suggests these predictionsare consistent with poor aging in general and may not be specific to AD. Experimental studies with efficacioussleep aids can address these questions. Melatonin improves sleep has a good safety record for long-term useamong older adults and improves cognitive outcomes over a 9-month period in non-randomized studiesamong MCI patients. However whether melatonin affects biomarkers in the A-cascade is unknown. Theproposed pragmatic trial will test efficacy of 5mg of melatonin on both memory and AD-biomarker outcomes inthe spectrum of preclinical to prodromal AD using stratified randomization of MCI+ and MCI- to active andplacebo arms using a short-term longitudinal framework. The participants will be observed with actigraphy toobjectively track both sleep and circadian rhythm in daily life for a two month period in the sleep-as-usualphase#1 ending with CSF sampling of AD biomarkers and brief cognitive testing. Following stratifiedrandomization participants will be followed for another two-month period with actigraphic monitoring in thesleep-intervention-phase#2 also ending with CSF sampling of AD biomarkers and brief cognitive testing.Phase#3 long-term follow-up will extend the melatonin treatment to 9 months without actigraphic monitoringending with CSF sampling of AD biomarkers and cognitive testing. Dense repeated objective sampling ofboth sleep and circadian function in the real-world and the coupling of those objective assessments with ADbiomarker sampling both prior to and after two-months of melatonin treatment will permit a methodologicallyrigorous evaluation of whether melatonin has disease-modifying treatment potential. Project's specific aimsare organized around the central prediction that improvements in episodic memory will lag those seen inbiomarkers and that biomarker improvements will mediate the effects of improved sleep on episodic memory.Findings will address whether previously reported associations of sleep / circadian function with AD outcomesspeak to the potential of these interventions to slow disease progression.","Abeta clearance;Address;Affect;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease patient;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Alzheimers disease biomarker;Amyloid beta-42;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animal Model;Biological Markers;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Circadian Dysregulation;Circadian Rhythms;Cognitive;Coupling;Disease;Disease Marker;Disease Outcome;Disease Progression;Disease model;Diurnal Rhythm;Elderly;Episodic memory;Evaluation;Functional disorder;Impairment;Individual;Intervention;Life;Longterm Follow-up;Measures;Mediating;Melatonin;Memory;Methodology;Monitor;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Outcome;Participant;Patients;Performance;Phase;Placebos;Randomized;Reporting;Research Design;Role;Safety;Sampling;Senile Plaques;Sleep;Sleep Deprivation;Sleep disturbances;Time;Translating;Wakefulness;abeta accumulation;actigraphy;arm;care burden;circadian;cognitive function;cognitive testing;cost;design;effectiveness testing;efficacy testing;epidemiology study;executive function;experimental study;human model;improved;indexing;mild cognitive impairment;mortality;pragmatic trial;pre-clinical;predictive modeling;processing speed;prodromal Alzheimer&apos;s disease;public health relevance;tau Proteins;tau-1","Evaluating the disease-modifying potential of a sleep intervention for Alzheimer's Disease outcomes","Public Health RelevanceAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating burden to patients and caretakers alike.

"Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Disparities; Health Services; Minority Health; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health","The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by theBoard of Regents to realize three objectives  first to lead the development of translational science at the UI;second to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third to disseminate capacitiesin translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affectingtranslational science that required institutional solutions such as transforming regulatory processes for humansubjects research developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and otherhealth care data establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations and revitalizing thepipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers.Iowa is a rural state which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these ruralconsiderations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams todevelop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches thatovercome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practicenetworks of family physicians clinics school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learningplatforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move researchBeyond Our Borders we have created methods to capture real-time real-life data from the home and tocorrelate this environmentally specific comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging withother CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop theevidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Thoughdistance and rurality drive our approaches the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially betterways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients healthcare teams andacademicians.

"Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome","The accurate and timely DNA replication program is a prerequisite of a stable genome. This proposedproject is built around our discovery that the RAD52 DNA repair protein performs an important andpreviously unknown function in supporting DNA replication. RAD52 protects replication forks fromexcessive degradation which depends on fork regression and on the MRE11 nuclease. Severalmechanisms including a well characterized mechanism ascribed to the activities of SMARCAL1 ZRANB3BRCA1 BRCA2 and RAD51 protect replication forks stalled by damage or endogenous roadblocks dueto the replication stress. Distinctly the function of RAD52 in fork protection is relevant not only afterinduction of fork stalling by exogenous stress but also during an unchallenged cell growth.Our goal here is to develop a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the RAD52 function at thereplication fork.The MRE11-dependent degradation of the replication forks depends on fork regression i.e. on theconversion of a three-way junction of stalled replication fork into a four-way junction called chicken foot.We propose that one or both of the following non-mutually exclusive mechanisms contribute(s) to RAD52function at the replication forks. In the first RAD52 may serve as a gatekeeper by preventing regressionof stalled but undamaged forks. In the second RAD52 may work as a protector of regressed forks eithertogether with or in parallel to the BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51 axis.In AIM 1 and AIM 2 we will use cell-based analyses stretched DNA fibers proximity-ligation assays andsingle-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (smTIRFM) to test the gatekeeper andthe protector mechanisms. By building a comprehensive mechanistic description of the RAD52-forkinteraction in the cell and in singulo we will discern whether one or both of these mechanisms are applicableto RAD52 and how RAD52 contributes to replication fork stability.In AIM 3 to characterize the consequences of the RAD52 deficiency we will combine the cell-basedassays stretched DNA fibers smTIRFM with the analysis of whole genome sequences by MMBIRFinderwhich is a new bioinformatics tool we developed to detect complex mutation events. We will determine themechanism(s) by which the aberrant recovery of DNA replication is funneled into different genomedestabilizing mechanisms in the presence and absence of RAD52.Upon successful completion of the proposed studies we will learn how RAD52 functions at distressedreplication forks how does it contribute to genome stability and how its deficiency leads to genomedestabilizing events during replication stress.","Antineoplastic Agents;BRCA1 gene;BRCA2 gene;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Cell Cycle Stage;Cell Death;Cells;Chickens;Complex;DNA;DNA Repair Gene;DNA biosynthesis;DNA replication fork;Dangerousness;Data;Development;Distress;Drug Targeting;Event;Failure;Fiber;Filament;Fluorescence Microscopy;Gatekeeping;Genetic;Genetic Materials;Genome;Genome Stability;Goals;Grant;Human;Lead;Learning;Ligation;Maps;Mediating;Modeling;Motor;Mutation;Neoplastic Cell Transformation;Nucleoproteins;Play;Proteins;RAD52 gene;Recovery;Role;Stress;Stretching;Testing;Time;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;bioinformatics tool;brca gene;cell growth;cell killing;foot;genome sequencing;mutant;nuclease;prevent;programs;repaired;replication stress;single molecule;whole genome","The role of human RAD52 protein in genome stability","Failure to timely and accurately replicate the genetic material may lead to genetic instability cell death orneoplastic transformation.

"Aging; Diabetes; Genetics; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention","Hydroxymethylated cytosine (5hmC) in DNA is an epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (OB) are diseases that are serious global public health challenges. Little isknown about the role of 5hmC in the development of T2D and OB. In our exploratory study to investigatehydroxymethylation using a co-twin control design we included three monozygotic twin pairs (MZ) discordantfor incident T2D (iT2D) and five separate MZ pairs discordant for prevalent OB from our previous R21(1R21HL127368-01) study of cardiovascular disease. Using circulating 5hmC as an aggregate surrogate forcumulative systemic hydroxymethylation intriguingly we found statistically significant whole-genomedifferentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) related to iT2D and prevalent OB respectively aftercontrolling for genetic variation in germline consisting of 3.2 billion base pairs age-period-cohort effects andmultiple-testing. Due to the very limited sample size and lack of twin pairs discordant for incident OB (iOB) inour prior exploratory study it is imperative to perform the prospective research in a relatively large sample togenerate strong evidence. The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Twin Study is a well-characterized 46-year follow-up study initiated in 1969. Leveraging existing rich resources in the NHLBI TwinStudy and our established multi-mechanism students' research engagement plan we propose this R15 study.Our overall objectives are to characterize circulating 5hmC in relation to iT2D and iOB and to offer an excellentopportunity for students to be engaged in public health epigenome research. These objectives will be achievedby pursuing three specific aims: 1) measure whole genome hydroxymethylation (5hmC) in blood DNA samples;2) test if DNA regions are differentially hydroxymethylated in relation to iT2D (aim 2-1) and iOB (aim 2-2)independent of germline and common environment; which in turn will identify novel differentiallyhydroxymethylated regions; and 3) characterize sociobehavioral and other environmental correlates ofhydroxymethylation in literature-based candidate and novel DNA regions independent of germline and commonenvironment. We will include all available twin pairs discordant for iT2D [17 MZ and 20 dizygotic twin pairs(DZ)] and separate twin pairs discordant for iOB (11 MZ pairs and 15 DZ pairs) from NHLBI Twin Study. TheNHLBI Twin Study twins were born between 1917 and 1927 a period when 2 male MZ pairs and 4 male DZpairs of twins were born per 1000 live births. An illustrative example is that inclusion of our dMZ twin samplesize is equivalent to that of at least 126746 singletons. The significance of our study is to provide innovativeevidence about iT2D and iOB-discriminating hydroxymethylation induced environmentally which could impactdisease prevention and treatment through the improvement of modifiable environmental factors. Our study willoffer a unique opportunity for engaging medical and graduate students at the applicant's institute in the publichealth epigenome research.","20 year old;Address;Age;Anthropometry;Base Pairing;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Process;Blood;Blood Glucose;Body mass index;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cessation of life;Clinical;Cohort Effect;Cytosine;DNA;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Disease;Dizygotic Twins;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;Follow-Up Studies;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Code;Genetic Transcription;Genetic Variation;Individual;Institutes;Interview;Life Style;Link;Literature;Live Birth;Logistic Regressions;Longevity;Measures;Medical Students;Methylation;Modification;Molecular;Monozygotic twins;Mutation;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Observational Study;Pathway interactions;Persons;Phase;Physical Examination;Prevention;Preventive;Public Health;Regimen;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Social Behavior;Students;Testing;Therapeutic;Training;Twin Multiple Birth;Twin Studies;Validation;base;bioinformatics tool;case control;cohort;cost efficient;design;differential expression;disorder prevention;epigenome;experience;fight against;follow-up;graduate student;innovation;insight;male;middle age;next generation;novel;prospective;whole genome","Hydroxymethylation Incident Type 2 Diabetes and Incident Obesity","The proposed discordant identical and fraternal twin study of incident type 2 diabetes and incident obesity ispivotal to public health because this study design compares diseased twins with their non-diseased co-twinsfor a better understanding of environment-induced hydroxymethylation independent of genetic influences asthe novel biological mechanism underlying the diseases.

Millions ofAmerican people use e-cigarettes. Our previous study found that 15.3% of contemporary US adultsever used e-cigarettes and 3.2% were current users of e-cigarettes. Despite their popularity publichealth effects of e-cigarettes use are uncertain. E-cigarettes may aid in smoking cessation in someindividuals but they can cause harm to others. E-cigarettes usually contain nicotine and other toxicsubstances such as heavy metals propylene glycol volatile organic chemicals and carcinogenicagents. Pregnancy represents a unique period of many physiologic challenges making it a time ofvulnerability to other stressors and thus a time of particular concern regarding potential effects of e-cigarettes. Our recent study showed that compared with non-pregnant women of reproductive agepregnant women had a lower rate of conventional cigarette smoking but almost identical rate of e-cigarette use. Evidence from animal studies has shown detrimental effects of e-cigarette use inpregnancy. However so far no human studies are currently available that directly assess the impact ofe-cigarette use on the health of pregnancy. As a recent Consensus Study Report from the NationalAcademies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine concluded there is no available evidence whetheror not e-cigarettes affect pregnancy outcomes. Clearly there is an urgent and critical need for humanstudies to assess health effects of e-cigarettes on the mother and the fetus. The objective of this projectis to determine the potential health effects of electronic cigarette use before and during pregnancy onpregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. We propose to conduct a large epidemiologicalstudy based on nationwide data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) in2016. We will include 33613 mothers who were aged 18 years or older and had a singleton delivery.The PRAMS participants reported whether and how often they used e-cigarettes during 3 monthsbefore pregnancy and in the last 3 months during pregnancy. The outcome variables include pregnancycomplications (i.e. gestational diabetes hypertensive disorders in pregnancy) and adverse birthoutcomes (e.g. low birth weight and preterm birth). Pregnancy complications are ascertained fromboth birth certificate and PRAMS questionnaire. Birth outcomes are ascertained from birth certificate.This large epidemiological study will for the first time address the effects of e-cigarette use onpregnancy and birth outcomes in humans. Successful completion of this project will provide importantdata for subsequent follow-up projects with R01 funding to fully understand the public healthconsequences of e-cigarettes during and beyond pregnancy. Eventually these findings will inform amore balanced future public health policy regarding e-cigarettes.","18 year old;Address;Adult;Affect;Age;American;Animals;Birth;Birth Certificates;Child;Consensus;Data;Disease;Electronic cigarette;Engineering;Exposure to;Fetal Development;Fetus;Funding;Future;Gestational Diabetes;Goals;Health;Health Policy;Heavy Metals;Human;Individual;Infant Health;Longevity;Low Birth Weight Infant;Maternal Health;Maternal and Child Health;Medicine;Monitor;Mothers;Nicotine;Outcome;Participant;Pediatrics;Physiological;Poison;Pregnancy;Pregnancy Complications;Pregnancy Outcome;Pregnant Women;Premature Birth;Propylene Glycols;Public Health;Questionnaires;Records;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Assessment;System;Time;United States National Academy of Sciences;Vulnerable Populations;adverse birth outcomes;base;carcinogenicity;cigarette smoking;combustible cigarette;cost effective;electronic cigarette use;electronic cigarette user;epidemiology study;follow-up;healthy pregnancy;high risk;improved;reproductive;smoking cessation;stressor;toxicant;volatile organic compound","Epidemiological Study of Electronic Cigarette Use and Adverse Pregnancy and Birth Outcomes","PROJECT NARRATIVEA healthy pregnancy affects short-term and long-term health in both mothers and their children.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics","Project SummaryThe molecular targets for vitreoretinopathy and uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood. Thisproposal builds on our exciting discovery of a calcium-activated protease calpain-5 (CAPN5) as the cause ofAutosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) and provides insight into structureand function of CAPN5. CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene and this discovery provides anunprecedented starting point for investigating the substantial gap in our understanding of the molecular basisof ocular inflammation. Until recently the CAPN5 structure had been undetermined hindering the investigationof its mechanism of action. Since our last submission we solved the 3.0  crystal structure of the wild-typeCAPN5 protease core. Structural studies of CAPN5 ADNIV disease mutants will inform how these mutationsalter CAPN5 structure and function. Our long-term goal is to identify new therapeutic targets for uveitis. Ourobjective is to use x-ray crystallography and other biochemical techniques to study the structural mechanismsof CAPN5 activation. Our central hypothesis is that ADNIV mutants cause the CAPN5 protease core to adopt aclosed conformation stabilizing the active site and relieving the enzyme from calcium dependence. This overactiveCAPN5 then aberrantly cleaves proteolytic targets contributing to the ADNIV disease phenotype. Insight gainedfrom this study may eventually be used to design therapies for ADNIV and other calpain-associated pathologies.My studies will test the hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Identify natural CAPN5 peptide substratesand determine their specificity (2) Use x-ray crystallography to define the structure of CAPN5 mutants and (3)Determine the function of extensible loops in CAPN5 activity. Impact. We expect to gain not only a betterunderstanding of calpain activity in eye disease but also to identify new lead compounds to design inhibitorsagainst CAPN5.","Active Sites;Adopted;Affect;Age;Behavior;Binding;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Blindness;Calcium;Calpain;Cell Nucleus;Cleaved cell;Complex;Crystallization;Data;Dependence;Disease;Enzymes;Eye diseases;Family Study;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer;Genes;Goals;Home;Hyperactivity;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inherited;Investigation;Lead;Length;Location;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Target;Mutation;Mutation Analysis;Pathology;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptides;Phospholipids;Photoreceptors;Proteins;Publishing;Regulation;Roentgen Rays;Role;Site;Specificity;Structural Models;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Uveitis;Work;X-Ray Crystallography;design;disease phenotype;experimental study;gain of function mutation;gene discovery;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mutant;neovascular;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;therapy design","Structure-function studies of Calpain-5 in hereditary uveitis","Project NarrativeADNIV is an inherited eye disease caused by gain of function mutations in calpain-5 that cause vitreoretinaldegeneration and uveitis.

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI); Traumatic Head and Spine Injury","AbstractThe goals of the proposed mentored award are two-fold: 1) to provide protected time for intensive mentoredresearch to develop Dr. Newell into an independent physician-scientist with a focus on the immune response totraumatic brain injury (TBI) and 2) to identify cell-type specific mechanisms that drive IL-1RI inducedinflammation and neurotoxicity following TBI. In the United States 1.7 million adults & 600000 children sufferfrom TBI each year. Unfortunately pharmacologic therapies for TBI are non-existant. Treatment strategies thattarget specific secondary injury cascades that follow TBI are critically needed. Inflammation driven by IL-1 andother pro-inflammatory cytokines is one potential secondary injury pathway. Using a fluid percussion injurymodel of TBI in mice a mixed focal and diffuse injury is created with an accompanying inflammatory reactionsimilar to what occurs in human TBI. We have recently shown genetic blockade of IL-1RI signaling resulted indecreased neuroinflammation and improved cognitive function post-TBI. The hypothesis of this proposal is thatastrocyte-specific IL-1RI signaling results in direct neurotoxicity as well as in microglial and leukocyteactivation. The proposed studies will identify astrocyte-specific contributions of IL-1 induced secondary injurypost-TBI. In the first aim we will examine the impact of IL-1RI signlaling on astrocyte phenotype and theimpact of IL-1 activated astrocytes on neurodegeneration. In the second aim we will examine the impact ofastrocyte IL-1RI signaling on microglial activation and brain leukocyte recruitment following TBI. At the sametime the proposed project is designed to provide critical career development training to the candidate. Theproposal builds upon the candidate's established interest in TBI and her prior training in TBI modeling andneuroimmunology. The candidate will be mentored by senior faculty members with extensive experience inneuroscience neuroimmunology and pre-clinical TBI research.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Health Disparities; Minority Health; Social Determinants of Health","AbstractThe Iowa Biosciences Academy (IBA) operates under the aegis of The University of Iowa (UI) Initiative forMaximizing Student Development (IMSD) grant. Its mission is to identify and competitively train academicallytalented underrepresented (UR) minority disadvantaged and/or disabled undergraduate students who haveaspirations for research careers in the biomedical behavioral and clinical sciences. The IBA program directlycontributes to NIH's effort of increasing the diversity of the biomedical workforce ensuring NIH remains aleader in scientific innovation and discovery. To meet this effort the overall goals of this proposal are toexpand access to the successful undergraduate initiatives currently in place in the IBA to the large communityof first-generation and rural students at UI. This expansion provides additional opportunities to test innovativementor/mentee training interventions developed through the NIH-funded National Research MentoringNetwork. We propose to increase the institutional impact of IBA by creating a network of campus scientistsinterested in increasing UR participation and retention in STEM-related majors and research. To implement theproposed expansion of the IBA we have identified faculty and staff with expertise in several key areas. Theseinclude: undergraduate student development science communication quantitative fluency T32-based doctoraltraining career development responsible conduct in research mentor training and program evaluation.Specific strategies for student development outlined in the proposal include: a mentored research trainingexperience competency-based mentor and mentee training and access to career counseling. The IBAcontinues to embed itself within the institution working with departments units and centers across six collegeson campus to increase science cultural capital of UR and disadvantaged students on campus.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/AbstractSepsis is a life-threatening condition that has doubled in incidence over the past decade and now constitutes17% of all in-hospital deaths in the US at an annual cost of $24 billion. Early aggressive emergency caresaves lives yet many rural hospitals have low adherence to evidence-based sepsis care guidelines.Consequently rural sepsis patients have a 38% higher mortality rate. Rural emergency department (ED)-basedtelemedicine has been proposed to standardize care and support local clinicians in rural hospitals but itseffectiveness has never been rigorously tested. With 19% of the US population living in rural areas and anestimated 5000 preventable rural sepsis deaths annually in the US there is a critical need to test strategies toimprove dissemination and implementation of evidence-based sepsis guidelines in rural centers. The goal ofthis Career Development Award is to prepare the applicant for a career as a clinical investigator and healthservices researcher focusing on comparative effectiveness research of rural acute care interventions. This goalwill be accomplished within the infrastructure of the Rural Telehealth Research Center through (a) specificgraduate coursework (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee (c) carefully selected conferences andworkshops and (d) a mentored research study. The specific aims of the proposed study are (1) to measure theassociation between ED-based telemedicine use guideline adherence and clinical outcomes (2) to measurethe effect of a telemedicine relationship on guideline adherence among patients who have telemedicineavailable but not used and (3) to describe how and why telemedicine use affects clinical care decision-making and dissemination of best practices using qualitative methods. The proposed mentored researchproject will accomplish these aims through an observational cohort study of patients with severe sepsis orseptic shock treated in critical access hospitals in a large Midwestern telemedicine network over a 4-yearperiod. Our central hypothesis is that telemedicine will improve clinical outcomes through improved adherencewith international sepsis guidelines by changing (1) patient-level recommendations (2) provider-level behaviorand (3) hospital-level practices. At the end of this Career Development Award the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent scientist with expertise in rural acute sepsis care with specific strength incomparative effectiveness research methods and qualitative methods. Our study findings will serve as thebasis for future studies to understand the role of dissemination strategies (including telemedicine) onimplementing best practices in rural health care settings which will form the foundation of the candidate's firstR01 submission."," ","Evaluating the Role of Telemedicine in Improving Rural Emergency Department Sepsis Care","Project Narrative:Severe sepsis is a leading cause of death in the US and increased mortality in rural hospitals leads to nearly5000 preventable rural sepsis deaths in the US each year.

"Bioengineering; Physical Injury - Accidents and Adverse Effects; Prevention; Wound Healing and Care","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTPost-traumatic elbow contracture is a debilitating complication characterized by joint immobility and caused bythickening and stiffening of the joint capsule. Surgical capsular release is performed when contractures do notrespond to nonsurgical intervention. Capsular release however generally only improves (but not normalize)elbow range of motion. Furthermore additional fibrosis and contraction often recurs all of which necessitatesthe need to develop better treatment strategies. Joint capsules from post-traumatic elbow contractures havebeen found to contain activated myofibroblasts expressing alpha smooth muscle actin (-SMA) and increasedcollagen deposition. In other wound healing scenarios myofibroblasts exert contractile forces on the ECM andsynthesize collagen in a manner that is modulated in part by mechanical forces and biochemical factors presentin and around the wound. These components interact with the myofibroblasts in a reciprocal and dynamicmanner such that wound healing proceeds as a mechano-chemical feedback loop that resolves with eithernormal or pathological healing. We hypothesize that this feedback loop is also operational in the injured jointcapsule and contributes to capsule thickening and contracture. Our strategy is to interrupt this feedback loop bytemporarily blocking NMMII-actin engagement and thus the ability of myofibroblasts to generate and sense forceat critical points during wound healing by delivering the drug blebbistatin (or its derivatives) to the wound site viapoly(lactide-co-gylcolide) (PLGA) particles. This project has two major aims that are centered on developing amechanistic understanding of the feedback loop in the joint capsule and assessing the feasibility of using smallmolecules to interrupt this feedback loop and reduce/eliminate fibrosis and contracture. In aim 1 we will performa series of in vitro experiments where we compare blebbistatin and para-nitroblebbistatin PLGA particlecompositions and release kinetics to remodeling outcomes such as myofibroblast activation force generationmyofibroblast activation collagen production and ECM remodeling/tissue stiffness. In aim 2 we will test theability of blebbistatin or para-nitroblebbistatin to mitigate joint capsule thickening/stiffening contracture andfibrosis in a validated rat model of elbow joint contracture. We envision that inhibition of NMMII activity withblebbistatin/para-blebbistatin can be used adjunctively to capsule release surgery. We hypothesize that thecontrolled-release of drug will temper myofibroblast behavior so that more normal healing follows and largergains in post-operative ROM are maintained. The knowledge gained here will also have implications for otherjoints (e.g. knee ankle finger) and fibrotic conditions.","Actins;Actomyosin;Adherens Junction;Adopted;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Ankle;Articular Range of Motion;Behavior;Biochemical;Bioreactors;Bone Tissue;Cell Membrane Permeability;Cellularity;Chemicals;Clinical;Collagen;Complex;Complication;Contracts;Contracture;Cues;Cytoskeleton;Data;Deposition;Dose;Elbow;Elbow Injury;Elbow joint structure;Extracellular Matrix;Feedback;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Fingers;Generations;Human;In Vitro;Injectable;Injections;Injury;Intercellular Junctions;Interruption;Intervention;Joint Capsule;Joints;Kinetics;Knee;Knowledge;Length;Mechanics;Microfilaments;Minor;Modeling;Myofibroblast;Myosin Type II;Normal Range;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outcome Study;Pathologic;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physical therapy;Postoperative Period;Prevention;Preventive measure;Process;Production;Rattus;Recurrence;Risk;Safety;Series;Site;Smooth Muscle Actin Staining Method;Soft Tissue Injuries;Splint Device;System;Testing;Tissues;Trauma;Treatment Effectiveness;Wound models;base;blebbistatin;capsule;controlled release;cost;efficacy testing;experimental study;healing;improved;in vitro Model;inhibitor/antagonist;joint injury;joint mobilization;joint stiffness;mechanical force;non-muscle myosin;particle;poly(lactide);prevent;response;small molecule;small molecule inhibitor;treatment effect;treatment strategy;wound;wound healing","Preventing Recurrent Capsular Contracture in Traumatic Elbow Injuries","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis project seeks to demonstrate that the controlled release of blebbistatin (or its derivatives) in a healing elbowjoint capsule via biodegrading PLGA particles can be optimized to limit excessive collagen production andcontracture by myofibroblasts so that joint mobility is sustained without the recurrence of fibrosis.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases","AbstractCryptococcal meningoencephalitis (CME) is one of the most important opportunistic infections affecting peoplewith HIV/AIDS. The importance of this disease is due not only to its high incidence and mortality in this andother patient populations but also to the fact that symptoms of CME are a common sentinel event leading tothe diagnosis of HIV/AIDS. Thus many patients must first survive CME before they can benefit from theadvances in HIV therapy. Unfortunately the outcomes for CME therapy are far from acceptable particularly inresource-limited regions with high burdens of disease. Consequently effective and widely available therapiesfor CME are an unmet clinical need of global importance. Cryptococcus spp. are basidiomycetous yeastswhose primary niche is the external environment. As such only strains and species of Cryptococcus that cantransition to and replicate within the human host are able to cause disease. Our central premise is that anunderstanding of the biological mechanisms required for Cryptococcus to survive in human beings couldprovide new targets for therapy in the same way as studying tumor biology informs the design of new anti-cancer drugs. An important environmental distinction between the human host and the natural niche ofCryptococcus is the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2). We hypothesized that adaptation to host levels ofCO2 may represent a critical step in Cryptococcus pathogenesis. To specifically test this hypothesis wecompared the growth of C. neoformans var. grubii strains under conditions that varied only in the concentrationof CO2. Consistent with our hypothesis the growth rate was reduced at concentrations of CO2 experienced inthe host. Next we tested the CO2 tolerance of a set of environmental strains with known virulence propertiesin a mouse model; strains with reduced growth in the presence of host concentrations of CO2 were avirulentwhile those with growth rates that matched clinical isolates from human patients were virulent. We thereforehave discovered that CO2 tolerance is a previously unrecognized host environment-associatedvirulence attribute of C. neoformans. Accordingly the goal of this proposal is to identify the genetictranscriptional and regulatory responses that allow specific strains of C. neoformans to respond to hostconcentrations of CO2 and thereby cause CME. To accomplish these goals we propose the followingspecific aims: Aim 1. Characterize the virulence transcriptional and genomic distinctions between CO2-tolerant and -non-tolerant C. neoformans strains; Aim 2. Identify genes required for CO2 tolerance throughtargeted and large-scale genetic screening; and Aim 3. Determine the molecular mechanisms of genesrequired for C. neoformans CO2 response. Successful execution of these aims will not only further ourunderstanding C. neoformans pathogenesis and host survival but also identify new molecular targets for futureexploration as drug targets.","AIDS/HIV problem;Affect;Air;Anabolism;Antineoplastic Agents;Biological;Carbon;Carbon Dioxide;Cessation of life;Clinical;Cryptococcal Meningitis;Cryptococcus;Cryptococcus neoformans;Data;Disease;Drug Targeting;Environment;Event;Evolution;Future;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Genomic approach;Genomics;Genotype;Glycolysis;Goals;Growth;HIV antiretroviral;HIV diagnosis;HIV therapy;High temperature of physical object;Homeostasis;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;Infection;Lung;Meningoencephalitis;Metabolism;Minority;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Mus;Mutation;Opportunistic Infections;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Phenotype;Positioning Attribute;Property;Publishing;Quantitative Trait Loci;Resources;Role;Sentinel;Sphingolipids;Symptoms;Testing;Tumor Biology;Variant;Virulence;Virulent;Yeasts;antiretroviral therapy;base;burden of illness;capsule;deletion library;design;differential expression;experience;experimental study;fitness;genetic resource;genome wide association study;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;mortality;mouse model;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutics;pathogenic fungus;patient population;response;trait;transmission process","Genetic and mechanistic analysis of carbon dioxide tolerance in Cryptococcus pathogenesis","PROJECT NARRATIVECryptococcal meningitis is one of the most important opportunistic infections affecting people living withHIV/AIDS causes over 500000 deaths annually.

"Aging","Hydrogen sulfide is a key gasotransmitter in human cells and the addition of exogenous hydrogen sulfide atsingle micromolar or lower concentrations is actively being explored for clinical applications. Three drugsbased on the release of hydrogen sulfide are in phase I or II clinical trials. Although the location of whereexogenous hydrogen sulfide partitions inside of cells can be tracked using several two-step tagging methodstracking the location of exogenous hydrogen sulfide in tissue or animal models cannot be done. This limits thedevelopment of therapies based on the slow release of hydrogen sulfide because it cannot be tracked once itis administered to an animal or tissue. The long-term goal is to investigate the mechanisms of how exogenoushydrogen sulfide is transported and accumulates in the body. The overall objective of this application is tosynthesize chemicals widely used to add exogenous hydrogen sulfide so these chemicals release radioactive35S labelled hydrogen sulfide which will allow it to be tracked on a tissue and animal level for the first time. Thecentral hypothesis is that 35S labeled sulfate can be converted into several key chemicals that releasehydrogen sulfide in response to different stimuli and that the concentration and amount of 35S labelledhydrogen sulfide can be rationally controlled. This proposal builds on prior work by others that used 35Slabelled methionine cysteine and other chemicals to investigate where they partitioned in animal and tissuemodels using scintillation and light microscopy autoradiography. Despite the success of the use of these 35Slabelled chemicals no one has described the synthesis of chemicals that slowly release 35S labelled hydrogensulfide despite its importance in medicine. The rationale for completing this work is that it will allow scientists totrack where exogenous hydrogen sulfide partitions in tissue and animal models for the first time to thoroughlyinvestigate the origins of the effect of exogenous hydrogen sulfide in treating diseases in animal models. Thecentral hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify the reactions to synthesize GYY-4137 dialkyldithiophosphates caged perthiols and DTT to release 35S labelled hydrogen sulfide at controlledrates and doses; and 2) Identify the reactions to synthesize diallyl trisulfide and trisulfides of cysteine andglutathione that will release 35S labelled hydrogen sulfide in the presence of thiols. The research proposed inthis application is innovative in the applicant's opinion because it challenges the status quo of tracking thelocation of exogenous hydrogen sulfide by the synthesis of chemicals that will allow it to be tracked on thetissue and animal levels for the first time. This proposal combines scintillation and light microscopyautoradiography that were used to image 35S labelled amino acids with the first synthesis of chemicals toslowly release 35S labelled hydrogen sulfide to solve a key problem in biology. The proposed research issignificant because it will advance research already underway to understand the effects of exogenous H2S andto more rapidly develop clinical applications of these chemicals.","Adhesions;Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amino Acids;Animal Disease Models;Animal Model;Animals;Arthritis;Autoradiography;Biology;Cell membrane;Cells;Chemicals;Cysteine;Degenerative polyarthritis;Development;Disease;Dose;Enzymes;Fluorescence Spectroscopy;Glaucoma;Glutathione;Goals;Half-Life;Heart failure;Human;Hydrogen Sulfide;Hypertension;Image;Individual;Integral Membrane Protein;Investigation;Isotope Labeling;Label;Leukocytes;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Medicine;Methionine;Methods;Myocardial Infarction;Neuroglia;Neurons;Organ;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phase I Clinical Trials;Phase II Clinical Trials;Proteins;Public Health;Radioactive;Reaction;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reagent;Research;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Scientist;Sepsis;Signal Pathway;Stimulus;Structure;Sulfate;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Testing;Time;Tissue Model;Tissues;Work;animal tissue;base;biological adaptation to stress;cell type;chemical release;chemical synthesis;clinical application;clinical development;diallyl trisulfide;endoplasmic reticulum stress;in vivo;innovation;light microscopy;mouse model;neuron loss;novel therapeutics;persulfides;phase II trial;radiotracer;response;success;therapy development","Slow release of isotopically labelled hydrogen sulfide to track its location in animals and tissues","Project NarrativeThe proposed research is relevant to public health because it will result in the development of anew method to use a radiotracer to track the location of exogenous hydrogen sulfide in tissuesand animals for the first time.

PROJECT SUMMARYSix million Americans are in need of palliative care (PC) every year. A very large proportion of these persons sufferxerostomia oral pain or infection soft tissue pathology and other oral health issues. Poor oral health limits food choicesinterferes with social interactions and compromises quality of life (QoL). It can also affect one's abilities to toleratechemotherapy or radiotherapy accelerate cognitive decline and cause life-threatening septicemia aspiration pneumoniadeep neck space infection and even death causing preventable suffering for persons receiving palliative care (PRPC) andtheir family caregivers (FCG).Oral health is substantially undervalued under the current practice model. Oral health has not yet been addressed in thenational PC practice guideline. Physicians often overlook oral health and thus it seems to be less importance to them.Discouraged by this false impression PRPC and FCG also often undervalue oral health. As a result the oral health needsof PRPC seldom receive appropriate assessment and treatment leading to greater comorbidity and suffering. Meanwhiledentists often lack training in end-of-life dental care resulting in terminally-ill nursing home residents including those inthe last 3 months of life receiving extensive dental surgery and other aggressive treatment. These evidence clearlydemonstrates that the current practice model fails to appropriately address the oral health needs of PRPC. A new clinicalparadigm is urgently needed to address this crisis.In response the proposed study aims to develop an oral health intervention to improve oral health awareness and increasedental referrals for PRPC attending the University of Iowa Palliative Care (UIPC) clinic. This study consists of twophases. In Phase I oral examinations and symptom reviews will be conducted with approximate 32 PRPC to identify theiroral health conditions after which qualitative structured interviews will be completed with the PRPC and their FCG toreview their oral health findings and attempt to understand the dyad's perceived needs treatment goals and carepreferences corresponding to each of the documented conditions. Based on this information and the inputs of a PC expertpanel we will develop and refine the proposed intervention in Phase II which is expected to include a training module forthe PC team an oral symptom review form a personalizable training module for dyads and a dental referral guide for PCproviders. The UIPC medical team 20 newly-recruited PRPC/FCG dyads and a supportive care nurse (the PRPC/FCGtrainer) will then be recruited to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the proposed intervention into daily PC practice.The feasibility test will focus on five domains: acceptability demand implementation practicality and integration.Successful completion of this study will provide foundational data to develop the first interdisciplinary collaborative PCpractice in the nation that includes dentistry. Building on this innovative model and study results our next step will be toexamine how this intervention as a formal component of daily PC practice can improve oral health and QoL for PRPCproviding essential evidence toward the development of a new clinical paradigm to improve the quality of care for PRPC.","Address;Adult;Affect;American;Aspiration Pneumonia;Awareness;Care given by nurses;Caring;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical;Confusion;Consensus;Data;Dental;Dental Care;Dental Research;Dentistry;Dentists;Dentures;Development;Diagnosis;Education;Family;Family Caregiver;Feasibility Studies;Focus Groups;Food;Foundations;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health Care Costs;Health education;Healthcare;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Individual;Infection;Intake;Intervention;Interview;Iowa;Lead;Life;Life Expectancy;Light;Medical Care Team;Medicine;Modeling;Mouth Diseases;Mycoses;Neck;Needs Assessment;Nursing Homes;Nutritional;Oral;Oral Examination;Oral health;Pain;Palliative Care;Participant;Pathology;Patient Care;Patients;Perception;Persons;Phase;Physicians;Pneumonia;Practice Guidelines;Process;Protocols documentation;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Radiation therapy;Reporting;Research;Sample Size;Savings;Septicemia;Series;Social Interaction;Structure;Supportive care;Symptoms;Terminal Disease;Terminally Ill;Training;Training Activity;Universities;Work;Xerostomia;aggressive therapy;base;care preference;care providers;chemotherapy;comorbidity;dental surgery;end of life;end of life care;feasibility testing;functional decline;hospice environment;impression;improved;innovation;mortality;neglect;oral care;oral infection;oral pain;palliative;prevent;recruit;response;satisfaction;soft tissue;success;theories","Improving oral health awareness and dental referrals for adult patients receiving palliative care","8.

"Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Neurosciences; Stroke; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTSmall unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) (37 mm in diameter) have an average annual likelihood ofgrowth (1 mm) of 3% per year (range: 721% over 24 years of follow-up).1-11 Intracranial aneurysms (IA) thatenlarge have 1224 times increased risk of rupture compared to those that do not.1-11 These data compelledthe AHA/ASA in their 2015 guidelines to strongly recommend surgical or endovascular treatment of UIAs thatenlarge12 but the need for these expensive invasive procedures which have associated morbidity andmortality could be limited if pharmaceutical treatments could be developed to prevent IA growth or rupture.Based on data from a series of studies in humans and animals regarding UIAs Aspirin has shown tosafe inexpensive and effective treatment to decrease IA growth and rupture.But do women and men respond equally to ASA? The answer is NO. (A) Our animal study revealed thatthere are sex-specific differences in the biologic response to ASA and the ability of ASA to reduce the risk of IArupture in mice.15 (B) We identified effects on expression of 15-PGDH as a potential cause of this phenomenonand reversed these effects by activating this enzyme in female mice and inhibiting it in male mice.15 (C) Thefinding of sex-specific responses to ASA in mice was confirmed in humans using data from ISUIA cohort withASA being 20% more effective in reducing IA rupture in males than females.15 (D) Serum analysis of bloodcollected from within human IA sacs showed significant elevation of 15-PGDH in males when compared tofemales confirming our findings in mice and adding more evidence of sex differential response to ASA and 15-PGDH as potential explanation for this response.23Our proposal seeks to test these primary hypotheses: (1) activation of 15-PGDH decreases the risk of IArupture by: a) decreasing the harmful expression of PGE2 and b) converting PGE2 to 15-keto PGE2 which actsas an endogenous agonist of PPAR which is known to decrease the risk of IA rupture; (2) the effect of 15-keto PGE2 is cell-specific to smooth muscle cells and macrophages.To test these hypotheses we will perform these two specific aims:Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that activation of 15-PGDH decreases risk of UIA rupture equally in maleand female WT mice by (A) decreasing expression of PGE2 and (B) increasing 15-keto PGE2 which acts as anendogenous agonist of PPAR which we showed decreases the risk of IA rupture. Specific Aim 2: Test thehypothesis that the effect of 15-keto PGE2 (final byproduct of 15-PGDH which functionally acts as anendogenous PPAR activator) primarily acts in smooth muscle cells (SMC) and macrophages (M).","Agonist;Aneurysm;Animal Model;Animals;Antiinflammatory Effect;Antioxidants;Aspirin;Attenuated;Biological;Blood;Caliber;Cells;Cerebral Aneurysm;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Data;Dinoprostone;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Double-Blind Method;Endothelium;Enzymes;Female;Gene Expression;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Growth;Guidelines;Health;Human;Incidence;Inflammatory;Intracranial Aneurysm;Mediating;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mutation;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Observational Study;Operative Surgical Procedures;PTGS2 gene;Pathway interactions;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;Placebos;Play;Procedures;Process;Randomized;Recommendation;Research;Risk;Role;Rupture;Ruptured Aneurysm;Series;Serum;Sex Differences;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stroke;Testing;Time;Translations;Woman;base;cellular targeting;cohort;cost;effective therapy;follow-up;improved;innovation;macrophage;male;men;mortality;mouse model;novel;pre-clinical;preclinical study;prevent;prospective;protective effect;response;sex;therapeutic target","15-PGDH as a better therapeutic target than aspirin in decreasing risk of intracranial aneurysm rupture in men and women equally","PROJECT NARRATIVESeveral human observatory studies and pre clinical date from animal model of cerebral aneurysms stronglysuggests that aspirin attenuates the inflammatory process within the wall of these aneurysms resulting indecreased aneurysm rupture; however aspirin has sex differential response.

"Clinical Research; Kidney Disease","Project Summary/Abstract C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is an aggressive form of glomerular disease that occurs at any age and carriesthe highest risk for irreversible renal failure of the known glomerular diseases. Recurrence post-renaltransplant remains a major medical issue for the most patients. This dismal outlook reflects an incompleteunderstanding of the underlying pathophysiology of C3G a knowledge gap that has not only led to our inabilityto explain the limited success of currently available anti-complement agents but has also hindered thedevelopment of new therapies for C3G. Familial cases support the hypothesis that C3G results from primary complement dysregulation howeverour understanding of the genetics of C3G is incomplete. An adequate accounting for the role ofautoantibodies in C3G is also lacking. Finally in the majority of patients C3G follows a chronic indolentcourse. Activation of the alternative complement pathway can be documented with kidney biopsies confirmingthe deposition of complement proteins and their cleavage products in the renal glomerulus. However theassociation between complement activity and clinical outcome is poorly understood a reflection of theabsence of longitudinal studies of C3G focused on genetics autoantibodies and complement activity inrelationship to long-term renal outcome. In this grant we propose to:  Specific Aim 1. Define genetic drivers of C3G  Specific Aim 2. Identify and characterize autoantibodies to complement proteins and convertases  Specific Aim 3. Develop and validate clinically useful predictive models of disease progression in a longitudinal data-driven analysis of complement factors in C3G Completing these aims will meet our short-term goals which are to provide a better understanding of C3Gand to improve care for C3G patients and provide a foundation for our long-term goal which is to identify aneffective treatment for this disease.","Accounting;Address;Age;Alternative Complement Pathway;Autoantibodies;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Caring;Chronic;Clinical;Complement;Data;Deposition;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Foundations;Functional disorder;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Grant;Indolent;Kidney;Kidney Failure;Kidney Glomerulus;Kidney Transplantation;Knowledge;Longitudinal Studies;Medical;Outcome;Patients;Proteins;Proteolysis;Publishing;Recurrence;Renal glomerular disease;Role;Specificity;Testing;Variant;Work;base;design;effective therapy;gene complementation;high risk;improved;kidney biopsy;novel;novel therapeutics;patient population;predict clinical outcome;predictive modeling;success","C3 Glomerulopathy -- A Collaborative Study","Project Narrative The over-arching goals of this study focused on C3 glomerulopathy are to define geneticdrivers of disease to identify and characterize autoantibodies to complement proteins andconvertases and to develop and validate clinically useful predictive models of diseaseprogression in a longitudinal data-driven analysis of complement factors in C3G.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","PRJOECT ABSTRACTMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervoussystem (CNS) whereby infiltrating autoreactive clones with additional pro-inflammatory cell typesthey recruit and support work to destroy the protective myelin sheaths surrounding neurons. Thisresults in compromised nerve conduction and myriad pathologies including pain vision losscognitive deficits and eventual paralysis. It is currently incurable. Due to its early life onset(typically in the third or fourth decade) and that it progressively worsens over time an MSdiagnosis tragically sentences patients to a prolonged battle representing a significant health andfinancial burden for nearly 1 million Americans. Understanding the complex immune cell interplaygoverning pathogenesis and regulation of disease is critical for the discovery of novel therapeuticsfor patients. The MS mouse model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) hasprovided great insights into these processes and has focused on CD4 T cells (CD4s) which canadoptively transfer paralysis to healthy mice. The role of B cells and CD8 T cells (CD8s) havebeen understudied in comparison. Targeted B cell-depletion success in recent MS clinical trialshas renewed intense interest in the role these cells play in demyelinating disease. However mostEAE models do not account for pathogenic B cells where myelin peptide-induced models (eg.MOG35-55) exhibit EAE in B-less mice. Full-length recombinant human MOG (hMOG) proteininduces B cell-dependent EAE but its production is biochemically cumbersome time-consumingand expensive representing a barrier of access to efficient investigation of B cells in EAE.Additionally MOG is a minor component and buried within the myelin structure and rodent MOGhas residue differences with human MOG that render its induced EAE B cell-independent. Myelinproteolipid protein (PLP) in contrast is the most abundant myelin protein and shares 100% aminoacid sequence homology between mouse and human. However like MOG35-55 PLP178-191 inducesB cell-independent EAE. We therefore designed a novel peptide encompassing the extracellulardomains of PLP and have found that it drives a robust B cell-dependent EAE. Our group hasdemonstrated that myelin-specific CD8s in human PBMC have regulatory function and aredefective at inhibiting CD4s in MS patients. Further PLP178-191-specific CD8s suppress EAE andeven eliminate paralysis in mice. Thus B cell interactions with pathogenic CD4s and regulatoryCD8s (direct or through TFH cells) can be studied in our novel model. This PLP-driven B cell-dependent murine model of MS will be developed in the proposed work and will not only advancethe fields technical capability but serve as a much-needed arena for investigating B cells in EAE.","Adoptive Transfer;Affect;American;Amino Acid Sequence Homology;Antibodies;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antigens;Autoimmune;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;B-Cell Activation;B-Lymphocytes;Biochemical;Biology;Blindness;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;CNS Demyelinating Autoimmune Diseases;CNS autoimmunity;Cell Communication;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular biology;Clinical Trials;Cognitive deficits;Consumption;Demyelinating Diseases;Demyelinations;Dependence;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Exhibits;Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis;Extracellular Domain;Financial Hardship;Flow Cytometry;Freund&apos;s Adjuvant;Health;Healthcare;Histologic;Human;Immune;Immunization;Immunize;Inflammatory;Investigation;Kinetics;Length;Life;Link;MHC Class I Genes;Measures;Mediating;Methodology;Minor;Modeling;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Myelin;Myelin Proteins;Myelin Proteolipid Protein;Myelin Sheath;Nature;Nerve Degeneration;Neural Conduction;Neuraxis;Neurons;Pain;Paralysed;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathology;Patients;Peptides;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Play;Process;Production;Proteins;Proteolipids;Reagent;Recombinants;Regulation;Relapse;Reporting;Research Personnel;Rodent;Role;Structure;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;Testing;Time;Tissues;Work;autoreactivity;cell type;central nervous system demyelinating disorder;cytokine;design;human disease;in vivo;insight;interest;mouse model;multiple sclerosis patient;novel;novel therapeutics;oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein;protein aminoacid sequence;recruit;response;success;tositumomab","Role of B cell interactions in CNS autoimmune demyelination","PROJECT NARRATIVEMultiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the central nervous systemaffecting nearly 1 million Americans.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Mental Health; Pediatric","There are 1.8 billion young people in the world today. If engaged effectively youth are resources and agents of change in their communities. Involving youth in work that impacts their communities has positive outcomes for youth wellbeing; and for their communities. But youth are often marginalized particularly in humanitarian settings. Youth wellbeing is linked to seven key protective factors: positive emotions hope relationships meaning accomplishments autonomy and engagement. Understanding protective factors as potential mechanisms for intervention-related change in wellbeing is a priority for research in humanitarian settings. If youth are to be meaningfully engaged as intervention agents their work should focus on a community need. Humanitarian crises increase mental health disorders; and `normal' distress and psychological reactions affect a large percentage of the population. Yet human resources for health are often insufficient to meet needs. Understanding the capacities of youth to support communities in the context of disasters has been noted as a research imperative. Globally task-sharing interventions train non-professional lay community members to provide mental health care. As one example Problem Management Plus (PM+) trains community mental health workers (CMHW) and is effective in humanitarian settings for common mental disorders and for mental distress and other problems that emerge in response to crises. We propose to engage youth  aged 18-24 years as youth CMHW to implement PM+ with at-risk adults (18+ years) in their communities. The Syrian refugee crises one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history provides a relevant setting to implement this project. Lebanon hosts ~1.5 million Syrian refugees and about 60% of Syrian refugees aged 15-24 years are not employed and not in school. The Specific Aims are:  Aim 1: Assess the effectiveness of being a Y-CMHW on their wellbeing resilience and stress levels; as compared to an equivalent control group (ECG) of Syrian refugee peers. Aim 2: Identify the mechanisms associated with changes in wellbeing resilience and stress. Our conceptual model describes links between the intervention the mechanisms and outcomes. Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility acceptability and fidelity of Syrian refugee youth as CMHW implementing PM+ with clients using RE-AIM as a framework for collecting implementation data. A community-engaged research approach will involve community members including youth in all aspects of the research project. Our results will (a) elucidate critical mechanisms through which engagement of youth to support their community enhances their own wellbeing; (b) inform research around humanitarian/refugee settings mental health and Y-CMHW interventions; and (c) provide a robust basis for a follow-up study via a larger RCT. Though we assess the impact of Y- CMHW in the Syrian refugee context the premise of this intervention and its findings are equally relevant to natural emergency situations/disasters such as in the USA.","Adult;Affect;Agriculture;Anxiety;Area;Biological Markers;Client;Communities;Community Health Aides;Control Groups;Country;Data;Data Collection;Disasters;Distress;Educational Intervention;Emergency Situation;Evaluation;Follow-Up Studies;Furniture;Gender;Goals;Hair;Health Resources;Healthcare;Human Resources;Hydrocortisone;Incentives;Individual;Intervention;Lebanon;Life Stress;Link;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Mental disorders;Methods;Modeling;Natural Disasters;Outcome;Personal Satisfaction;Population;Psyche structure;Randomized Controlled Trials;Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation and Maintenance;Reaction;Recording of previous events;Refugees;Research;Research Priority;Research Project Grants;Resources;Risk;Sampling;Schools;Stress;Surveys;Testing;Training;Unemployment;Work;Youth;aged;community engaged research;community involvement;design;effectiveness evaluation;experience;group intervention;interpersonal conflict;intervention program;low and middle-income countries;member;peer;positive emotional state;protective factors;psychologic;resilience;response;therapy development;tool","Youth as community mental health workers in humanitarian settings: A pilot test of the mechanisms of effect on their own well being","Project NarrativeResults of this research will elucidate critical mechanisms through which engagement of youthto support their community's mental health enhances their own wellbeing; and inform researcharound humanitarian settings mental health and community health workers interventions.","NIMH","10105621","8/31/2021","RFA-MH-18-706","1R34MH121558-01A1","1","R34","MH","121558","01","A1","CAMPBELL-ROSEN, HOLLY RENEE","9/1/2021","8/31/2024","Special Emphasis Panel[ZMH1 ERB-K (09)]"," ","8866669","AFIFI, RIMA ","NAKKASH, RIMA ","01","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2021","8/31/2022"," ","242","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021","225684"," ","NIMH","174574","51110"," ","225684",

The pig is an excellent model of human biology due to similaritiesof size physiology and genetics and in some cases may be superior to rodent models which often fail to providedata which effectively translates to human clinical trials. Thus pig models that more accurately model humansare critically needed to improve research outcomes of regenerative medicine therapeutics and maximize safetranslation to the clinic. As SCID pig models show promise in xenograft studies this establishes further needsfor humanized pigs as second-generation models and improved methods to routinely rear immunodeficient pigsfor measurement of survival safety and potential efficacy of implanted therapeutic cells. We are focused ongenerating such new knowledge and demonstrating SCID pig use in preclinical regenerative medicine research. We have developed biocontainment facilities and protocols to raise Artemis (ART)-mutant SCID pigs. Wehave demonstrated this model's significance through successful ectopic engraftment with human inducedpluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and human cancer cell lines as well as survival of orthotopically transplantedhuman skin. To improve the model we mutated the Interleukin 2 Receptor gamma gene (IL2RG) in a male ARTnull background. The ART null IL2RG null pig has the expected T-B-NK- phenotype and we have successfullydemonstrated partial human immune system development in these ART-IL2RG pigs. Thus we have takenpioneering steps to establish a pig SCID model but improvements in xenograft safety/efficacy testing andhumanization remain prerequisites to harness these research models for translational medicine. The specific objectives of this application are to a) validate SCID pig models for preclinical testing of cell andtissue xenografts b) use multiple novel humanization approaches to determine the extent of humanhematopoiesis in SCID pigs and c) establish second-generation SCID pig model management protocols atmultiple biocontainment facilities. The rationale for the proposed research is that our outbred SCID pig may moreaccurately reflect how proposed stem cell derived therapies will function in humans compared to mice. Thisproject is innovative because we will use an integrated approach to combine research on the model's xenograftpotential with research focused on protocols for improving the use of immunodeficient pigs includinghumanization methods. We expect that the successful completion of this project will create genetic resourcesdata on xenograft and humanization rates and associated animal procedures that will be highly desirable forSCID based modeling for research on the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapeutics. These unique resourcesare expected to have a significant impact in accelerating the translation of regenerative medicine research intothe clinic.","Academia;Advisory Committees;Age;Age-Months;Animal Model;Animals;B-Lymphocytes;Bone Marrow;Breeding;CD3 Antigens;Cancer cell line;Cardiac Myocytes;Cell Therapy;Cells;Clinic;Clinical Trials;Communication;Communities;Community Medicine;Data;Drug Implants;Engraftment;Family suidae;Fetus;Funding;Future;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic stem cells;Human;Human Biology;Immune;Immune system;Immunophenotyping;In Vitro;Industry;Injections;Interleukin 2 Receptor Gamma;Knowledge;Link;Location;Longevity;Measurement;Methods;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibody R24;Mus;Mutate;Natural Killer Cells;Neonatal;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcomes Research;Phenotype;Physiology;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Procedures;Protocols documentation;Regenerative Medicine;Reporting;Research;Resources;Rodent Model;Safety;Skin;Systems Development;T-Lymphocyte;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Thymus Gland;Tissues;Translating;Translations;Transplantation;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;artemis;base;biocontainment facility;cancer therapy;conditioning;efficacy testing;fetal;genetic resource;genetic testing;genome editing;human model;improved;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;innovation;interest;intraperitoneal;male;mutant;neonatal human;novel;pathogen;porcine model;postnatal;pre-clinical;safety study;safety testing;stem cell therapy;stem cells;tool;translational medicine;translational model;transplant model","Developing second generation SCID pig models: filling the gaps to improve translation of therapeutics in regenerative medicine","Project NarrativeThe promise of stem cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine is not currently being fullyrealized due to the lack of appropriate pre-clinical large animal models.

Preventative options are poor and the onlyeffective treatment is the delivery of the often pre-term fetus and the dysfunctional placenta. The currentproposal aims to investigate the potential of personalized medicine in the form of cellular immunotherapy asa novel preventative measure for the prevention of preeclampsia.Elevated secretion of arginine vasopressin precedes the development of physiological symptoms ofpreeclampsia in humans and infusion of vasopressin throughout gestation into wild-type mice is sufficient toinitiate the cardiovascular renal and immune dysregulation observed in human preeclampsia. Althoughvascular and renal complications are observed clinically in preeclampsia immune dysfunction is central to thepathogenesis of preeclampsia. Regulatory dendritic cells have been shown to induce immune tolerance andare a current cellular immunotherapy in ongoing clinical trials for several other immune mediated diseases.The proposed study will test the hypothesize that treatment with regulatory dendritic cells will prevent thecardiovascular renal and immune features of preeclampsia.The overall objective of this proposal is to determine if DCreg administration is a potential preventative forpreeclampsia. In the following aims utilizing the chronic AVP infusion mouse model of preeclampsia and primaryhuman mononuclear cells we will investigate 1) the potential of DCreg to prevent the cardiovascular renal andimmune features of preeclampsia in mice and 2) the ability of human mononuclear cells obtained from womenwith chronic hypertension and/or preeclampsia to differentiate into functional DCreg.The vision for my career is to develop an independent NIH-funded research program that transforms womenscardiovascular healthcare through innovative scientific discovery and the education of future scientists. Tocontinue to grow as an independent investigator and to achieve my career goals the objective of the careerplan is to develop skills in the following areas: 1) training in assessment of vascular function as it relates tomodels of preeclampsia; and 2) developing skills in translational clinical research. These will be accomplishedthrough both didactic coursework and experiential training through direct interactions with my mentors andcolleagues.If regulatory dendritic cells prevent preeclampsia in the present study this data will identify a novel cellularimmunotherapy for preventing preeclampsia. Future studies would be aimed at further understanding themechanism(s) of regulatory dendritic cell action and the potential of regulatory dendritic cells in preventingpreeclampsia.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","5. Project Summary/AbstractAcute lung injury (ALI) is a syndrome of respiratory failure characterized by protein-rich pulmonary edema thatcauses severe hypoxemia and labored breathing. In the United States the annual incidence of ALI is about200000 with a mortality rate of 30-40%; yet there is no FDA-approved pharmacological therapy for ALI.Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating white blood cells in the human body and provide the first line ofdefense against invading pathogens. In the lung while neutrophils are essential for pathogen eliminationexuberant accumulation and prolonged survival of neutrophils in the interstitial and alveolar spaces contributeto ALI by releasing a variety of injurious molecules including neutrophil elastase (NE) metalloproteasesreactive oxygen species (ROS) and other proteolytic enzymes. Although all these injurious moleculescontribute to ALI an increasing body of studies have demonstrated that NE is the most potent hydrolyticenzyme that plays a key role in lung alveolar injury and that inhibition of NE with small molecular inhibitors[e.g. Sivelestat (Siv)] reduces measures of lung injury and inflammation in animal models of ALI. Howeverclinical studies have not yet provided a clear consensus. Whereas in Japanese phase III clinical trials Sivimproved pulmonary functions in North American multicenter studies Siv rather increased long-term mortalityby unknown mechanisms. Thus identification of molecular events associated with adverse effects of Siv in ALIis an important task for the development of novel and combination treatment regimens. Recently in unbiasedfunctional protease purification experiments we discovered that NE cleaves receptor interacting protein 1(RIP1) and that inhibition of NE with Siv leads to RIP1-dependent necroptosis in mouse and humanneutrophils following treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or TNF. Such RIP1-induced necroptosis can beinhibited by RIP1 kinase inhibitors (e.g. Nec-1s) or knockout (KO) of RIP3. We found that LPS/Siv-inducednecroptosis was significantly inhibited in RIP3 KO neutrophils. Importantly in a mouse model of ALI induced by50% lethal dose of LPS Siv in combination with Nec-1s resulted in 90% survival of the mice (P=0.001)whereas neither Siv nor Nec-1s alone afforded significant protection against the death. Thus we hypothesizethat inhibition of NE with Siv in ALI leads to RIP1-mediated necroptosis in neutrophils which causes secondaryinflammation and lung injury and that inhibition of RIP1-mediated necroptosis significantly improves theeffectiveness of NE inhibitors in ALI.

One form of repetitive brain stimulation is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS hasrevolutionized the field of therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders  it is a novel noninvasive treatmentoption used most commonly for medication-refractory major depressive disorder. Despite this remission ratesfrom its use are suboptimal and ideal stimulation parameters are unknown.Suboptimal outcomes are due in large part to our poor understanding of TMS neurophysiology andantidepressant effects. TMS is thought to work by altering brain excitability within a network of targeted brainstructures; for depression this target is an emotional network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Theability of the brain to change excitability in response to repeated stimuli is referred to as plasticity. Noninvasivemethods of measuring plasticity such as scalp EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are oftenimprecise and unreliable. This project proposes a novel method to invasively characterize brain plasticityinduced by intracranial stimulation (Aim 1) or TMS (Aim 2) with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution. Themethod involves using iEEG single-pulse evoked potentials to probe and quantify excitability change (acorrelate of plasticity) after repetitive stimulation in epilepsy patients. Network connectivity profiles will beanalyzed with both iEEG and resting state MRI (Aim 3) to provide a unique bridge between invasive andnoninvasive physiology measures. This project tests the hypothesis that repetitive brain stimulation(delivered via TMS and intracranial stimulation) will alter brain excitability in a parameter-dependentmanner and these effects will be most pronounced within the nodes of the stimulated brain network.A better understanding of how repetitive stimulation propagates through brain networks and alters brainexcitability will revitalize the to-date fruitless search for reproducible biomarkers of target engagement andtreatment response with these new technologies. Novel aspects of this study include the use of TMS in humansubjects with iEEG and the unique combination of both invasive and noninvasive connectivity measures (iEEGand MRI) to deeply characterize network effects of stimulation. Future directions will be 1) using this method toevaluate and refine novel brain stimulation protocols to optimize plasticity and therapeutic efficacy and 2)applying learned principles about network effects of repetitive stimulation to inform clinical trial design andtherapeutic use in other brain disorders such as depression. The University of Iowa and this mentor teamprovide a rich research environment and world-class facilities for implementing this proposal. These K23activities align with my long-term career goal of optimizing therapeutic brain stimulation to improve patient care.","Affect;Anterior;Antidepressive Agents;Area;Beds;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain region;Clinical;Clinical Trials Design;Data;Disease remission;Electric Stimulation;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional;Environment;Epilepsy;Evoked Potentials;Future;Generations;Goals;Gold;Human;Implanted Electrodes;Individual;Insula of Reil;Intractable Epilepsy;Iowa;Lateral;Light;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Maps;Measures;Mental Depression;Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award;Mentors;Mentorship;Methodology;Methods;Modality;Monitor;Moods;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Parietal Lobe;Patient Care;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiologic pulse;Physiology;Prefrontal Cortex;Protocols documentation;Psychotherapy;Refractory;Reproducibility;Research;Resolution;Rest;Scalp structure;Seizures;Site;Stimulus;Structure;Surface;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Uses;Training;Transcranial magnetic stimulation;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Universities;Work;antidepressant effect;base;career;cingulate cortex;depressed patient;design;disability;experience;human subject;improved;indexing;neurophysiology;neuropsychiatric disorder;neuroregulation;new technology;novel;novel strategies;persistent symptom;repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation;response;spatiotemporal;standard measure;targeted biomarker;tool;treatment response","Investigating Network Plasticity Effects of Repetitive Brain Stimulation Following Invasive and Noninvasive Methods in Humans","Project NarrativeThis research will help develop our understanding of how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation andelectrical stimulation affect the brain.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Hearing Loss; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rehabilitation","Project SummaryCochlear implant (CI) electrode arrays are made of platinum wires and contacts encased in a silastic housing.These materials provide mechanical stability and flexibility critical to the long-term function of the device.However they also induce local tissue reactions that can have detrimental effects. For example the fibroticcapsule that encases CI electrode arrays leads to increased impedances and signal broadening whichdecreases the effectiveness of the device. Further intracochlear fibrosis is implicated in the loss of acoustichearing that can occur months to years after implantation. Beyond fibrosis bacterial adhesion to CI materialscan lead to infection and often requires removal of the CI. Thus developing materials that mitigate the fibrousresponse and bacterial adhesion to CI materials could significantly improve device function and safety. Ultra-low fouling zwitterionic polymers are a new class of materials that show significant promise to eliminate fibrosisand bacterial adhesion. However as bulk materials they lack mechanical properties and long term durabilitysuitable for use in CIs. To leverage the ultra-low fouling surface properties of zwitterionic polymers whilemaintaining the proven mechanical properties of current CI materials we recently developed a novelphotochemical process for simultaneous polymerization grafting and cross-linking of durable zwitterionic thinfilms on relevant CI materials. We hypothesize that durable cross-linked zwitterionic thin film coatingsgenerated through photopolymerization will maintain long-term anti-fouling properties direct cell growth anddramatically reduce fibrosis and bacterial adhesion. In Aim 1 the effect of cross-link density on mechanicalstability and durability will be examined by increasing molecular weight and concentration of the cross-linker.To elucidate the direct relationship between cross-link density and anti-fouling properties protein adsorptionand cell adhesion will be assessed. The inherent spatial control of photopolymerization enables precisepatterning of the thin films. Accordingly Aim 2 examines the effect of photopatterned zwitterionic coatings tospatially control cell adhesion (fibroblasts and astrocytes) and alignment (Schwann cells and spiral ganglionneurons SGNs). Further the impact of coating patterning on intracochlear fibrosis and ossification hearinglevels and hair cell and SGN counts will be assessed. Finally Aim 3 determines the ability of zwitterioniccoatings to resist bacterial adhesion and persistence. The efficacy of these coatings on three different bacterialtypes Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be assessedboth in vitro and in vivo. Development of adherent and durable zwitterionic thin film coatings on polymers (e.g.silastic polyurethanes polyethylene etc.) and metals (e.g. platinum titanium etc.) represents a transformativeadvance to improve the function and reduce the infection risk associated with placement of medical devices inthe body.","Acoustics;Adherence;Adhesions;Adsorption;Astrocytes;Bacteria;Bacterial Adhesion;Bacterial Infections;Behavior;Biocompatible Materials;Cell Adhesion;Cell-Matrix Junction;Cells;Cicatrix;Clinical;Cochlea;Cochlear Implants;Crosslinker;Data;Development;Devices;Effectiveness;Engineering;Equilibrium;Excision;Fibroblasts;Fibrosis;Film;Friction;Growth;Hair Cells;Hearing;Housing;Image;Implant;Implanted Electrodes;In Vitro;Infection;Lead;Light;Masks;Measures;Mechanics;Medical Device;Membrane Proteins;Metals;Methods;Modulus;Molecular Weight;Monitor;Neurites;Neurons;Pattern;Performance;Periodicity;Photochemistry;Physiologic Ossification;Platinum;Polyethylenes;Polymers;Polyurethanes;Prevention;Process;Property;Proteins;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Rattus;Reaction;Resistance;Safety;Schwann Cells;Signal Transduction;Silastic;Staphylococcus aureus;Staphylococcus epidermidis;Surface;Surface Properties;Technology;Testing;Thinness;Tissues;Titanium;Water;Width;bacterial resistance;base;capsule;cell growth;chemical group;crosslink;density;electric impedance;flexibility;functional outcomes;hearing impairment;implant associated infection;implant material;implantation;improved;improved functioning;in vivo;infection risk;learning materials;mechanical properties;medical implant;neuroprosthesis;new technology;novel;photopolymerization;polymerization;preservation;prevent;response;spiral ganglion;subcutaneous","Reduction of intracochlear fibrosis and bacterial infection using photopolymerized durable zwitterionic coatings on cochlear implant biomaterials","Project Narrative: Although cochlear implants represent the most successful neuroprosthesis in clinical usethe materials used to make the implant induce scarring in the cochlea that has detrimental effects on devicefunction.

"Genetics; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACTDNA damage-mediated genome instability is a contributing factor in the causation of human diseases includingneurodegeneration immunological disorders and cancer. Understanding how cells prevent and manage DNAdamage is highly significant. R loop a transcription-linked 3 nucleic-acid structure consisting of a RNA:DNAhybrid and a displaced single-strand DNA (ssDNA) when decorated with histone H3S10p mark causes genomicinstability upon its cleavage into DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Currently nothing is known about R loopdysfunction in the causation of human primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDDs) aka inborn errors ofimmunity. Using a PID disease model of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) we recently discovered anessential nuclear role of WASp the protein deficient in WAS in limiting R loop-mediated DNA damage in CD4+T helper 1 (Th1) lymphocytes. This discovery has opened up a new avenue of research into how WASp anucleocytoplasmic protein with dual-roles in F-actin polymerization and gene transcription ensures R loop-linkedgenome stability. The current proposal seeks to define the nuclear signaling pathways and mechanisms involvedin ensuring a healthy R loop balance and therefore a stable genome in human Th cells and how theirdisruptions by WAS gene mutations is causally-linked to the development of immune deficiency and clinicalphenotypes in WAS. Aim 1 focuses on defining chromatin-based mechanisms by which WASp influences thebalance between beneficial (good) R loops and deleterious (bad) R loops and their effects in the causationof WAS Th1 and WAS Th2 cellular phenotypes. Aim 2 will clarify the mechanism of the newly identified mRNAsplicing defect in WAS Th cells as it relates to R loop formation and genome instability. Aim 3 will utilize primaryT cells from multiple WAS patients of differing clinical severities to establish R loop load in the T cells as adynamic disease biomarker and to define the involvement of nuclear-F-actin effects of WASp in WASphenotype development. In the long-term the knowledge gained from these studies will foster the developmentof novel prognostics diagnostics and therapeutics for this PID and other R loop-mediated immunologicaldisorders.","Actins;Affect;Antibody-mediated protection;Apoptosis;Attenuated;Autoimmune;Autoimmunity;B-Lymphocytes;Binding;Biological Markers;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Nucleus;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Immunity;Chromatin;Clinical;Coupled;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Polymerase II;Data;Defect;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease model;Double Strand Break Repair;Ensure;Equilibrium;Etiology;Event;F-Actin;Fostering;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genome Stability;Genomic Instability;Goals;Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor;Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte;Hereditary Disease;Histones;Human;Hybrids;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immunity;Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes;Infection;Interferon Type II;Knowledge;Link;Location;Lymphocyte;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant lymphoid neoplasm;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Monitor;Nerve Degeneration;Nuclear;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Physical condensation;Play;Polymers;Prognostic Marker;Proteins;Publishing;RNA;RNA Splicing;Research;Research Support;Role;SRSF2 gene;Severities;Severity of illness;Shapes;Signal Pathway;Single-Stranded DNA;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Th2 Cells;Therapeutic;WASP protein;Wasps;Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome;adaptive immune response;atopy;base;clinical phenotype;congenital immunodeficiency;human disease;human model;immune function;insight;mRNA Precursor;mortality;novel;nucleic acid structure;polymerization;prevent;prognostic;relating to nervous system;repaired","Mechanisms of R loop-mediated genome instability in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome","Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is associated with high mortality from infections autoimmunityand cancer.

"Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","PROJECT SUMMARYGhrelin is a circulating orexigenic hormone mainly secreted by the stomach during fasting periods to signalhunger to the brain. Ghrelin regulates food intake and energy expenditure by acting at its receptor the GrowthHormone Secretagogue Receptor 1a (GHSR1a). The effect of ghrelin on food intake and energy homeostasisare mediated centrally through the activation of AGRP/NPY neurons and global or central deletion of the ghrelinreceptor protects from diet-induced obesity. For this reason GHSR1a is a promising target for the treatment ofobesity and antagonists of the ghrelin receptor have been developed for this purpose however their promiscuityor low bioavailabilty precludes them from being used in the clinic. New compounds with improved pharmaco-chemical properties and better in-vivo efficacy could likely be identified by using more relevant drug discoverystrategies. Improvement of screening strategies will require a better understanding of GHSR1a regulation. Wehave recently discovered that the orexigenic effect of ghrelin is lost in mice in which the Melanocortin ReceptorAccessory Protein 2 (MRAP2) was deleted. Our preliminary results demonstrate that MRAP2 interacts withGHSR1a and strongly potentiates ghrelin-stimulated signaling downstream of the receptor. Additionally we showthat MRAP2 is expressed in the ghrelin responsive AGRP/NPY neurons. Consistent with those findings we showthat AGRP neurons from MRAP2 KO mice fail to activate in response to starvation. Experiments proposed inthis project will take advantage of several animal models that allow the targeted modulation of MRAP2 expression and the measurement of ghrelin signaling in specific neurons. The goal of this proposal is to 1) Identify therole of MRAP2 in promoting ghrelin signaling and starvation response of AGRP neurons; 2) Identify the mechanisms through which MRAP2 enhances to efficacy of GHSR1a signaling. The studies in aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the modulation of MRAP2 expression in AGRP neurons alters hunger sensing and ghrelin actionsin the brain. The studies in aim 2 will test the hypothesis that MRAP2 potentiates GHSR1a signaling both in-vivo and in-vitro by interfering with the desensitization of the receptor. This research is significant becausesuccessful completion will provide fundamental information on the role and mechanism of action of MRAP2 inAGRP neurons as it pertains to ghrelin functions advance our understanding of AGRP neurons regulation andhypothalamic control of energy homeostasis. This research is innovative because completion will generate novelknowledge on the regulation of G-Protein Coupled receptors by accessory proteins and identify MRAP2 as anovel energy sensor in AGRP neurons. We will also be using innovative mouse model generated in our laboratory to accurately detect and genetically modulate the expression of MRAP2 in a tissue specific manner. Ultimately the completion of this project will provide critical insights in the regulation of GHSR1a identify an obligatory accessory protein of this receptor and enable the design of drug discovery strategies targeting ghrelinsignaling that will be far more physiologically relevant and more likely to succeed than previous attempts.","Address;Affinity;Animal Model;Appetite Stimulants;Binding Sites;Biological Availability;Blood Circulation;Brain;Brain region;Chemosensitization;Clinic;Data;Development;Dimerization;Drug Design;Eating;Energy Metabolism;Fasting;Food Energy;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;GHS-R1a;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;Hormones;Hunger;Hypothalamic structure;In Vitro;Injections;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Laboratories;Ligand Binding;Maintenance;Measurement;Mediating;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Morbid Obesity;Mus;Neurons;Obesity;PROKR1 gene;Pathogenicity;Patients;Physiological;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Rodent;Role;Signal Transduction;Starvation;Stomach;Testing;Tissues;United States National Institutes of Health;beta-arrestin;chemical property;desensitization;diet-induced obesity;drug discovery;expectation;experimental study;genetic variant;ghrelin;ghrelin receptor;growth hormone secretagogue receptor;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;melanocortin receptor;mouse model;novel;obesity treatment;prevent;protein complex;receptor;receptor internalization;recruit;response;screening;sensor;severe early onset obesity;small molecule;trafficking","Investigating the requirement of MRAP2 for ghrelin function","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research addresses the major public health issue of obesity by investigating the role of therecently identified GPCR/Accessory protein complex GHSR1a/MRAP2 in the regulation of hunger sensingand energy expenditure.

"Breastfeeding, Lactation and Breast Milk; Digestive Diseases; Hematology; Infectious Diseases; Nutrition; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn; Prevention; Sepsis","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTInfection is the leading cause of mortality during the neonatal period. Early onset sepsis (EOS) which occurswithin the first 3-5 days after birth has a mortality rate of approximately 25%. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one ofthe leading causes of EOS in both term and preterm infants. Prompt initiation of antibiotics is crucial to survivalin EOS but is challenging because EOS presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms without reliablebiomarkers to aid in diagnosis. Empiric antibiotic therapy for all critically ill neonates is problematic becauseunnecessary antibiotic exposure is associated with numerous short and long-term morbidities includingnecrotizing enterocolitis sepsis beyond the first five days of life and persistent wheezing and asthma duringchildhood. This highlights the need to identify additional therapies to treat EOS. Historically neonatalsusceptibility to infection has been attributed to developmental immaturity of the immune system. Howevermore recent work suggests that neonatal innate immune cells can mount robust and effective immuneresponses in many contexts. This points to the need for more research into immune cell independent defectsthat may contribute to neonatal infection susceptibility. Iron is a trace nutrient required for the survival of allorganisms and is known to play a critical role during infection. Preliminary data in this proposal demonstratesthat 1) neonatal mice infected with E. coli rapidly die from the infection while adults readily clear the disease; 2)neonatal mice mount a rapid and robust anti-microbial response to the infection that is equivalent to theresponse in adult mice; 3) neonatal mice have increased intraperitoneal total iron that allows for rapidunchecked growth of the E. coli; and 4) targeting this excess intraperitoneal iron improves neonatal survivalduring E. coli infection. While iron metabolism in adults has been well-described little is known about ironmetabolism during the neonatal period. It is likely that neonates have unique iron metabolism without the fullrange of iron withholding strategies necessary to prevent infections. The central hypothesis of this proposalis that neonatal mice have increased iron available for bacterial consumption due to a uniquemechanism of iron acquisition both during gestation and while breastfeeding as well as altered ironwithholding capabilities. The overall goal of this proposal is to target this iron-rich niche to improvesurvival in neonatal sepsis. This hypothesis will be investigated via the following specific aims: 1) Determinethe proportion of increased neonatal available iron that accumulates during gestation versus the proportion thataccumulates during breastfeeding; 2) Explore the impact of decreasing intestinal iron absorption andincreasing serum transferrin during the neonatal period on neonatal iron status and outcomes in neonatal E.coli sepsis; 3) Determine the impact of inhibiting E. coli iron acquisition systems on outcomes in neonatal E.coli sepsis.","Adult;Allergic Disease;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Asthma;Autoimmune Diseases;Bacteria;Biological Markers;Birth;Blood Volume;Brain;Breast Feeding;Cattle;Cells;Cessation of life;Childhood;Consumption;Critical Illness;Data;Defect;Deferoxamine;Developing Countries;Development;Diagnosis;Diet;Dietary Iron;Disease;Enteral;Erythrocytes;Escherichia coli;Escherichia coli Infections;Fostering;Gallium;Glutamine;Goals;Gram-Negative Bacteria;Greater sac of peritoneum;Growth;Human Milk;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Incidence;Infection;Infection prevention;Intake;Intestines;Iron;Iron Isotopes;Iron Uptake Inhibition;Lactation;Lactoferrin;Lead;Life;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Necrotizing Enterocolitis;Neonatal;Neonatal Mortality;Organism;Outcome;Passive Immunization;Peritoneal;Play;Predisposition;Pregnancy;Premature Infant;Recycling;Research;Risk;Role;SLC11A2 gene;Sepsis;Serum;Siderophores;Signs and Symptoms;Source;Supplementation;System;Tissues;Trace Elements Nutrition;Transferrin;United States;Virulent;Wheezing;Work;antimicrobial;clinically relevant;combat;dietary excess;early onset;experimental study;fitness;global health;improved;improved outcome;infancy;intestinal barrier;intraperitoneal;iron absorption;iron metabolism;microbiome;mortality;mouse model;neonatal infection;neonatal mice;neonatal period;neonatal sepsis;neonate;pathogen;pathogenic Escherichia coli;prevent;pup;rapid growth;receptor;response;senescence;siderophore receptors;success;therapeutic target;uptake","Targeting iron to improve outcomes in neonatal Escherichia coli sepsis","PROJECT NARRATIVENeonatal infections are a global health concern but why neonates are highly susceptible to infections is notwell understood.

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Neurosciences","Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization and death among those older than 65 yearsand statistic is projected to grow as our population ages. The socioeconomic impact of HF on our health caresystem is enormous. Development of innovative approaches to the treatment of HF is therefore a top researchpriority. Although inflammation and immune activation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of HF overthe past two decades the progress for development of new pharmaceutical agents targeting this mechanismwas stagnant especially given that several anti-cytokine clinical trials targeting a single effector cytokine at theperipheral manifestations of HF did not produce clinical benefits. Obviously the inflammatory mechanismsunderlying the pathogenesis of HF have not been challenged. The proposed project studying a role of braininterleukin (IL)-17A (previously known as IL-17) in advancing central inflammation sympathetic activation andcardiac dysfunction will address the need for a better understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms in HFand provide a novel anti-cytokine approach in treating this devastating disease. The research plan wasdeveloped based on the intrinsic property of IL-17A and our compelling preliminary data: 1) IL-17A is a kayinflammatory regulator bridging immune responses and tissue inflammation; 2) It boosts the expression of abroad spectrum of inflammatory mediators in the brain and in the peripheral tissue and cells; 3) Systemic andcentral administration of IL-17A induced dramatic and long-lasting increases in blood pressure heart rate andrenal sympathetic nerve activity to the levels not seen by other pre-inflammatory cytokines; 4) levels of IL-17Ain the plasma cerebrospinal fluid and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN a key cardiovascularand autonomic center of the brain) are higher in a rat model of HF vs. in sham-operated (Sham) animals; and 5)Its receptor IL-17RA is highly expressed in the PVN and substantially upregulated in HF. Using a multifacetedapproach including electrophysiology molecular biology immunocytochemistry pharmacology biochemistryand neuroscience in Sham and HF rats this project will: 1) identify the role of IL-17A in advancing centralinflammation in HF; 2) determine the inflammatory mechanisms whereby IL-17A triggers sympathetic activationin HF; 3) evaluate the protective effect of central interventions targeting the IL-17A signaling alone or incombination with other cytokines in HF.

"Brain Disorders; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Microbiome; Neurosciences; Pediatric","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTExposure of the developing brain to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and disruption of the gut microbiomehave independently been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Both phenomenalikely interact by two mechanisms to cause adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes: PCB-mediated changes inthe gut microbiome (1) alter the profile of neuroactive microbial metabolites distributed to the developing brain and(2) affect PCB disposition in the developing brain by modifying host and microbial PCB metabolism. A mechanisticunderstanding of these interactions is required to address the critical need for interventional strategies that effec-tively reduce the impact of PCB-induced NDDs on individuals families and society. The long-term goal is to de-termine the role of the gut microbiomeliverbrain axis in modulating susceptibility to PCB effects on the develop-ing brain with the objective of characterizing how dose-dependent interactions between maternal exposure to anenvironmentally relevant PCB mixture and the gut microbiome influence neurotoxic outcomes in conventional(CV) vs. germ-free (GF) juvenile mice. We will test the central hypothesis that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome as-sociated with developmental exposure to varying doses of PCBs contributes to adverse neurodevelopmental out-comes later in life. This hypothesis is based on preliminary studies showing that: (1) PCB exposure causesdysbiosis of the gut microbiome; (2) PCBs and their metabolites are present in the rodent brain; (3) the expressionof PCB-metabolizing enzymes differs between CV vs. GF mice; (4) PCB disposition differs between CV and GFmice; and (5) PCBs are developmental neurotoxicants in mice. Guided by these preliminary data the novel hy-pothesis will be tested by (a) characterizing gut microbiome composition and function and neuroactive microbialmetabolites; (b) determining how differences in host vs. microbial biotransformation affect disposition of PCBs andtheir metabolites; and (c) examining neuroinflammation oxidative stress synaptic connectivity and behavior indams and fetuses/pups derived from (i) CV vs.GF dams exposed to PCBs in the diet and (ii) GF dams who re-ceived a fecal transplant from PCB-exposed or vehicle control CV dams. The proposed research is innovativebecause it uses a systems biology approach in a state-of-the-art mouse model to assess the role of the gut mi-crobiomeliverbrain axis in modulating neurotoxic outcomes following exposure to an environmental PCB mix-ture. The anticipated outcome of these studies is a new research paradigm demonstrating that developmentalexposures to PCBs mediate (1) longitudinal changes in gut microbiome composition and function and (2) alterPCB disposition in the developing brain that influence neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life. This outcomewill have a significant impact on public health by informing future studies of cellular mechanisms of the devel-opmental origin of PCB neurotoxicity and ultimately provide critical insights regarding the plausibility of micro-biome-based approaches to diagnose and treat NDDs induced by exposure to neurotoxicants.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Behavior;Brain;Cytochrome P450;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diet;Dose;Environmental Impact;Enzymes;Etiology;Evaluation;Exposure to;Family;Fetus;Future;Germ-Free;Goals;Health;Hepatic;Individual;Intervention;Knowledge;Lactation;Life;Link;Liver;Maternal Exposure;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic Biotransformation;Metabolism;Microbe;Mission;Mus;Neonatal;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neurotoxins;Organism;Outcome;Outcome Study;Oxidative Stress;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Positioning Attribute;Predisposition;Pregnancy;Public Health;Research;Rodent;Role;Societies;Synapses;Systems Biology;Testing;Toxic Environmental Substances;Transplantation;United States National Institutes of Health;adverse outcome;base;developmental neurotoxicity;dysbiosis;experimental study;fecal transplantation;gut dysbiosis;gut microbiome;human disease;innovation;insight;microbial;microbiome;microbiome alteration;microbiome composition;mother nutrition;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neurodevelopment;neuroinflammation;neurotoxic;neurotoxicity;novel;pup","PCB-mediated dysbiosis of the gut microbiome: A missing link in PCB-mediated neurodevelopmental disorders?","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe proposed research will demonstrate that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome acts in concert with direct effectsof environmental toxicants on the developing brain/liver and the influence of these interactions on neurodevel-opmental outcomes.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Complementary and Integrative Health; Estrogen; Microbiome; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition","Although the link between the immune system and the gut microbiome is being increasingly appreciated themechanistic links between the microbiome and inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis(MS) are unclear. Thus there is a critical need to define mechanisms by which gut bacteria maintain immunehomeostasis and thereby affect neuroinflammation. We have recently reported that MS patients have alteredgut microbiota compared to healthy controls with a reduced abundance of certain human gut bacteria(Parabacteroides Adlercreutzia and Prevotella) with the ability to metabolize phytoestrogen. Gut bacteriametabolize phytoestrogen into equol which has structural similarity with estrogen and can regulate immuneresponses through estrogen receptors and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Our preliminary datashowing significantly milder EAE in mice on a phytoestrogen (Isoflavones) containing diet compared to thoseon a phytoestrogen free diet suggest a critical role of phytoestrogen in modulation of EAE. AdditionallyPrevotella histicola a member of the Prevotella genus can suppress disease in experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) a preclinical murine model of MS. However the importance of phyoestrogenmetabolism in P. histicolamediated disease suppression is unknown. The central hypothesis of the proposedstudies is that the human gut commensal P. histicola mediate its disease-protective effect through metabolismof phytoestrogen and subsequent activation of immunoregulatory cells. We will test our central hypothesisusing animal model genetically modified mice and a cell culture approach in the following two specific aims. Infirst aim we will utilize P. histicola as a representative phytoestrogen-metabolizing gut commensal bacteria todetermine whether metabolism of phytoestrogen is required for ability of P. histicola to suppress disease andinduce Tregs and/or CD103+ Tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs). We will determine the importance of AMPKsignaling in the phytoestrogen induced activation of Tregs and/or tolerogenic DCs. In second aim we willdetermine whether the phytoestrogen plus bacteria mediate the induction of immunoregulatory cells viaestrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathways in intestinal epithelial cells and/or immune cells. Our study is fitfor the High Priority Immunology Grant (R01) mechanism because we are proposing to determine themechanisms underlying the microbial impact on systemic immunity which can be harnessed in designingpotential mono as well as combination therapies because drugs with diverse non-overlapping mechanismsmight provide maximal benefit to MS patients. We will determine whether phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteriamaintain a disease-free state by tilting the Tregs to Th1/Th17 balance towards Tregs through its interactionwith estrogen receptors and the AMPK pathway. We expect the outcome of our study will have a positiveimpact on development of gut microbial-flora/diet-based therapies for MS as well as other inflammatoryautoimmune diseases.","5&apos;-AMP-activated protein kinase;Address;Adult;Affect;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Autoimmune Diseases;Bacteria;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chemicals;Combined Modality Therapy;Data;Demyelinations;Dendritic Cells;Development;Diet;Disease;Eating;Epithelial Cells;Equilibrium;Estrogen Receptors;Estrogens;Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis;FOXP3 gene;Foundations;Goals;Grant;Health Benefit;Homeostasis;Human;IL2RA gene;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunology;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Intestines;Isoflavones;Knowledge;Link;Mediating;Metabolism;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Neuraxis;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phytoestrogens;Plants;Positioning Attribute;Prevotella;Protein Kinase;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Relapse;Reporting;Research Project Grants;Risk;Role;Signal Transduction;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;base;commensal bacteria;cost;design;equol;experience;gut bacteria;gut dysbiosis;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;immune function;immunoregulation;intestinal epithelium;member;microbial;microbiome;microbiota;mouse model;multiple sclerosis patient;neuroinflammation;novel therapeutics;phrases;pre-clinical;protective effect;response","Linking diet gut microbiota and autoimmune disease: Bacteria induced phytoestrogen metabolites impact immune function in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalitis","NARRATIVEDiet is one of the major factors regulating our gut microbiota and therefore the phrase that you are what youeat is so true.

"Clinical Research; Infectious Diseases","Human innate immune response to microbes depends on the coordinated interactions among a variety ofcells and secreted factors with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) typically prominent among the firstresponders. In their capacity as phagocytic cells PMN sequester ingested prey in membrane-boundphagosomes where oxidants from the NADPH oxidase and proteins from granules synergize to create a toxicenvironment that promotes death and degradation of the engulfed microbe. In certain settings a significantfraction of ingested microbes survives within PMN. The persistence of viable microbes within phagosomes notonly provides a mechanism for sustained infection but also can modulate the local inflammatory tone byaltering the programmed cell death of PMN and promoting PMN release of proinflammatory cytokines.Interference with phagocytosis-induced apoptosis of PMN (PICD) either by delaying apoptosis as seen withN. gonorrhoeae (Ngc) or engaging a novel necrotic cell death pathway as seen with Staphylococcus aureus(SA) thwarts resolution of the inflammatory response and causes release of host-derived danger signals thatpromote inflammation and secondary tissue damage. Thus effective innate immune response requires notonly death and degradation of invading microbes but also resolution of inflammation and reestablishment ofhomeostasis. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the failure of PMN to undergo apoptoticcell death derails the resolution phase of the inflammatory response and instead amplifies disease. Because activated human PMN (hPMN) and their secreted products can sculpt the inflammatory tone intissue we propose to use Ngc and SA -- both human pathogens that survive within PMN alter phagocytosis-induced cell fate pathways and elicit profound inflammatory local changes  as tools to probe mechanisms thatdictate phagocyte fate and timely resolution of inflammation. We will pursue two Specific Aims:Aim 1: To determine the mechanisms that regulate human PMN fate. A. Determine the signaling pathways that differentially direct hPMN towards survival vs programmedcell death (apoptosis vs primary necrosis). B. Determine the composition and activities of the ripoptosome (intracellular complexes) in hPMN afterphagocytosis C. Determine the role of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in the fate of phagocytosing hPMNAim 2: To determine the mechanisms underlying hPMN secretion of IL-1 during phagocytosisA.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Infectious Diseases; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","C57BL/6 mice infected with the neurotropic rJ2.2 variant of the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus(rJ2.2) develop acute and chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis and thereby serve as a usefulmodel for the human disease multiple sclerosis. The overall objective of this project has been tounderstand virus-host interactions to enhance virus clearance and minimize tissue damage. In the pastfunding period we concentrated on aspects of the T cell response that were pathogenic but protectiveand others that were regulatory dampening CD4 T cell-mediated immunopathological changes.However before a T cell response can clear virus the host must mount a well-orchestrated and robustinnate immune response. Our recent work has focused on two aspects of this early innate responseboth involving microglia which are the resident myeloid cells in the CNS. First we showed thatmicroglia are critical for protection. Although microglia have important roles in immune surveillance andmaintenance of homeostasis in the CNS their role in the context of infection remains ill-defined. Ourresults show that they are key for protection from rJ2.2 infection. Second we found that signaling of asingle eicosanoid prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) through its DP1 receptor found on myeloid cells includingmicroglia was required for optimal survival in rJ2.2-infected mice. In the absence of DP1 signaling type1 IFN (IFN-I) expression was delayed and IL-1 expression was increased suggesting that PGD2/DP1signaling was critical for a balanced immune response. The absence of PGD2/DP1 signaling resulting indysregulated microglia function. Therefore the central objective of this project is to betterunderstand the many roles that microglia have in enhancing the host response to viralinfections in the brain and thereby improving outcomes in the context of viral encephalitis (andultimately demyelinating disease). This objection will be addressed in the following specific aims.Specific Aim 1: To determine the basis for lethal outcomes in microglia-depleted rJ2.2-infected mice. Inthis aim mice will be treated with PLX6522 which depletes microglia. We will monitor virus clearanceand immune function after treatment. We will assess whether macrophage numbers function or geneexpression is changed in the absence of microglia. Specific Aim 2: To determine the role of PGD2/DP1signaling in microglia in rJ2.2-infected mice. In this aim we will assess effects of PGD2/DP1 on viralcontrol and the host immune response. We found that a PYRIN domain only protein PYDC3 wasdownregulated in microglia of mice lacking DP1 signaling. PYDC3 has similarities to IFN-I-induciblehuman proteins that regulate inflammasome formation and activation but homologous proteins have notbeen identified in mice. One of the goals of this aim is to understand the interactions and roles ofprostaglandin D2 signaling IFN-I expression and inflammasome function.","Acute;Acute Disease;Address;Affect;Aftercare;Apoptotic;Area;Brain;C57BL/6 Mouse;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cells;Central Nervous System Viral Diseases;Chronic;Defect;Demyelinating Diseases;Demyelinations;Disease;Eicosanoids;Encephalitis;Encephalomyelitis;Funding;Gene Expression;Goals;Homeostasis;Homologous Protein;Human;Immune response;Immunologic Surveillance;Infection;Inflammasome;Inflammation;Innate Immune Response;Interferons;Interleukin-1 beta;Investigation;Laboratories;MHV-JHM;Maintenance;Mediating;Microglia;Modeling;Monitor;Mouse Strains;Multiple Sclerosis;Murine hepatitis virus;Mus;Myelin;Myeloid Cells;Neurologic;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Play;Process;Prostaglandin D2;Prostaglandins;Proteins;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;T cell response;Tertiary Protein Structure;Time;Tissues;Up-Regulation;Variant;Viral;Viral Encephalitis;Viral Pathogenesis;Virus;Virus Diseases;Work;adaptive immune response;effector T cell;human disease;immune function;improved outcome;macrophage;neurotropic;neurotropic virus;new therapeutic target;receptor;response;virus host interaction","Role of microglia in MHV-induced demyelination","NarrativeViral infections of the central nervous system cause short term neurological defects and often even ifsubclinical have long term sequelae.

"Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYPathogen recognition receptors and their associated adaptors are essential for the prompt detection ofpathogens and the subsequent initiation of effective host responses and restoration of homeostasis. Over thelast decade Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have been on the forefront of innate immune research and severalgroundbreaking studies have been published to which my research has contributed. Leishmania spp. areparasites with global health importance yet the role of NLRs and their adaptors during Leishmania spp.infection has been an understudied area.Receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is an essential adaptor downstream of cytoplasmic sensorsNLRC1 and NLRC2 and play an important role in a wide variety of clinical settings including bacterial viral andfungal infections as well as non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis inflammatorybowel disease and metabolic diseases. However the role of RIPK2 during cutaneous leishmaniasis remainunknown. In this grant we propose to investigate the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms involvingRIPK2 during Leishmania major (L. major)-induced cutaneous disease. Our preliminary work has alreadyelucidated several exciting features of the role of RIPK2 during L. major infection. We found that RIPK2-deficient mice are highly susceptible to L. major infection. Unexpectedly mice deficient in NLRC2 or bothNLRC1/NLRC2 are dispensable in L. major infection suggesting a novel sensor that function upstream ofRIPK2. Moreover RIPK2 interacted with CARD9 to provide protection against L. major. Based on thesepreliminary data we propose that a novel Dectin-1/RIPK2/CARD9 signaling axis modulates anti-leishmanialimmunity.Successful completion of this project will yield a better understanding of RIPK2 biology in general unveil anovel pathway involving RIPK2 in signal transduction and potentially identify therapeutic targets to ameliorateLeishmania spp.-associated pathology.1","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Affect;Antifungal Agents;Area;BCL10 gene;Bacterial Infections;Basic Science;Biochemical;Biology;Cells;Clinical;Complex;Cutaneous Leishmaniasis;Data;Development;Disease;Etiology;Event;Family;Genetic;Goals;Grant;Homeostasis;Host resistance;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Infection;Inflammasome;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Knowledge;Lead;Leishmania;Leishmania major;Leishmaniasis;Link;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein-1;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Mycoses;Outcome;Parasites;Pathogen detection;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Phosphotransferases;Play;Predisposition;Protein Kinase;Publishing;RIPK1 gene;Receptor Activation;Research;Resistance;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Surface;Virus Diseases;Work;adaptive immune response;base;combat;dectin 1;effective therapy;global health;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;obligate intracellular parasite;pathogen;receptor;response;restoration;sensor;skin disorder;targeted treatment;therapeutic target","Implicating a previously unknown Dectin1-RIPK2-CARD9 signaling in providing resistance against Leishmania major infection","PROJECT NARRATIVELeishmaniasis despite being a global health problem that affects more than 1 billion people throughout the worldis an understudied pathogen.

"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Lung","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Mucus hypersecretion and goblet cell metaplasia are central features of many lung diseases. Notreatments exist for goblet cell metaplasia in Th2-low asthma chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Incontrast Th2-high asthma has well-described drivers (e.g. IL13) and available treatments. Patients withuntreated goblet cell metaplasia suffer disabling symptoms frequent hospitalizations and high healthcarecosts. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the role of heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) inairway goblet cell metaplasia. My central hypothesis is that inhibition of HSP90 induces goblet tociliated cell transdifferentiation. Robust preliminary data supports this hypothesis: 1) IL13 induces gobletcell metaplasia in human airway epithelia with a negative correlation between goblet and ciliated cellabundance 2) HSP90 inhibition reverts IL13- and IL17-induced goblet cell metaplasia without inducing celldeath and 3) HSP90 inhibition blocks ERBB2/EGFR signaling in IL13-stimulated airway epithelia. I proposethree specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Is HSP90 required for goblet cell metaplasia in airway epithelia? I will address this aimusing human and mouse deletion of HSP90 gene isoforms. I will expose gene-edited mice and humanairway cells in vitro to IL13 or IL17. Specific Aim 2: Does HSP90 inhibition induce transdifferentiation of goblet cells into ciliated cells? I willaddress this aim with lineage tracing of human airway cells exposed to IL13 IL17 and HSP90 inhibitors. Specific Aim 3: Is apical membrane HSP90 localization required for ERBB2 signaling in goblet cellmetaplasia? I will address this aim with protein phosphorylation and localization assays. I will exposehuman airway epithelia to HSP90 blocking antibodies before and after IL13 or IL17 stimulation. With the completion of this proposal I expect to have identified novel mechanisms and treatment targetsto revert airway goblet cell metaplasia. Treating goblet cell metaplasia caused by various triggers (e.g. IL13and IL17) may improve many lung diseases. The University of Iowa has a longstanding history of support to its junior faculty.

"Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Infections","Alphaherpesviruses encode two proteins kinases that are critical regulators of pathogenesis pUS3 and pUL13. pUS3 has multiple functions in infection including facilitation of nuclear egress protection from apoptosis promotion of viral protein synthesis and inhibition of antigen presentation to the immune system. The regulation of the activity of pUS3 is therefore of great interest both as a tool for understanding the molecular biology of herpesvirus infections and as an avenue for exploring antiviral therapies based on inhibition of its various activities. pUS3 kinase activity has been reported to be regulated both by autophosphorylation and by phosphorylation by another herpesvirus-encoded kinase pUL13. Intriguingly regulation of pUS3 activity by pUL13 appears to affect some pUS3 functions but not others. Specifically it appears to be necessary for at least some of the activities of pUS3 in egress of virus capsids from the nucleus but not for protection of infected cells from some pro-apoptotic stimuli (). These observations highlight two very significant gaps in our understanding of the interaction between pUL13 and pUS3. First it is unclear which pUS3 functions are regulated by pUL13 and what distinguished UL13-dependent from UL13-independent functions. We propose the simple hypothesis that phosphorylation of pUS3 by pUL13 specifically regulates its nuclear functions by regulating its access to the nucleus. Second the mechanism and functional significance of pUL13 regulation of pUS3 is unclear. It is known that pUL13 phosphorylates pUS3 but it is not clear whether this phosphorylation is necessary for pUL13 regulation of pUS3. A recently published proteomic analysis of HSV infected cells suggests that pUL13 phosphorylates pUS3 at S139. We will use a genetic approach to test the hypothesis that S139 is the critical residue for regulation of pUS3 by pUL13 and then to test the significance of S139 phosphorylation for viral growth and spread.","Affect;Antigen Presentation;Antiviral Therapy;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Capsid;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Cytoplasm;Event;Gold;Growth;Herpesviridae;Herpesviridae Infections;Immune system;Infection;Mediating;Molecular Biology;Nuclear;Pathogenesis;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Protein Kinase;Protein Synthesis Inhibition;Proteomics;Publishing;Regulation;Reporting;Simplexvirus;Stimulus;Testing;Viral;Viral Proteins;Virus;base;genetic approach;interest;locus ceruleus structure;tool","Mechanism and regulation of protein kinase functions in HSV nuclear egress","Many critical events in herpesvirus infections are regulated by virus protein kinases and these kinases pare promising targets for antiviral therapy.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Lung","Aspergillus fumigatus is the major human filamentous fungal pathogen. Azole drugs representthe gold standard in treatment of aspergillosis and are the only agent that can be used withouthospitalization. Problematic findings in Western Europe have shown that azole resistant formsof A. fumigatus can arise and spread frequently. These studies have demonstrated that theprimary cause of azole resistance is a compound mutation in the gene encoding the targetenzyme for azole drugs cyp51A. These linked mutations consist of an alteration in thepromoter sequence (tandem duplication of 34 base pairs: TR34) coupled with an amino acidreplacement in the coding sequence (L98H) in cyp51A. Mutant strains containing this TR34L98H cyp51A allele are highly azole drug resistant and appear to have no fitness defect leadingto the high frequency of resistant infections. We have discovered a new transcription factorcalled AtrR that binds to this TR34 element and is required for normal cyp51A expression.Importantly both we and others have found that atrR null mutants are avirulent in a mouseinhalation model of infection. Here we propose to use a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupledwith high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) dataset that we have generated to identify genesunder control of AtrR that impact virulence. We will use a mouse infection model to determineAtrR-regulated genes that exhibit transcriptional responses in the infected mouse lung.Nanostring technology will be employed to allow measurement of fungal gene expression in thehigh background of mammalian RNA. AtrR target genes will be rank ordered by their in vivoexpression profile. We will use CRISPR technology and existing disruption collections toassess the role of up to 40 AtrR target genes for their effect on an in vitro epithelial cell damageassay. Our goal will be to prioritize these genes based on their in vivo expression profile andimpact on epithelial cell damage. From these analyses we will select up to 8 target genedisruption mutants to screen for an effect on virulence using our mouse inhalation model. Thiswork will provide the first examination of the molecular basis of AtrR-mediated virulence factorsthat are critical for pathogenesis in this animal model of infected lungs.","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters;Agriculture;Alleles;Amino Acids;Animal Model;Aspergillosis;Aspergillus fumigatus;Attenuated;Azole resistance;Azoles;Base Pairing;Binding;Biological Assay;CRISPR/Cas technology;Candida albicans;Code;Collection;Complex;Coupled;Data;Data Set;Defect;Disease;Drug resistance;Elements;Enzymes;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Frequencies;Fungal Genes;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Gold;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Hospitalization;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;Infection;Inhalation;Link;Lung;Maps;Measurement;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Organism;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Positioning Attribute;Predisposition;Promoter Regions;Publishing;RNA;Resistance;Role;Specific qualifier value;Technology;Testing;Tissues;Transcript;Transcriptional Regulation;Virulence;Virulence Factors;Western Europe;Work;base;cell injury;chromatin immunoprecipitation;dosage;experimental study;fitness;fungus;in vivo;insight;mortality;mouse model;mutant;nano-string;novel;novel strategies;overexpression;pathogen;pathogenic fungus;resistant strain;response;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing","Identification of virulence determinants under the transcriptional control of AtrR in Aspergillus fumigatus","Aspergillus fumigatus is the major human filamentous fungal pathogen with mortalityreaching 90% during infections caused by drug resistant forms of this fungus.

"Cancer; Genetics; Precision Medicine; Uterine Cancer; Women's Health","While outcomes have substantially improved for many types of cancer endometrial cancer incidence anddeaths are on the rise with the five year survival rate worse today than three decades ago. Inadequatesensitivity to chemotherapy is a primary cause of therapeutic failure. To improve patient outcomes we mustidentify the appropriate molecularly targeted agents to combine with chemotherapy a concept we termmolecularly enhanced chemotherapy. Such combinations must be based upon a mechanistic understanding oftumor cell vulnerabilities which can be exploited to create synergism and synthetic lethality. Our objective inthis renewal application is to capitalize on the most common mutation in high-risk endometrial cancers p53 todesign new and more active combinatorial regimens that can improve response in the upfront setting. p53mutations alter the master regulators of cell cycle checkpoints in predictable yet distinct ways which can becapitalized upon to overcome resistance to chemotherapy using targeted agents that block compensatorysurvival pathways. Therefore our central hypothesis is that molecular inhibitors of key master regulatorschosen based upon the knowledge of the p53 mutational status synergize with chemotherapy and promotecatastrophic tumor cell death. We term this concept molecularly enhanced chemotherapy. In Specific Aim #1we will determine the role of p53 other cell cycle checkpoint controllers and angiogenic markers as predictorsof sensitivity when anti-angiogenic molecular inhibitors are combined with chemotherapy. This aimincorporates clinical specimens from a completed trial GOG/NRG 86P the first national study to combinemolecular inhibitors with chemotherapy for advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer. In Specific Aim #2 we willassess the mechanisms of resistance to therapy as defined by outcomes from NRG/GOG 86P and identifyalternative molecularly enhanced combinations. In Specific Aim #3 we will interrogate the function of p53mutations that are variants of unknown significance (VUS) to define the best therapy for these tumors. Themajor goal of this aim is to bin VUS from NRG/GOG 86P into functional categories and understand the impactof recurrent VUS on cell transcription and cell cycle regulation. At the completion of these studies it is ourexpectation that we will have designed and tested synergistic drug combinations tailored for specificendometrial cancer subtypes.

"Cancer; Chronic Pain; Complementary and Integrative Health; Dietary Supplements; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pain Research; Peripheral Neuropathy; Prevention; Women's Health","This project seeks to better understand the mechanisms that underlie painful peripheral neuropathy andparticularly to identify a new strategy to relieve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN) forwhich there are no efficacious treatments. Indeed CIPN may be so painful that it is necessary to reduce thedose of agent delay chemotherapy or even cease treatment. Furthermore the peripheral neuropathies maynot resolve with time. The dose-limiting nature and the persistence of CIPN are significant health care prob-lems. Much research in the field is driven by hypotheses that loss of intraepidermal nerve fibers (IENF) injuryto primary afferent neurons and activation of glial cells and macrophage in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG)underlie taxane-induced CIPN including a focus on mitochondrial dysfunction. Without an agent that canprevent mechanical hypersensitivity and the aversive dimension of pain it is not possible to establish thatthese mechanisms are causative of CIPN or to test the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction is an underly-ing mechanism. We propose to use nicotinamide riboside (NR) a natural product vitamin B3 precursor ofNAD+ that can correct mitochondrial dysfunction as an investigational tool. We show that a dose of NR thatincreases NAD+ levels can ameliorate the mechanical hypersensitivity and the aversive dimension of paincaused by paclitaxel in tumor-nave female rats. In contrast NR does not alleviate sensory neuropathy result-ing from frank nerve injury. This differential effect opens the door to rigorous comparative analyses of themechanisms by which NR acts to alleviate sensory neuropathy. This proposal will first extend the findings withNR to paclitaxel-induced CIPN in tumor-bearing female rats. Second it will confirm that NR does not suppressneuropathy in rats with SNI. Third it will relate the differential actions of NR to injury specific changes in NAD+biosynthetic enzymes that position DRG neurons in paclitaxel treated rats to make use of NR to correct defi-cits whereas this pathway is not available after SNI and support these studies with measurement of NAD+ inthe DRG and distal nerve. Fourth it will characterize the distribution of transcripts and protein for the biosyn-thetic enzymes among the different classes of DRG neurons and determine how they are altered by paclitaxelin tumor nave and tumor-bearing rats as well in SNI rats. Fifth it will determine whether NR prevents the lossof IENF loss of specific neuron populations as well as activation of glial cells and macrophages in the DRG.The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that the protective effects of NR are mediated by NAD+ and linkthis to its protective effects on specific subpopulations of primary sensory neurons the prevention of IEFN lossand activation of macrophages and satellite cells in DRG. This work will increase our understanding of themechanisms that underlie different types of painful sensory neuropathy possibly guide the development of anew treatment to address a significant unmet need in oncology and just as importantly provide a rationale asto why this natural product may not be a universal treatment for all types of sensory neuropathy.","Abbreviations;Address;Afferent Neurons;Biosynthetic Proteins;Cancer Patient;Cancer Survivor;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy;Clinic;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Dimensions;Distal;Dose;Dose-Limiting;Enzymes;Evidence based treatment;Female;Glutamate-ammonia-ligase adenylyltransferase;Healthcare;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Histocytochemistry;Human;Hypersensitivity;Immunohistochemistry;In Situ Hybridization;Injury;Investigation;Lead;Levocarnitine Acetyl;Link;Macrophage Activation;Maintenance;Mammary gland;Measurement;Measures;Mechanics;Mediating;Methylnitrosourea;Natural Products;Nature;Nerve;Nerve Fibers;Neurons;Neuropathy;Niacinamide;Nicotinamide Mononucleotide;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;Nicotinic Acids;Oncology;Paclitaxel;Pain;Pathway interactions;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmacotherapy;Phase;Phosphotransferases;Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases;Population;Positioning Attribute;Prevention;Rattus;Research;Rodent Model;Sirtuins;Spinal Ganglia;Sterility;Supine Position;Tactile;Testing;Time;Transcript;Translating;Vitamins;Work;avoidance behavior;chemotherapy;clinically relevant;comparative;effective therapy;efficacious treatment;glial activation;immunohistochemical markers;insight;macrophage;metabolome;mitochondrial dysfunction;nerve injury;nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;nicotinamide-beta-riboside;pre-clinical;prevent;protective effect;satellite cell;sensory neuropathy;spared nerve;taxane;tool;tumor","Mechanistic Studies of the Natural Product Nicotinamide Riboside for Relief of Painful Sensory Neuropathy","Painful peripheral neuropathies are difficult to treat and a significant health care problemparticularly in the case of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN) for which thereare no evidence-based treatments.

"Clinical Research; Hematology; Immunotherapy; Infectious Diseases; Sepsis","Project Summary/AbstractSepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Itrepresents a significant public health burden striking 1.7 million American annually (with 20-25% mortality). Ingeneral early stages of sepsis are characterized by a potentially detrimental hyperinflammatory state.However patients who survive the cytokine storm phase of sepsis enter a state of immunoparalysis defined byenhanced susceptibility to infection viral reactivation and mortality years after the septic insult. Sepsis-inducedlymphopenia reduces the number of immune cells and influences the function of remaining/surviving cells.Yet the sepsis-induced lymphopenia is transient while the prolonged immunoparalysis (orimmunosuppression) that develops (even after lymphocyte numbers normalize) is now considered a leadingreason for the extended period of increased susceptibility to bacterial and viral pathogens normally handled bythe immune system in healthy individuals. Therefore our long-term goal is to precisely determine on cellularand molecular levels sepsis-induced changes in various lymphocyte populations that support and define thechronic state of immunoparalysis and inability of immune cells to exert their effector functions properly. Weidentified four interconnected areas of research that we will pursue: a) Explore molecular mechanisms thatgovern long-term maintenance and function of infection-or vaccine-induced protective memory CD8 T cellresponses after sepsis; b) Define the cellular basis of increased susceptibility to tumor development anddecreased ability to evoke autoimmune responses in sepsis survivors; c) Develop new experimental models ofsepsis research; d) Investigate the interplay between clinical (human) and experimental (mouse) research toelucidate mechanisms and pathways that control sepsis-induced immunoparalysis state. Addressing these keygaps in our understanding of sepsis-induced immunoparalysis will ultimately uncover new targets that can beused to develop better and more efficient treatments of sepsis survivors.","Address;American;Area;Autoimmune Responses;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Development;Experimental Models;Functional disorder;Goals;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunosuppression;Individual;Infection;Life;Lymphocyte;Lymphocyte Count;Lymphopenia;Maintenance;Memory;Molecular;Mus;Organ;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Population;Predisposition;Public Health;Research;Secondary to;Sepsis;Survivors;T cell response;Vaccines;Viral;cytokine release syndrome;mortality;pathogenic bacteria;pathogenic virus;secondary infection;septic;tumor","Cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling sepsis-induced immunoparalyses state","Project NarrativeThe majority of patients survive early phases of sepsis (cytokine storm) and go on to develop long-lastingimmunoparalysis state that is characterized by the diminished ability to respond to secondary infections.

"Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryThe central objective of this Molecular Virology Viral Pathogenesis and Viral Vectors Training Grant is to trainstudents in virology so that they can become productive members of the research community. The importanceof virology has been highlighted by reports of the morbidity and mortality caused by viruses long known to infecthumans as well as the emergence of zoonotic virus infections. Thus there is an urgent need to continueproducing young scientists who are expert in virology. This training grant which has trained students for 20years consists of trainers with interests in a variety of viruses and who are both junior and senior. Our focus ison understanding fundamental aspects of human virology with an emphasis on emerging virus infections andviral pathogenesis and the development and use of viral vectors for gene delivery.Students who were appointed to the training grant in the past have uniformly completed their Ph.D.s and stayedin the life sciences. There are 18 trainers from several departments and interdisciplinary programs who serve asfaculty on this training grant. Their research interests range from the study of very basic processes in themolecular and cellular biology of virus replication to study of host immune responses to virus infection to studyof the most efficient mechanisms for gene delivery by viruses. The training grant program is rigorous andconsists of a mixture of didactic courses seminars seminar courses which emphasize critical reading of theliterature and data presentation and teaching opportunities. Trainees are provided feedback in several venuesto hone their presentation and laboratory skills. Its interdisciplinary nature promotes interaction among studentsand faculty interested in virology across the University of Iowa. By providing stipend support and travel fundsfor graduate students the training grant also facilitates exposure of our students to the national and internationalvirology community. Students selected for support by the training grant will have extra opportunities to teachclasses and to receive funding to attend an off-campus course in a cutting-edge technology such as bio-informatics. They will attend seminars at the University in which career options are discussed and will have theopportunity to interact with visiting virologists. Issues of scientific integrity and data reproducibility are alsoemphasized as part of the virology training grant. We also use the training grant as a mechanism for enhancingracial ethnic and socio-economic diversity as part of our selection process for trainees. In short this traininggrant has had many years of success and we will build upon this success. We continue to request funds for threepredoctoral graduate students per year with support generally provided for two years between their second andfourth years of study.","Molecular Virology;Training;Viral Pathogenesis;Viral Vector","Training in Molecular Virology Viral Pathogenesis and Viral Vectors","The major goal of the University of Iowa Virology Predoctoral Training Program is to produceoutstanding independent virologists who will pursue careers in academic or other virology-related careers.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences","PROJECT SUMMARY:Vertebrate photoreceptors are an elegant example of form being finely tuned to support function. Theseprimary sensory neurons are linearly organized into a series of morphologically and functionally distinctcompartments. All of the compartments contribute in different ways to the maintenance and signaling activity ofthis neuron. For instance photons are captured in the outer segment the synapse communicates that event todownstream neurons and the inner segment typically thought of as the housekeeping compartment housesthe ion channels pumps and transporters needed to set and maintain the circulating current that is ultimatelyused to communicate the presence or absence of light. The polarized trafficking of select ion channels to thedifferent photoreceptor compartments is well recognized as essential for the health and function of this cell.Yet the mechanisms controlling the subcellular trafficking and localization of ion channels in this cell or for thatmatter most others is poorly understood at best. The overarching goal of this project is to identify themechanisms that control polarized protein trafficking in photoreceptors. In this proposal we are building on theknowledge we gained in our earlier studies of HCN1 a hyperpolarization activated channel that filters lightresponses and is essential for vision in bright light. Aim 1 probes how the assembly status and permissivenessof HCN1 to leave the ER is coordinated. This aim also tests if the mechanisms controlling HCN1 processingare used to regulate Kv2.1/Kv8.2 a related ion channel also found within the inner segment that when absentresults in aberrant signaling and cone dystrophy. Aim 2 probes the function and mechanism of a secondtrafficking signal within HCN1 that we propose is required at least in part to recruit the protein coat needed forthe generation of HCN1-bearing transport vesicles. A suite of genetic biochemical imaging and physiologicaltools are used. Altogether this work will reveal fundamental mechanisms used in the polarized trafficking ofphotoreceptor proteins shed light on the contributions made by the early secretory pathway to the regulation ofion channels and is anticipated to transform current views of the fundamental organization of photoreceptorsin health and disease.","14-3-3 Family;Address;Afferent Neurons;Animal Model;Arginine;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biology;Blindness;Budgets;Capsid Proteins;Cell membrane;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular biology;Client;Complement;Complex;Cone;Cone dystrophy;Cultured Cells;Data;Defect;Disease;Disease Progression;Electrophysiology (science);Endoplasmic Reticulum;Event;Eye diseases;Feedback;Generations;Genetic;Goals;Golgi Apparatus;HCN1 channel;HCN1 gene;Health;Housekeeping;Image;In Vitro;Ion Channel;Ion Transport;Knowledge;Ligands;Light;Location;Maintenance;Measures;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Monitor;Morphology;Movement;Mutation;N-terminal;Neurons;Organelles;Output;Pathway interactions;Patients;Photons;Photoreceptors;Physiological;Physiology;Process;Proteins;Publishing;Pump;Regulation;Research;Retinal Diseases;Role;Series;Signal Transduction;Sorting - Cell Movement;Synapses;Testing;Vertebrate Photoreceptors;Vision;Visual;Work;base;combat;endoplasmic reticulum stress;expectation;in vivo;in vivo imaging;inherited retinal degeneration;light intensity;monomer;novel;permissiveness;polarized cell;prevent;protein distribution;protein transport;recruit;response;therapeutic development;tool;trafficking;vesicle transport;visual processing","Protein Targeting in Vertebrate Photoreceptors","PROJECT NARRATIVE:In this proposal we will investigate how the meticulously distinct distribution of proteins found inphotoreceptors is controlled.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences","The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlyingtransducin signaling in rod and cone photoreceptors. Although a remarkable level of understanding ofhow transducin functions in the phototransduction cascade has been achieved the mechanismsunderlying the folding of transducin- (Gt1) in rod photoreceptors (RPs) remains poorly understood.Defects in protein folding are a common cause of retinal degeneration and blindness; this underscoresthe need to investigate the folding mechanisms of key photoreceptor proteins including transducin.Evidence has emerged that the protein known as resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8 homolog A(Ric8A) is a chaperone of G-protein -subunits of the Gi/o family to which transducin belongs. Based onour finding that Ric8A is expressed in RPs we hypothesize that Ric8A is a chaperone for newlysynthesized and/or light-translocated Gt1. In order to elucidate the mechanism of Ric8A chaperoneactivity we will investigate the structure and properties of the complex between Gt1 and Ric8A. Thestructure of the Gt1-Ric8A complex in solution will be determined by small angle X-ray scattering(SAXS) using atomic models of Gt1 and Ric8A as a framework and distance constraints derived fromcross-linking experiments. In parallel X-ray crystallography will be used to determine high-resolutionstructures of Ric8A alone and in complex with Gt1. Structural information on the Gt1-Ric8A complexwill serve as a starting point for mutational and biochemical analyses of both the protein interface and thechaperone activity of Ric8A. We developed a mouse model in which Ric8A is knocked out specifically inRPs (Ric8AF/FCre+) and our preliminarily data support a role for Ric8A as a Gt1 chaperone. In parallelwith the structural studies we will investigate the functional significance of Ric8A in RPs by conductingcomprehensive examination of this mouse model. In addition we will examine the potential role of Ric8Aas a chaperone of Go in rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Elucidation of molecular details of Gt1 folding byRic8A is expected to have important implications for retinal diseases and to deepen our understanding ofthe G-protein chaperone machinery more generally. A second major focus of the proposed research ison the mechanisms whereby synaptic transmission between RPs and RBCs is modulated by light-translocated transducin. Based on our initial finding of Cav1.4 Ca2+ channel activation by transducin-(G11) in HEK293T cells we hypothesize that G11 modulates signaling at the RP-RBC synapse. Themechanisms underlying the modulation of RP output by G11 will be investigated in biochemical andelectrophysiological experiments using in vitro and in vivo approaches. The proposed analysis ofsynapse modulation by transducin is expected to cause a profound paradigm shift expanding the role oftransducin from the generation of visual signals to the modulation of the RP output.","Affect;Biochemical;Biology;Blindness;Cells;Cholinesterase Inhibitors;Complex;Data;Defect;Electrophysiology (science);Enzymes;Family;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits;GTP-Binding Proteins;Generations;Glean;Goals;Homologous Gene;Human;In Vitro;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Light;Mediating;Medical;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Morphology;Mutation Analysis;Nature;Outcome Study;Output;Photoreceptors;Phototransduction;Point Mutation;Property;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Resolution;Retina;Retinal Cone;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Diseases;Rhodopsin;Rod;Roentgen Rays;Role;SNAP receptor;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;System;Testing;Transducin;Vision Disorders;Visual;X-Ray Crystallography;alpha Subunit Transducin;base;chaperone machinery;crosslink;experimental study;in vivo;insight;mouse model;phosphodiesterase 6;photoreceptor degeneration;presynaptic;programs;protein folding;response;retinal rods;transmission process","Molecular Mechanism of Photoreceptor G Protein Signaling","Transducin is the key molecule in the transfer of visual signals in the vertebrate rod and conephotoreceptors.

"No NIH Category available","AbstractBackground: The long-term objective of the Povidone-iodine to stop Access related INfections andTransmission of Staphylococcus aureus (PAINTS) proposal is to decrease rates of healthcare-associated infections that occur outside of the hospital (i.e. community-onset infections). Recent datafrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) demonstrated that 83% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections are community-onset. Hemodialysispatients are at high-risk for community-onset bloodstream infections particularly S. aureus access-related bloodstream infections (ARBSI). These infections cause increased morbidity and mortality.Nasal povidone-iodine decolonization is a novel intervention that can potentially prevent S. aureusARBSI in this patient population. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess whether nasal povidone-iodinedecolonization reduces infections among hemodialysis patients using a multicenter stepped-wedgecluster randomized trial. Primary outcome: S. aureus ARBSI. Secondary outcomes: Other S. aureusdialysis-associated infections as defined by the CDC National Healthcare Safety Network ARBSIcaused by pathogens other than S. aureus all dialysis-associated infections caused by all pathogensand S. aureus colonization and transmission. Aim 2: Evaluate patient satisfaction with nasal povidone-iodine decolonization assess its role in patient activation and assess barriers and facilitators toimplementation using patient surveys. Aim 3: Examine healthcare worker satisfaction withimplementation of nasal povidone-iodine decolonization and assess barriers and facilitators to theprocess via qualitative interviews and site visits. Research Design: We aim to perform a randomizedstepped wedge study among 16 hemodialysis units affiliated with 5 geographically diverse healthcarecenters to evaluate whether nasal povidone-iodine will reduce rates of S. aureus ARBSI amonghemodialysis patients. These hemodialysis units represent both rural and inner-city patients whoreceive chronic care (AHRQ priority populations). We will survey all patients and qualitatively interviewhealthcare workers to assess the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention as well as barriers andfacilitators to implementation. We will test patients' noses for S. aureus colonization to determinewhether nasal povidone-iodine decreases S. aureus colonization and S. aureus transmission. The sitesthat will participate in this study (University of Iowa University of Illinois University of PennsylvaniaWashington University Emory Healthcare) have a good history of collaboration. Relevance: This studywill help AHRQ address its goal to build the evidence for fighting antibiotic resistance in the ambulatorysetting and help meet the National Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infectionsrecommendation that hemodialysis centers aim to improve ARBSI rates."," ","Povidone-iodine to Stop Access-related Infections and Transmission of Staphylococcus aureus (PAINTS)","Project NarrativeHemodialysis patients are at high-risk for infections specifically Staphylococcus aureus infections.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia & Influenza; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACTInfluenza A viruses pose a serious threat to human health causing seasonal epidemics and occasionalpandemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The virulence and pathogenic nature ofinfluenza virus strains vary greatly and is often determined by the constellation of viral genes. While seasonalinfluenza viruses cause a mild upper respiratory infection in healthy individuals highly pathogenic avianinfluenza viruses (HPAIV) of the H5N1 subtype replicate in the lower respiratory tract causing fatal viralpneumonia characterized by pulmonary edema and vascular leakage. In addition H5N1 infections areassociated with an uncontrolled activation of host immune responses which contributes to the severity ofdisease. The role of viral and host factors in the enhanced virulence and pulmonary immunopathologycharacteristic of HPAIV infections remain unknown. To this end we engineered H5N1 viruses with restrictedtropism through the incorporation of microRNA (miRNA) target sites into the viral genome. Specifically wegenerated an H5N1 virus carrying endothelial cell specific miR-126 target sites (H5N1-126T) such that viralreplication was abrogated in endothelial cells without impeding replication in other cell types. In our recentstudies H5N1-126T infected mice and ferrets showed significantly reduced virulence and vascular leakage inthe lungs as compared to the control H5N1-ScrbT virus infected group despite similar viral loads in the lungsof mice and nasal washes of ferrets. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the importance ofendothelial cell tropism to H5N1 pathogenesis. The current proposal will (1) determine the consequence ofendothelial cell infection to barrier integrity and function (2) investigate the role of endothelial cell tropism inorchestrating immune responses and (3) assess the contribution of viral tropism to the pathogenesis of otherhighly virulent strains including H7N7 1918 H1N1 and H7N9 in mice and ferrets. The knowledge gained fromthese studies will help to elucidate the mechanism by which virulent influenza viruses cause severe diseaseand aid in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against virulent influenza strains. Furthermorethese studies will reveal how viral tropism modulates host antiviral responses and will pave the way for therational design of novel live attenuated vaccines with restricted tropism.","Adult;Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome;Antiviral Response;Attenuated Vaccines;Avian Influenza A Virus;Biological Models;Blood Vessels;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cells;Characteristics;Coculture Techniques;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Down-Regulation;Elderly;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Engineering;Epidemic;Epithelial Cells;Extravasation;Ferrets;Generations;Goals;Health;Hematopoietic;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunocompromised Host;Individual;Infection;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Influenza A Virus H1N1 Subtype;Influenza A Virus H5N1 Subtype;Influenza A Virus H7N7 Subtype;Influenza A Virus H7N9 Subtype;Influenza A virus;Injury;Innate Immune Response;Integration Host Factors;Knowledge;Link;Lower respiratory tract structure;Lung;Mediating;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Nature;Neutrophil Infiltration;Nose;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Positioning Attribute;Predisposition;Production;Pulmonary Edema;Reporter;Reporting;Research Personnel;Role;Severity of illness;Site;Survival Rate;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic;Transgenic Organisms;Tropism;Upper Respiratory Infections;Vascular Permeabilities;Viral;Viral Genes;Viral Genome;Viral Load result;Viral Pathogenesis;Viral Pneumonia;Virulence;Virulent;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;Vulnerable Populations;age group;burden of illness;cell type;cytokine;design;experimental study;immunopathology;improved;in vivo;influenza infection;influenza virus strain;influenzavirus;lung injury;member;monocyte;mortality;mouse model;neutrophil;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;pandemic disease;pathogen;prevent;recombinant virus;recruit;seasonal influenza;tissue tropism;tool","Endothelial cell tropism in the pathogenesis and host response against influenza viruses - Resubmission 01","NARRATIVEInfections with seasonal influenza virus cause severe disease in vulnerable populations including the youngelderly and immunocompromised yet are generally self limiting in healthy individuals.

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Dissemination and Implementation Research; Health Disparities; Health Services; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health; Women's Health","PROJECT SUMMARYThere is growing evidence that limited access to high-quality cancer treatment is one of the main drivers ofhigher cancer mortality rates among rural cancer patients. Our analyses of Iowa Cancer Registry data indicatethat 40% of rural patients with breast and colorectal cancers receive most or all definitive treatment in ruralhospitals that do not collect or monitor data on their quality of cancer care and are not accredited by theAmerican College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC). Our data also shows these patients are lesslikely to receive guideline-concordant care. Given patients' needs and preferences to receive cancer carelocally a promising strategy to improve quality of cancer care and outcomes in rural populations is to intervenedirectly with the community hospitals in these areas. New evidence has demonstrated effectiveness of thisapproach: the Markey Cancer Center Affiliate Network (MCCAN) was formed by the University of Kentucky(UK) Markey Cancer Center to improve quality of cancer care in their own rural low-resourced state one thatleads the nation in cancer incidence and mortality. Over the last decade MCCAN has facilitated the sharingand diffusion of resources and best practices throughout their network. As a result affiliates markedlyimproved performance on established cancer care quality measures and expanded their services (e.g.psychosocial and survivorship support). They were also almost 3 times more likely to obtain CoC accreditationthan their matched controls. However the MCCAN model has not been rigorously defined evaluated or testedin any other setting. We propose to adapt this successful health system-level intervention for Iowa establishingthe Iowa Cancer Affiliate Network (I-CAN). Although there are similarities between Iowa and Kentucky'spopulations that suggest the MCCAN model may be a good fit there are also significant differences inhealthcare infrastructure and resources that require careful adaptation of the intervention prior to itsimplementation in order to retain its effectiveness. We will use novel rigorously developed theory-basedimplementation science methods to identify MCCAN's core functions (i.e. what makes it effective) study theimplementation process and evaluate how I-CAN performs in a new context. We have identified 4 rural Iowahospitals to participate in this intervention trial and developed expert support teams to assist key stakeholdergroups within each hospital. Through interviews and qualitative analyses we will assess determinants andoutcomes of the implementation process and perceived value of the CoC accreditation standards and theintervention itself as a way to improve the quality of cancer care for their patients. We will compare compliancewith treatment-related quality measures and the proportion of CoC standards of cancer care implemented intarget and control hospitals pre- and post-intervention using a difference-in-difference estimator. This workcould lead to dissemination of similar models across rural settings thereby improving quality of care reducingrural disparities in cancer outcomes and giving rural hospitals an avenue to demonstrate their quality of care.","Accreditation;Address;Adopted;Adoption;American College of Surgeons;Area;Breast;Breast-Conserving Surgery;Cancer Center;Cancer Death Rates;Cancer Patient;Caring;Colon Carcinoma;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Community Hospitals;Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research;Data;Data Collection;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Effectiveness;Familiarity;Goals;Guidelines;Health system;Healthcare;Home;Hospitals;Incidence;Infrastructure;Intervention;Intervention Trial;Interview;Iowa;Kentucky;Lead;Logistics;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Needs Assessment;Outcome;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Physicians;Population;Quality of Care;Radiation therapy;Readiness;Research;Resected;Resource Sharing;Resources;Risk;Rural;Rural Hospitals;Rural Population;Services;Social support;Specialist;Specific qualifier value;Structure;Testing;Time;Transportation;United States;Universities;Urban Population;Woman;Work;adaptation algorithm;base;breast cancer diagnosis;cancer care;cancer health disparity;cancer therapy;cancer type;care outcomes;cost;data registry;draining lymph node;evidence base;implementation determinants;implementation outcomes;implementation process;implementation science;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;mortality;multidisciplinary;neoplasm registry;network models;novel;post intervention;preference;preservation;programs;psychosocial;rural area;rural cancer care;rural disparities;rural dwellers;rural patients;rural setting;rural underserved;survival outcome;survivorship;theories;tool;treatment guidelines;treatment planning","Effectiveness and implementation of a health system intervention to improve quality of cancer care for rural underserved patients","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe 60 million rural residents of the United States have a lower rate of new cases of cancer per year comparedto urban residents but have a higher rate of cancer deaths per year partly due to the greater difficulty inaccessing high-quality cancer treatment in rural areas.

"Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY A major obstacle in the development of mold-active antifungals is limited methodologies for highthroughput screening with molds. Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium spp. are two common molds that causeinvasive infections in immune-compromised patients. Despite current antifungal treatments limited to only threeunique classes of drugs mortality rates of these infections are devastatingly high. In addition to the serioushealth threat molds pose to immune-compromised patients molds cause infections in immune-competentindividuals particularly in the form of corneal infections or fungal keratitis. Fungal keratitis is a leading cause ofmonocular blindness worldwide and only about half of patients with corneal infections caused by Aspergillus orFusarium respond to treatment. The current state of fungal infections worldwide combined with emergingresistance to current antifungal drugs calls for novel classes of mold-active antifungals to combat these life-threatening infections. This proposal aims to fill a technical gap in the field by applying the adenylate kinase assay to filamentousfungi to perform high throughput screening. The adenylate kinase assay has been validated and successfullyused for high throughput screening with yeast and bacteria and possesses several qualities that make it anexcellent candidate for application to molds. We have shown that this assay reliably detects lysis of A. fumigatusand optimized conditions suitable for high throughput screening. In this proposal our goal is to adapt this assayto Fusarium oxysporum then perform screens with Aspergillus and Fusarium with multiple small molecule andnatural product libraries. In addition to screening against wild type A. fumigatus we will perform a repurposingscreen of FDA-approved drugs using a strain harboring a common voriconazole resistance mechanism. In thisway we hope to identify novel classes of mold-active antifungal drugs as well as drugs to be repurposed andexpedited to clinical use to treat fungal infections.","Affect;Antifungal Agents;Antifungal Therapy;Aspergillus;Aspergillus fumigatus;Automobile Driving;Bacteria;Biological Assay;Biomass;Candida albicans;Caspofungin;Cells;Clinical;Cornea;Cytolysis;Data;Detection;Development;Disease;Dose;Drug Screening;Drug resistance;Drug usage;Enzymes;Eye Injuries;FDA approved;Fellowship;Foundations;Fusarium;Germination;Goals;Growth;Health;Hyphae;Immune;Immunocompetent;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Keratitis;Libraries;Life;Light;Lytic;Measurement;Medical Technology;Methodology;Methods;Molds;Monocular Blindness;Mutation;Mycoses;Natural Products;Operative Surgical Procedures;Optics;Organism;Outcome;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Publishing;Reproducibility;Research Personnel;Resistance;Risk;Signal Transduction;Technology;Voriconazole;Yeasts;adenylate kinase;antimicrobial;base;career;cohort;combat;density;drug development;experience;high throughput screening;immune function;infection rate;luciferin;mortality;novel;novel drug class;novel therapeutics;promoter;resazurin;resistance mechanism;scaffold;screening;small molecule","Development of a high throughput-compatible assay for screening filamentous fungi","PROJECT NARRATIVEIn immune-compromised individuals life threatening invasive disease caused by molds are hard to treat andoften result in mortality.

"Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACTNeutrophilic dermatosis is a spectrum of skin disorders that include several rare diseases such as Sweetssyndrome pyoderma gangrenosum and subcorneal pustular dermatosis [1]. The treatment options for these rarediseases hallmarked by skin lesions filled with neutrophils are limited to the use of strong immunosuppressivewhich are non-specific and have adverse side effects. Thus specific novel therapeutic targets are much neededto help patients suffering from these disorders. Mice carrying a single point mutation in the Ptpn6 gene thatresults in a Y208N substitution in the Ptpn6 encoded SHP1 protein (known as Ptpn6spin mice) developspontaneous footpad inflammation that mimics neutrophilic dermatosis. We have extensively studied Ptpn6spinmice and identified several novel therapeutic targets including IL-1 alpha RIPK1 SYK and TAK1 that can bepotentially beneficial to neutrophilic dermatosis patients [2]. Building upon these prior discoveries we have setour goals to elucidate the role of an integrin-associated protein CD47 and its crosstalk with SHP1 in regulatingautoinflammatory disease and health. CD47 is ubiquitously expressed in the human body and provides a donteat me signal to the phagocytic cells [3 4]. Our preliminary data show a crucial role for CD47 in regulatingdisease observed in Ptpn6spin mice; however the cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unknown.Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of these pathologies will not only enhance our generalunderstanding of CD47 and SHP1 biology but also aid in the development of potential novel therapies forinflammation and cancer.","Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Binding;Biochemical;Biology;CASP3 gene;CD47 gene;Cell Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Chimera organism;Clinical Trials;Data;Development;Disease;Eating;Embryo;Etiology;Genes;Genetic Crosses;Goals;Health;Human;Human body;Hyperactivity;Immune;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Integrins;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 alpha;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;MAP3K7 gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;NR0B2 gene;Outcome;PTPN6 gene;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phagocytes;Pharmacotherapy;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Play;Point Mutation;Pregnancy;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase;Proteins;Pyoderma Gangrenosum;RIPK1 gene;Rare Diseases;Research;Role;SYK gene;Signal Transduction;Skin;Subcorneal Pustular Dermatosis;Sweet&apos;s Syndrome;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic;autoinflammation;autoinflammatory;base;cancer therapy;design;insight;mouse model;neutrophil;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;pup;radioresistant;rare condition;side effect;skin disorder;skin lesion;treatment strategy","Elucidating CD47-SHP1 biology to understand autoinflammatory disorders","PROJECT NARRATIVENeutrophilic dermatosis includes a spectrum of rare disorders such as Sweets syndrome subcorneal pustulardermatosis and pyoderma gangrenosum where skin lesions of the patients are replete with neutrophils.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Neurosciences; Substance Misuse","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTIn the United States alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects ~15% of adults with the prevalence of binge drinkingon the rise in adolescents and young adults. AUD represents a major issue to healthcare given that chronicexcessive alcohol consumption in humans is associated with cardiovascular disease metabolic syndrome andcancer while acute alcohol intoxication can prove lethal. Economically AUD represents a massive burden dueto loss of productivity and associated healthcare costs. Recently the endocrine hormone fibroblast growthfactor 21 (FGF21) known for its potent metabolic effects was found to significantly reduce alcoholconsumption via signaling through its obligate co-receptor -klotho in the brain. Importantly single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) in both the FGF21 and -klotho genomic loci are highly associated with increasedalcohol consumption in humans. Our preliminary data demonstrates that FGF21 treatment markedlysuppresses alcohol consumption in mice previous subjected to chronic alcohol exposure. Furthermoreexcessive alcohol consumption promotes FGF21 secretion from the liver representing a homeostatic feedbackloop to regulate alcohol consumption. However the mechanism of FGF21 action in the brain and the neuronaltarget(s) for these effects has not been determined. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the neuralcircuit(s) regulating FGF21-mediated suppression of alcohol intake. The aims of this grant are to 1) determinethe direct neuronal target(s) of FGF21 in the CNS mediating inhibition of alcohol intake and 2) determine howFGF21 modulates reward circuits to regulate alcohol intake and preference. To accomplish these aims wehave generated novel animal models and tools to examine these experimental aims. These studies will providenew fundamental insights into the regulation of alcohol intake by peripheral endocrine signals acting on thecentral nervous system. In addition these studies may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment ofAUD.","Acute;Address;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Affect;Alcohol consumption;Alcoholic Intoxication;Alcohols;Amygdaloid structure;Animal Model;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cells;Chronic;Consummatory Behavior;Consumption;Data;Diagnosis;Dissection;Dopamine;Drug usage;Economic Burden;Endocrine;Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase;Ethanol;Etiology;Feedback;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Variation;Glutamates;Goals;Grant;Health Care Costs;Healthcare;Heavy Drinking;Hormonal;Hormones;Human;Individual;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Liver;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Modeling;Mus;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;Neuraxis;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacology;Physiological;Physiology;Population;Prevalence;Production;Regulation;Rewards;Role;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Synaptic Transmission;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;United States;Ventral Tegmental Area;Work;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol exposure;alcohol use disorder;base;binge drinking;cancer risk;designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs;fibroblast growth factor 21;genomic locus;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;mesolimbic system;mouse model;neural circuit;new therapeutic target;novel;preference;prevent;productivity loss;promoter;receptor;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tool","Endocrine Regulation of Alcohol Intake","PROJECT NARRATIVEAccording to the NIAAA in the United States roughly 6% of adults have alcohol use disorder and almost 27%of adults have engaged in binge-drinking in the last month suggesting there is a serious demand for therapiesto prevent excessive alcohol consumption.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Genetics; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Pediatric Cancer; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Human","PROJECT SUMMARYEwing sarcoma is a highly aggressive bone and soft tissue cancer that is caused by the EWS-FLI1 fusionprotein. The EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein functions in part as an aberrant transcription factor and is required fortumor growth and survival. However directly targeting EWS-FLI1 with drugs has been challenging and as aresult there is a critical need to identify downstream targets of EWS-FLI1 and unique vulnerabilities incurredby the oncoprotein. In order to identify downstream targets of EWS-FLI1 we used human embryonic stem cellsthat express inducible EWS-FLI1 to model the initiation and development of Ewing sarcoma in a geneticallydefined system. We then used this model system and a gene expression based approach to identify that Ewingsarcoma cells are uniquely vulnerable to inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) including gemcitabinewhich impair DNA replication by blocking the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. Moreover we have alsoidentified that the inhibition of RNR in Ewing sarcoma cells results replication stress activation of the unfoldedprotein response and a block in the synthesis of proteins required for the response to impaired DNAreplication. Notably the combination of gemcitabine with an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) the majorregulator of the response to impaired DNA replication results in synergy in vitro and a significant prolongationof mouse survival in xenograft experiments. Guided by strong preliminary data we will now pursue thefollowing specific aims: 1) dissect the molecular basis of the activation and regulation of the unfolded proteinresponse in Ewing sarcoma cells treated with inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase; 2) test the in vivo efficacyof gemcitabine and a second-generation CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib using Ewing sarcoma xenograft models;and 3) use high-throughput screening to test candidate therapeutics identified using our gene expressionbased approach for activity against Ewing sarcoma cells. These aims will be tested using a combination ofapproaches in cancer cell lines cell line xenografts patient-derived xenografts and our isogenic geneticallydefined cell lines. This work will be significant because it is expected to have translational relevance for thetreatment of children and adults with Ewing sarcoma tumors as well as lead to a broader understanding of thebasic mechanisms of tumorigenesis in Ewing sarcoma tumors. The proposed research is innovative because itintegrates a novel stem cell model of Ewing sarcoma with a gene expression signature based screeningapproach to identify new therapeutic targets.","Adolescent;Adult;Biological Models;Bone Tissue;CHEK1 gene;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cell model;Cells;Child;Chromosomal translocation;Clinical Data;Clinical Trials;Cytotoxic Chemotherapy;DNA Damage;DNA biosynthesis;Data;Deoxyribonucleotides;Development;Disease;Drug Screening;EWS-FLI1 fusion protein;EWSR1 gene;Ewings sarcoma;FDA approved;FLI1 gene;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Fusion;Generations;Genetic;Goals;Immune checkpoint inhibitor;Impairment;In Vitro;Laboratories;Lead;Libraries;Malignant Childhood Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Mediator of activation protein;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Mus;Network-based;Oncogenes;Oncoproteins;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Radiation;Regulation;Research;Resources;Ribonucleotide Reductase;Ribonucleotide Reductase Inhibitor;Role;Soft tissue sarcoma;System;Testing;Toxic effect;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;bone;chemotherapy;clinical translation;cytotoxic;drug candidate;drug sensitivity;early phase clinical trial;experimental study;gemcitabine;high throughput screening;human disease;human embryonic stem cell;in vivo;in vivo evaluation;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;mouse model;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;patient derived xenograft model;pre-clinical;replication stress;response;screening;soft tissue;stem cell model;subcutaneous;synergism;targeted treatment;therapeutic candidate;therapeutic target;transcription factor;tumor;tumor growth;tumor initiation;tumor progression;tumorigenesis","Gene expression signature based screening in Ewing sarcoma","PROJECT NARRATIVEEwing sarcoma is an aggressive cancer in children adolescents and adults that is treated with chemotherapyand surgery and/or radiation.

"Cardiovascular; Contraception/Reproduction; Hypertension; Maternal Health; Maternal Morbidity and Mortality; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Pregnancy; Prevention; Women's Health","Preeclampsia (PreE) is a prevalent hypertensive disorder in pregnancy and is a leading cause of worldwideobstetric mortality with 76000 maternal and 500000 neonatal deaths yearly. Due to the unclear earlypregnancy etiology of PreE prevention of PreE is limited to daily baby aspirin which may only modestlyprevent PreE. A polymorphism in the gene encoding Regulator of G-Protein Signaling (RGS)-2 is associatedwith an increased risk for preeclampsia. RGS2 is a member of the B/R4 family of RGS proteins which acts asan endogenous inhibitor of Gq-calcium second-messenger signaling a common pathogenic pathway formany PreE related hormones such as arginine vasopressin (AVP). Betamethasone (BTMZ) is commonly givento women at risk of preterm delivery to prevent neonatal morbidities. Our preliminary data and the literaturesuggest that steroids like BMTZ can induce RGS2 thereby turning off the excessive pathogenic Gq-calciumsignaling seen in PreE. Together these data lead us to the overall hypothesis that BMTZ prevents PreE byrestoring placental RGS2 signaling and decreasing the excessive Gq-calcium signaling that has beenassociated with PreE related placental dysfunction. The overall objectives of the current proposal are (i) toevaluate the impact excessive Gq signaling upon placental trophoblast function and preeclampsiaphenotypes and (ii) demonstrate that BMTZ increases RGS2 activity leading to decreased Gq-calciumsignaling thereby preventing PreE. Aim 1 will examine the role of excess placental Gq signaling on placentaldysfunction and PreE in a placental specific hm3Dq (Gq-activating) DREDD receptor mouse model.Consistent with this we will test that reduced RGS2 results in PreE through the excessive Gq signaling in afeto-placental RGS2 reduction mouse model (WT dams X RGS2-KO males). In isolated total trophoblasts fromthese mouse models and in primary human preeclamptic placental tissues we will study if increased calciumrelease leads to the poor trophoblast migration consistent with PreE. Aim 2 will test our hypothesis that theobserved reduction in RGS2 in PreE is due to reduced trophoblast cAMP-CREB signaling as will be tested in(AVP)-induced HTR-8/svNeo cells and primary human trophoblasts from PreE pregnancies. We will examine ifthis reduction in cAMP-CREB-RGS2 signaling will be reversed by treatment with BMTZ in i) AVP-inducedHTR-8/svNeo cells ii) primary human trophoblasts clinically exposed to BMTZ and iii) in our chronic infusion ofvasopressin (CIV) mouse model of PreE. Together these studies will greatly clarify a potential causal role ofRGS2 in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia physiological mechanisms controlling RGS2 expression inplacental trophoblasts and the possible novel use of BMTZ in the prevention of preeclampsia.","Address;Adenylate Cyclase;Affect;Angiotensins;Antihypertensive Agents;Argipressin;Aspirin;Betamethasone;CREB1 gene;Calcium;Calcium Signaling;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Cyclic AMP;Data;Development;Dexamethasone;Discipline of obstetrics;Disease;Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry;Endothelin-1;Etiology;Exposure to;Family;Family member;Functional disorder;Future;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;GTP-Binding Protein Regulators;GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits Gs;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;Hormones;Human;Immunologics;Infusion procedures;Lead;Link;Literature;Magnesium;Metabolic;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiological;Placenta;Pre-Eclampsia;Pregnancy;Premature Birth;Prevention;Process;RGS Proteins;RGS2 gene;Risk;Role;Second Messenger Systems;Seizures;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Steroids;Testing;Tissues;Vasopressins;Woman;Work;antenatal;base;cell type;early pregnancy;fetal;inhibitor/antagonist;mRNA Expression;male;member;migration;mortality;mouse model;neonatal death;neonatal morbidity;novel;pre-clinical;prevent;protein expression;receptor;trophoblast","Vasopressin and Preeclampsia: Early Mechanisms for Prevention","We have demonstrated the AVP pathway is a novel robust and early predictor of the development of humanpreeclampsia and that AVP replicates human preeclampsia in mice.

"Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human","ABSTRACT TEXT: Approximately 5.7 million adult Americans have heart failure and this prevalence isprojected to increase 25% by 2030. Despite improvement in heart failure treatment including device therapyand cardiac transplantation the mortality rate remains high. Cardiac arrhythmia is among the most commoncause of mortality in heart failure patients. We and others have demonstrated the roles of mitochondrialdysfunction in heart failure due to various etiologies. Among these mitochondrial cardiomyopathydemonstrates the most severe impairment of mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial disease is a group of raregenetic disorder due to mutation of mitochondrial proteins most encoded by nuclear DNA and a few bymitochondrial DNA. Although only approximately 40% of patients with mitochondrial disease exhibit cardiacinvolvement the presence of cardiomyopathy significantly predicts poor outcome and to date there is noeffective therapy. Novel therapeutics is urgently needed to treat such patients. This study proposesmanipulation of energy sensor signaling to enhance mitochondrial function in order to treat mitochondrialdisease focusing on mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. Our preliminary data and previous publications suggestthat energy sensor signaling including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide (NAD+) play an important role to maintain mitochondrial function in mitochondrial disease as wellas during development of heart failure. This study proposes strategies of manipulating energy sensor signaling(AMPK NAD+ sirtuin) to improve mitochondrial function and to rescue cardiac arrhythmia in a mouse model ofcomplex I deficiency with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (Aim 1). To better recapitulate human disease Ipropose to model human mitochondrial cardiomyopathy on a dish using human induced pluripotent cellderived cardiomyocytes with mitochondrial complex I deficiency (Aim 2) and use the same strategies to rescuearrhythmia and cardiomyocyte dysfunction. The training award provides an excellent opportunity to learn noveltechnology of iPS gene editing (such as CRISPR/cas) measurement of biomechanics and electrophysiologyof cardiomyocytes as functional parameter of disease in a dish and extend my training in mitochondrialbiology. This proposal is significant because it advances our scientific understanding of the relationship ofmitochondrial dysfunction and heart failure and arrhythmia and test the method to rescue mitochondrialdisease. Completion of this study may lead to development of novel therapy for untreatable mitochondrialdisease. Finally since mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in various etiologies of end-stage heart failure themitochondrial protective strategies proposed in this study may also be beneficial in other types of heartdiseases.","5&apos;-AMP-activated protein kinase;ATP2A2;Acetylation;Adult;American;Arrhythmia;Award;Biochemical;Bioenergetics;Biogenesis;Biology;Biomechanics;Bradycardia;Calcium;Calcium Channel;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiomyopathies;Cells;Clinical;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complex;Cytochrome c Reductase;DNA;Data;Deacetylase;Deacetylation;Development;Devices;Dilated Cardiomyopathy;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Economic Burden;Electrophysiology (science);Etiology;Exhibits;Failure;Functional disorder;Genes;Goals;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Transplantation;Heart failure;High Prevalence;Human;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy;Impairment;Intervention;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Lead;Learning;Left ventricular non-compaction;Link;Measurement;Mechanics;Mediating;Metabolic;Methods;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial DNA;Mitochondrial Diseases;Mitochondrial Proteins;Mitochondrial complex I deficiency;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Myocardial dysfunction;NADH;NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone);Nerve Degeneration;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;Nodal;Nuclear;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Pacemakers;Patients;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Post-Translational Regulation;Prevalence;Property;Protein Kinase;Proteins;Proteomics;Publications;Relaxation;Role;SIRT1 gene;Signal Transduction;Sirtuins;Societies;Sodium Channel;Testing;Text;Training;Treatment Failure;cardiogenesis;design;disease-in-a-dish;effective therapy;human disease;human model;improved;induced pluripotent stem cell;insight;mitochondrial dysfunction;mortality;mouse model;mutant;new technology;new therapeutic target;nicotinamide riboside supplementation;nicotinamide-beta-riboside;novel therapeutics;overexpression;prevent;rare genetic disorder;sensor;sudden cardiac death","The role of energy sensor signaling in mitochondrial cardiomyopathy","NARRATIVE: Heart failure is prevalent and imposes huge economic burden to our society.

"Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome","PROJECT SUMMARYCutaneous melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer. In the US alone approximately 90000 new casesand 9000 deaths due to melanoma were reported in 2017. Selective inhibitors of BRAFV600E/K work potentlyagainst melanomas driven by oncogenic BRAF. Unfortunately drug resistance is ubiquitous and most patientswill progress within two years of therapy. Large-scale genome- and transcriptome- profiling reveal that resistanceto MAPK inhibition (MAPKi) is either MAPK- dependent or redundant. MAPK-dependent (resistance ~50%)resistance is characterized by the reactivation of MAPK typically through mutations that augment MAPKsignaling. These MAPKi-resistant melanomas are nearly identical at the transcriptome level to their respectiveparental cancers which further support these cancers simply restore MAPK. By contrast MAPK-redundantresistance (remaining 50%) is characterized by extensive transcriptional reprogramming and is often devoid ofrecurrent mutations. Mechanistically MAPK-dependent resistance is centered on the formation of Raf homo- orheter- dimers that are resistant to current generation Raf inhibitors but sensitive to next-generation Raf inhibitorsthat have dimer activity. However MAPK-redundant resistance is not uniform not well-understood and lacks acommon therapeutic target. This knowledge is important as there are no current treatment options formelanomas with MAPK-redundant resistance. To address this critical gap we performed a forward genetic screen to identify novel mechanisms thatdrive resistance to MAPKi. This screen was performed using our well-established Sleeping Beauty Transposonsystem. The outcome of this screen was that SFKs and PDGFR were the preferred MAPK-redundantmechanisms of resistance for BRAFV600E melanomas A375 and SKMEL28. However the precise mechanisms bywhich SFKs and PDGFR drive MAPK-redundant resistance are unknown. In Aim 1 I will elucidate themechanism of SFKs- and PDGFR- driven resistance to MAPKi by testing the hypothesis that actin remodelingis central to MAPKi resistance that is driven by both SFKs or PDGFR and that integrins are critical upstream ofthe SFKs resistance program and Akt is a critical downstream meditator of the PDGFR resistance program. InAim 2 I will test the hypothesis that SFKs and PDGFR promotes MAPKi resistance by activating theYap/Taz/TEAD/AP-1 transcriptional complex. The central hypothesis is that actin remodeling and theYAP/TAZ/AP-1 complex are critical mediators of the SFKs- and PDGFR- resistance programs.","Actins;Address;BRAF gene;Biochemistry;Caring;Cell Line;Cells;Cessation of life;ChIP-seq;Complex;Cutaneous Melanoma;Drug resistance;Gene Expression Profile;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Growth;Homo;Individual;Integrins;Knowledge;MAP Kinase Gene;MAP Kinase Modules;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediator of activation protein;Medical Oncologist;Melanoma Cell;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Mutation;Oncogenic;Outcome;PDGFRB gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Protein Family;Proteins;Recurrence;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Skin Cancer;Sleeping Beauty;System;Testing;Transcription Factor AP-1;Work;activating transcription factor;base;dimer;drug development;effective therapy;genetic manipulation;genome-wide;improved;in vitro Assay;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;melanoma;member;mutant;next generation;novel;programs;raf Kinases;resistance mechanism;therapeutic target;therapy development;transcriptional reprogramming;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;treatment strategy","Drivers of MAPK-redundant resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma","PROJECT NARRATIVETargeted inhibition of mutant Raf works potently against melanoma by inhibiting an oncogenic protein thatdrives melanoma growth.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Physical Activity; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTThe University of California Preclinical Animal Study Site (UC PASS) is a collaborative effort between UCDavis and UC San Diego that brings together the scientific expertise state of the art technologies and facilitiesand institutional support to achieve the primary objectives goals of the PASS which are to: 1) develop animalmodels that best complement the endurance and resistance training protocols used in the human trials and 2)provide organ and tissue samples collected at multiple time points after both acute and chronic exercise foranalysis by the Chemical Analysis Sites. The animal studies to be undertaken by the PASS will begin toelucidate the molecular pathways responsible for the acute and chronic effects of both endurance andresistance exercise on individual organs as well as identify the interactions between organs; the goal being tounderstand the mechanisms by which different modes of physical activity impart their health benefits. In orderto reach this goal experts in model development and phenotyping of the resulting muscle and global healthadaptations will be essential. The UC PASS team has exactly these traits. The team acknowledges that theultimate animal model and exercise tests to be utilized in the PASS will be determined by the MolecularTransducers of Physical Activity Common (MoTrPAC) Steering Committee. In this application we provide astrong rationale and justification for the use of the rat as the animal model and propose specific endurance andresistance exercise programs to be used in Phase I of the PASS highlighting the major advantages andlimitations of each paradigm. In Phase II of the PASS we build on the models established in Phase I andpropose three specific aims to begin to produce a standard curve of molecular transducers versus adaptiveresponse to exercise. In Phase II we propose to exercise animals of increasing age or increasing adipositydetermine the adaptive response to 12 weeks of training and relate this with the acute molecular transducerresponse to exercise. With this secondary screen we will be able to identify molecular transducers that directlycorrelate with the local or global health benefits of exercise. We will then use this information to test the geneticrequirement for these molecular transducers for the health benefits of exercise. The UC PASS is composed ofan exceptional team of primary investigators and key collaborators/advisors with expertise in the developmentof animal models of exercise the molecular response to exercise and applied human exercise interventions.This team will provide leadership and the necessary skill sets to successfully model human exercise inanimals which is essential to the success of the MoTrPAC Common Fund and achievement of its goal: todefine and understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the human health benefits of physical activity.","Achievement;Acute;Aerobic Exercise;Age;Americas;Animal Experiments;Animal Model;Animals;Body Composition;California;Chemicals;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical Trials;Collection;Complement;Data Analyses;Development;Discipline;Disease;Dose;Environment;Epigenetic Process;Evolution;Exercise;Exercise Physiology;Exercise Test;Funding;Future;Genetic;Goals;Health;Health Benefit;Human;Indirect Calorimetry;Individual;Insulin;Knowledge;Leadership;Longevity;Maintenance;Maps;Measurement;Metabolic;Metabolism;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Target;Morbidity - disease rate;Muscle;Muscle function;Obesity;Organ;Pathway interactions;Phase;Phenotype;Physical Fitness;Physical activity;Physiological;Physiological Adaptation;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Rattus;Research Personnel;Site;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Training;Transducers;Universities;active lifestyle;adverse outcome;animal data;animal imaging;animal model development;blood glucose regulation;body system;cognitive function;endurance exercise;exercise capacity;exercise intervention;exercise program;experience;genetic technology;global health;heart function;human model;imaging genetics;improved;member;metabolomics;model development;mortality risk;novel;physical inactivity;pre-clinical;prevent;resistance exercise;response;skills;strength training;success;trait;transcriptomics","MoTrPAC: UC Preclinical Animal Study Site","NARRATIVEPhysical activity is known to prevent or treat many of the chronic diseases that are currently plaguingAmerica.

"Contraception/Reproduction; Genetics; Infertility; Minority Health; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Women's Health","Project summary: Obesity is a global public health issue. A number of chemicals precipitate amenorrheapremature menopause and infertility in females. Affected women experience chronic permanent health effectssince the proportion of their life spent post-menopause is lengthened thereby increasing the likelihood ofassociated health complication development (including coronary heart disease obesity type II diabetesosteoporosis and depression). Reproductive dysfunction also results from obesity and we have published anumber of studies demonstrating that the ovary of an obese female has heightened sensitivity to chemicalexposures that induce ovarian damage and infertility. This increased sensitivity arises from altered abundanceof chemical metabolism proteins within the ovary and raises concern about increased risk to obese women ofenvironmental chemical exposures that target the ovary. Our strong published and preliminary data support that the ovary of obese females have altered chemicalmetabolism in addition to a blunted DNA repair response when exposed to chemicals that cause DNA damage.This is concerning since DNA damage can lead to loss of fertility in females or represent a risk to offspringhealth should this damage be improperly repaired. Indeed offspring of obese women have increased rates ofbirth defects. We have demonstrated our findings in adult post-pubertal mice however whether these impactsare also noted in females who experience an obese environment during gestation or pre-pubertally remainsunclear but represents a major concern for female public health. In light of our strong and worrying evidencefor a heightened sensitivity of the obese female ovary to chemical-induced damage we will mechanisticallyinvestigate our central hypothesis that obesity potentiates ovotoxicity through reduced repair of DNAdamage altered ovarian chemical biotransformation and induction of oxidative stress. We will utilizethe alkylating agent dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to induce ovarian DNA damage at three stages ofimportance in ovarian development; during gestation pre-puberty and post-puberty. We will investigate ourhypothesis through completion of three specific aims: Aim 1 will investigate obesity effects on DNA repairresponse to DMBA exposure; Aim 2 will examine obesity-induced impacts on DMBA chemical metabolism; andAim 3 will determine effects of DMBA exposure and obesity on induction of ovarian oxidative stress. This workis applicable to general female health ovarian toxicity infertility and even extends to carcinogenesis. The datahas basic and translational importance and is relevant to the NIEHS mission.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYCandidate. My career goal is to improve the detection and management options for disseminated infectiousdiseases through investigation of host-microbe interactions. I plan to pursue this with a tenure-track appointmentas junior faculty with significant protected time for basic research. In the short term my goal is to broaden myskills as an investigator and build the foundation for my transition to independent research. The educationaspects of this proposal center around experimental mycology and gene expression analysis new skills whichwill enable me to improve our understanding of disseminated fungal infections from both host and pathogenperspectives.Research. Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is a devastating disease most common in theimmunocompromised such as AIDS or transplant patients. The brain infection is very difficult to treat and canoccur months or even years after the initial exposureoften an unnoticed pulmonary infection. Thus the fungusis thought to exist in a quiescent state for long periods in healthy individuals and while in this state does notappear to be susceptible to antifungal treatment. A better understanding of the quiescent state how it is initiatedand maintained should provide us with better detection and management tools and give us the chance tomanage this quiescent infection before it causes a deadly disease. The zebrafish larva as a model host allows direct monitoring of microbial pathogenesis in vivo. In contrastto findings in cell culture models in the zebrafish we find that inoculated Cryptococcus can have multiple fatesincluding clearance replication and dissemination or quiescence within phagocytes. This quiescent state whichcan last for as long as long as the larva is viable is common after spore infection but rare when larvae areinoculated with the yeast form. I will use spore infection as a model for early quiescent infection. The proposedexperiments are designed to define the features of the host response that allow for persistence and to definethe state of cryptococcal cells that induce this response.Career Development Plan. During the proposed research period my primary goal will be to carry forward myprevious work in innate immunity to cryptococcal infection while adding considerations of fungal biology to myapproach to the disease. I will also obtain new training in gene expression analysis biostatistics and fungalbiology through mentoring hands-on bench research and didactic learning. Along with this I plan to develop newskills in leadership mentoring and management to enable my transition to independence.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Abstract The Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system (T3SS) functions like a molecularsyringe to inject toxins into host cells. The primary cellular targets are phagocytes and epithelialcells. The injected toxins promote phagocytic avoidance and tissue destruction resulting insystemic spread of the bacteria and overwhelming sepsis. Deployment of the T3SS is highlyregulated and only activated when bacteria contact host cell surfaces. The overriding hypothesisguiding the studies is that increased understanding of mechanisms that regulate T3SS geneexpression will lead to the identification of critical steps that can be targeted by anti-virulencetherapeutics the long term goal of the proposed work. The primary protein required for contact-dependent activation of the T3SS is a transcription factor called ExsA. Preliminary datademonstrate that exsA transcription ExsA synthesis and ExsA activity are each subject tocontrol by global regulatory systems. The goals of this proposal are to define novel mechanismsthat control exsA transcription and possibly ExsA synthesis or activity. Our preliminary datademonstrate that the 297 bp intergenic region located between exsB and exsA functions in twocapacities. First the intergenic region contains a Vfr-dependent promoter dedicated to exsAtranscription. Vfr is cAMP-dependent transcription factor previously known to regulate T3SSgene expression but the mechanism has not been defined. Second expression of the intergenicregion in trans has a stimulatory effect on T3SS gene expression. Preliminary data suggest thattwo small peptides encoded within the intergenic region modulate T3SS gene expression. Thethree aims will characterize the stimulatory activity of the intergeneic region and factors thatregulate intergenic promoter activity as follows: Aim 1. Characterize the trans-acting functions of ExsF and ExsG. Aim 2. Characterize IR promoter activity. Aim 3. Determine whether Vfr MvaT/MvaU and VqsM function together antagonistically or independently to modulate IR promoter activity.","Animals;Bacteria;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical Genetics;Cell surface;Cells;ChIP-seq;Cyclic AMP;DNA Binding;Data;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Complementation Test;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Histones;Human;Infection;Initiator Codon;Intercistronic Region;Knowledge;Laboratories;Life;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Nosocomial pneumonia;Open Reading Frames;Operon;Peptides;Phagocytes;Phenotype;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Postoperative Period;Promoter Regions;Property;Proteins;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Regulation;Role;Sepsis;Site;Syringes;System;Therapeutic;Tissues;Toxin;Transcript;Transcription Coactivator;Translating;Type III Secretion System Pathway;Urinary tract;Virulence;Work;cellular targeting;cohesion;cytotoxic;expectation;experimental study;genetic approach;human pathogen;interest;mutant;novel;opportunistic pathogen;organizational structure;pathogen;promoter;quorum sensing;transcription factor","Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion","NarrativePseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes life-threatening infectionsin humans and is reliant on a secretion system that inject toxins into host cells.

"Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Minority Health; Neurosciences; Stroke","AbstractHaving a stroke is a frightening experience for both the patient and their loved ones. A major source of anxietyis not knowing what stroke-related deficits will persist  will my loved one ever be able to talk again? Thelikelihood for recovery is estimated by the treating neurologist or rehabilitation specialist based on theirpersonal experience. There are no tools available that can use information about the location of the strokequery it against the outcomes from hundreds or thousands of other individuals and generate a personalizedquantitative prediction of stroke-related deficits and prognosis for long-term recovery. Here we propose todevelop such a tool. At the University of Iowa we have one of the most comprehensive lesion registries in theworld of some 3500 patients with focal acquired brain lesions neuroimaging and extensive data on outcomes.We propose to capitalize on this unique resource by developing a tool to predict cognitive outcomes fromstroke based on lesion location. First we propose to map brain regions most associated with specific cognitivedeficits across over 1000 patients including symptoms such as difficulty speaking or problems with attention.Next in a prospectively collected cohort with acute ischemic stroke we will attempt to predict cognitiveoutcomes by querying lesion location against the aforementioned symptom maps. We hypothesize that lesionlocation will be a significant predictor of chronic cognitive outcomes. Second we have recently developed aninnovative strategy that links lesion-associated deficits to specific brain networks. It combines traditional lesionmapping with human connectome data from healthy adults to infer what networks are disrupted by focal brainlesions. We will evaluate whether this lesion network mapping approach can be used to compliment thetraditional lesion mapping approach to predict additional variance in cognitive outcomes. Finally we will useadvanced statistical modeling to evaluate how predictive information from lesion location can be optimallyintegrated with demographic information and baseline screening cognitive performance to maximizepredictions of chronic cognitive outcomes in a longitudinal cohort. By addressing these objectives we will laythe foundation for developing a clinical tool that can be applied to a clinically-acquired MRI scan to aid indetermining the prognosis of cognitive outcomes a key factor that will help in the early managementrehabilitation and life planning for patients with stroke.","Acute;Address;Adult;Age;Anxiety;Attention;Brain;Brain region;Chronic;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Data;Databases;Decision Making;Diagnosis;Education;Factor Analysis;Focal Brain Injuries;Foundations;Gender;Handedness;Human;Impaired cognition;Individual;International;Iowa;Ischemic Stroke;Language;Lesion;Life;Link;Location;Longitudinal cohort;MRI Scans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Manuals;Maps;Masks;Medical;Memory;Methods;Neurologist;Neuropsychological Tests;Neurosciences Research;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patients;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Prognosis;Provider;Recovery;Registries;Rehabilitation therapy;Resources;Risk;Scanning;Site;Source;Specialist;Statistical Models;Stroke;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Symptoms;Testing;Translating;Universities;Work;base;clinical care;cognitive performance;cognitive testing;cohort;common symptom;connectome;connectome data;demographics;design;disability;disabling symptom;experience;human data;improved;innovation;insight;loved ones;multiple data sources;neuroimaging;outcome prediction;performance tests;personalized predictions;post stroke;prospective;public health relevance;screening;stroke outcome;stroke patient;tool;vascular risk factor","Predicting Cognitive Outcomes from Stroke Based on Lesion Location","Public Health RelevanceWe propose to map specific domains of cognitive impairment that occur following focal brain injury such asdeficits in language memory and attention to specific brain regions.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) and associated arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD) are primary causes of morbidityand mortality worldwide warranting further investigation of risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms. Preciseregulation of cardiac ion channels governing heart rate and rhythm is vital since slight changes in ionconductance can trigger arrhythmia elevating ones risk for SCD. The cardiac action potential is initiated bysodium current through the hearts primary voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5 encoded by SCN5A.Mutations that alter Nav1.5 function cause arrhythmic syndromes (Brugada long QT inherited conduction) anddilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and common genetic variants within the SCN5A locus have been linked to subtlechanges in electrocardiographic measures. However the impact of altered SCN5A expression on the clinicalcourse of HF and associated non-arrhythmic deaths remains to be thoroughly investigated. Prior studies have shown that SCN5A+/- haploinsufficient mice develop aging-related adverse myocardialremodeling with increased fibrosis and conduction slowing. We recently discovered that these findings maytranslate to the clinical setting. Specifically we identified a common genetic variant that bolsters the activity of amicroRNA (miR) binding site within the terminal coding sequence (CDS) of SCN5A. We found that this variantis linked to reduced SCN5A mRNA levels (10-20%) in human hearts and surprisingly increased non-arrhythmicdeath in HF patients. A potential basis for this was identified upon our unexpected finding that SCN5A+/- mousehearts exhibit increases in oxidative stress and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). These combined preliminary dataprovide a solid foundation for our central hypothesis that reduced cardiac SCN5A expression elevates onessusceptibility to subclinical cardiac pathologies that transform into significant risk in the setting of HF. With thecore concept being that low Nav1.5 is bad for your heart our overarching goals are now to 1) define newpathways controlling Nav1.5 levels 2) delineate how lower Nav1.5 adversely impacts cardiomyocytes and 3)empirically test if reduced Nav1.5 worsens HF outcomes. In Aim 1 we will characterize novel pathways thatregulate SCN5A mRNA stability and translation via its CDS an expansive region that remains largelyunderexplored for RNA regulatory functions. In Aim 2 we will define the pathways by which reduced SCN5Aexpression in cardiomyocytes leads to elevated oxidative stress and FAO. In Aim 3 we will determine if reducedSCN5A expression is sufficient to increase HF-related morbidity and mortality in SCN5A+/- haploinsufficient micewith surgically-induced cardiomyopathy. Overall this work has strong potential to 1) fill significant knowledgegaps regarding the regulatory control of SCN5A at the RNA level 2) transform our understanding of Nav1.5functions beyond well-established roles in cardiac conduction 3) reinforce the link between reduced SCN5Aexpression and worse HF advancing from associative observations to empirical evidence and 4) prompt futurestudies aimed at translating these findings towards improved identification and care of high-risk HF patients.","Action Potentials;Address;Aging;Anabolism;Arrhythmia;Binding Sites;Bioinformatics;Biology;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiac health;Cardiomyopathies;Caring;Cessation of life;Clinical;Code;Data;Dilated Cardiomyopathy;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Exhibits;Fibrosis;Foundations;Future;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Genetic Translation;Goals;Grant;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Rate;Heart failure;Human;Inherited;Investigation;Ion Channel;Ions;Knock-out;Knowledge;Link;Measures;Messenger RNA;Metabolic;Metabolic stress;Metabolism;MicroRNAs;Mitochondria;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mutation;NADPH Oxidase;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathogenicity;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Predisposing Factor;Predisposition;Prevalence;Publishing;RNA;RNA-Binding Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Research Support;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sodium;Sodium Channel;Solid;Structure;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic Studies;Transcript;Translating;Variant;Ventricular Remodeling;Woman;Work;cost;fatty acid oxidation;genetic variant;heart function;heart rhythm;high risk;improved;mRNA Expression;mRNA Stability;men;mitochondrial metabolism;mortality;mortality risk;novel;novel therapeutics;prevent;public health relevance;response;sudden cardiac death;voltage","Regulation and role of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5 in heart failure","PROJECT NARRATIVEPublic Health Relevance: Heart failure and associated sudden cardiac death are leading causes of morbidityand mortality for both men and women worldwide.

As the prevalence of PD increases so too does the use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as asurgical treatment option when medications fail to control motor fluctuations or side effects frommedications limit their efficacy. As many as 15% of the more than 1 million American PD patients are feltto be candidates for DBS. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is the most common target utilized for DBS and limb motor outcomesafter STN-DBS show reliable and consistent improvement in properly selected patients. On the otherhand speech motor outcomes after STN-DBS are unpredictable and more patients experiencedeterioration of speech than those that notice improved speech. An estimated 40% of STN-DBS patientsnotice worsened speech and with declines significant enough to reduce quality of life. Furthermore feweffective treatments exist to provide sustained improvement in speech performance for those withimpaired speech. In order to optimize and develop better treatments for those living with PD it is necessary to betterunderstand the role of STN in speech as contemporary mechanistic models of human speech productionomit STN. Here we study 80 PD patients undergoing bilateral STN-DBS along with 40 non-surgical PDcontrol subjects to address existing critical knowledge gaps. We will document speech performance ofboth groups through functional communication ability (i.e. objective measures of intelligibility and avalidated survey tool for quantifying communication participation) and instrumental speech (i.e. acoustic)measures pre-surgery 6- and 12-months post-surgery with all subjects off PD medications and with theSTN-DBS subjects evaluated with stimulation ON & OFF at both post-operative timepoints. Directneuronal recordings will be obtained during DBS implantation surgery during both speech and limb motortasks to define speech-specific STN neurophysiology. In addition we will perform regression analysesusing baseline patient factors and intraoperative physiology findings to identify factors leading to thespeech outcomes we will document and test the feasibility of low frequency DBS in reversing DBS-induced speech declines. To our knowledge this data will be the first of its kind to evaluate patients before during and aftersurgery with the goals of both directly defining the role of STN in speech and predicting speech outcomeafter STN-DBS. Such knowledge will provide mechanistic insights that cannot be obtained using othertechniques and will guide development of new treatments of impaired speech in PD.","Acoustics;Acute;Address;Aftercare;American;Articulation;Behavior;Bilateral;Brain;Characteristics;Cohort Studies;Communication;Control Groups;Data;Deep Brain Stimulation;Deterioration;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Exhibits;Failure;Family;Frequencies;Future;Goals;Impairment;Knowledge;Limb structure;Literature;Measures;Microelectrodes;Motor;Movement;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outcome Study;Parkinson Disease;Participant;Patients;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Pilot Projects;Postoperative Period;Predictive Factor;Prevalence;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Regression Analysis;Reporting;Research;Respiratory physiology;Role;STN stimulation;Source;Speech;Structure of subthalamic nucleus;Surveys;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic Effect;Time;awake;base;disorder control;disparity reduction;effective therapy;experience;feasibility testing;human model;implantation;improved;insight;motor control;motor symptom;neural model;neurophysiology;preoperative counseling;prospective;reduce symptoms;respiratory;side effect;tool;treatment optimization;treatment strategy","Role of Subthalamic nucleus in Speech and Movement among people with Parkinsons as Revealed by Intraoperative Recordings and Deep Brain Stimulation","PROJECT NARRATIVEParkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus(STN) have unpredictable and varied speech outcomes after this treatment.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes; Digestive Diseases; Lung; Rare Diseases","Project SummaryCystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is a unique form of diabetes which develops in the majority of patientswith non-mild cystic fibrosis (CF) by middle age. Even when the degree of hyperglycemia is minimal CFRDworsens lung disease and shortens life expectancy. The causes of CFRD are multifactorial and includeinsufficient insulin secretion hepatic insulin resistance and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. While exocrineinsufficiency is explained by deficient pancreatic ductal anion transport due to loss of cystic fibrosistransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function the causes of diminished insulin secretion and hepaticinsulin resistance are not fully understood. CF induces significant primary disease not only in the exocrinepancreas but also in stomach and intestine owing to loss of CFTR function in the gut epithelium. Relatedly avariety of gut / splanchnic hormones are disrupted in CF and these alterations have been postulated tocontribute to CFRD. The most consistently altered splanchnic hormone in CF is pancreatic polypeptide (PP) ahormone whose metabolic actions have been neglected following the finding that PP-knockout (PP-KO) micelack a glucose metabolism phenotype. PP levels are universally low in CF and unresponsive to physiologicalstimuli that normally induce secretion. We find circulating PP deficiency is present even in very young childrenwith CF and in CFTR-KO ferrets despite abundant PP-cells in the pancreas. Using these CF ferrets and newlygenerated PP-KO ferrets we find that supplementation and deficiency of PP have broad effects on glucosemetabolism representing the first molecular genetic data confirming classic physiological studies indicatingmetabolic effects of PP. We hypothesize that PP deficiency in CF represents an underlying parasympatheticneuronal defect in islet function and contributes to insulin resistance in the liver of individuals with CF. Todetermine the mechanism causing deficient PP secretion in CF we will test the functional structural andneurochemical integrity of parasympathetic neuronal innervation to the PP-secreting cells of the pancreas.Using traced euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps we will determine the mechanism by which PPsupplementation using peptide and genetic approaches improves glucose tolerance in PP-KO and CF ferretsand determine the PP-receptor involved in this action. We will examine whether PP supplementation throughits pancreatostatic actions lessens exocrine pancreatic destruction in CF. Finally through a newly createdCFTR-G551D mutant knock-in ferret where the function of the CFTR mutant can be restored by a smallmolecule potentiator we will investigate the connections between early exocrine pancreatic disease in CF andsubsequent endocrine pancreas dysfunction including poor PP secretion. Our studies will not only increaseunderstanding of the glucoregulatory actions of PP but are expected to unlock new understanding of CFRDpathogenesis. The knowledge gained will help open new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to CFRD andalso to other hyperglycemic low-PP states such as diabetes complicating chronic pancreatitis.","Acute;Affect;Animals;Anions;Area;Birth;Cells;Cessation of life;Chemosensitization;Chronic;Closure by clamp;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Dependence;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Environment;Exhibits;Exocrine pancreas;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency;Ferrets;Fibrocystic Disease of Pancreas;Functional disorder;Glucose;Hepatic;Hormonal;Hormones;Human;Hyperglycemia;Hyperinsulinism;Hypoglycemia;Impairment;In Vitro;Individual;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Intestines;Investigation;Islets of Langerhans;Joints;Knock-in;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Life;Life Expectancy;Link;Liver;Lung diseases;Mediating;Metabolic;Modeling;Molecular Genetics;Mutation;Neurons;Organ;Outcomes Research;Pancreas;Pancreatic Diseases;Pancreatic Polypeptide;Pancreatic duct;Pathology;Patients;Peptides;Peripheral;Phenotype;Physiological;Prevention;Publishing;Respiratory Failure;Role;Stimulus;Stomach;Structure;Supplementation;Testing;Thick;Transcript;VX-770;Viral;Visceral;Weight;Work;base;children with cystic fibrosis;chronic pancreatitis;cystic fibrosis patients;cystic fibrosis related diabetes;diabetes mellitus therapy;diabetes pathogenesis;diabetes risk;functional loss;gastrointestinal epithelium;gene therapy;genetic approach;glucose metabolism;glucose tolerance;high risk;improved;insulin secretion;insulin sensitivity;islet;metabolic phenotype;middle age;mutant;neglect;nerve supply;neurochemistry;novel;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;pancreatic juice;prevent;receptor;reconstitution;restoration;small molecule;synthetic peptide","Splanchno-Hormonal Mechanisms of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes","Project NarrativeFor unclear reasons most people who have cystic fibrosis will develop diabetes by middle age placing them atmuch higher risk of lung failure and death.

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Depression; Genetics; Human Genome; Major Depressive Disorder; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Serious Mental Illness","AbstractPsychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) are complex diseases where negativestressors increase the likelihood of its onset through epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation (DNAm).Presently disease-associated DNAm patterns of MDD have not been fully elucidated. This is in part due to thereliance of peripheral tissues such as blood buccal cells and saliva where it is unknown how DNAm changesfrom these tissues might be an accurate reflection of those changes in the brain. As such there is an urgentneed to provide a comprehensive database that would cross-compare DNAm patterns between the brain andother peripheral tissues to highlight candidate regions where disease-associated DNAm can be observed. Tothis end our overall goal is to establish a comprehensive epigenomic database where DNAm patterns can becross-compared between key brain regions (e.g. the hippocampus amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontalcortex) their neurons and glia components and peripheral tissues. Our central hypothesis is that disease-associated DNAm will more likely reside in regions that vary in DNAm between different tissues. Our specificaims will address the following questions: In Aim 1 DNAm will be evaluated at a genome-wide level and cross-compared between brain and peripheral tissues to identify regions which have varying DNAm between tissues.In Aim 2 we will expand DNAm assessment in neuron and glia to the aforementioned key brain regionsinvolved in MDD and compare that with peripheral tissues. In Aim 3 disease-associated DNAm regions will beevaluated using pathology-archived brain tissues from 206 MDD cases and 206 matched controls. This is thelargest post-mortem study of MDD that specifically evaluates DNAm. Disease-associated DNAm will beoverlaid with tissue-specific DNAm to determine regions where MDD-associated DNAm patterns will likely tooccur. This proposed study is significant as it will provide a comprehensive epigenetic database that will guideresearchers to candidate regions and suitable peripheral tissues to investigate DNAm changes in MDD. Its usemay also be extended to other psychiatric disorders. This proposed study is innovative as it uses fresh brainneuron glia and peripheral tissues from the same individual to establish an epigenome database. It also usesdisease-associated DNAm identified from a large cohort of post-mortem MDD brains to identify regions that arehot-spots for disease-associated methylation changes.","Address;Age;Amygdaloid structure;Archives;Autopsy;Biological Markers;Blood;Brain;Brain Diseases;Brain region;Cells;Collaborations;Collection;Communities;Complex;DNA;DNA Databases;DNA Methylation;Data;Data Set;Databases;Depressed mood;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Environment;Epigenetic Process;Excision;Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting;Functional disorder;Future;Genomic Segment;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Hot Spot;Human;Individual;Iowa;Lead;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;Mental disorders;Methylation;MicroRNAs;Modification;Neuroglia;Neurons;Neurosurgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Peripheral;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevention;Process;Research;Research Personnel;Resected;Resource Allocation;Resources;Saliva;Sample Size;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Swab;Testing;Time;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Work;biomarker discovery;brain cell;brain tissue;cell type;cohort;epigenome;epigenomics;experience;genome-wide;high risk;histone modification;human tissue;improved;innovation;interest;large datasets;methylation pattern;neuropathology;neurosurgery;novel;novel strategies;prospective;public health relevance;research study;sex;specific biomarkers;stressor;therapy development;trend","Identification of Epigenetics Correlates between Brain and Peripheral Tissues","PROJECT NARRATIVEPUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder(MDD) are widespread yet they are difficult to diagnose and treat due to a lack of available biomarkers.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness","ABSTRACTThe cerebellum is densely connected to the cerebral cortex allowing it to powerfully modulate diverse cognitive networks.The specific mechanisms by which the cerebellum modulates the frontal cortex are unknown. In neuropsychiatric diseasessuch as schizophrenia and autism deficits in working memory attention reasoning and timing are accompanied bycerebellar abnormalities  both structural and functional. There are currently no effective treatments for cognitivedysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease. Understanding cerebellar modulation of frontal circuits may lead to noveltreatments targeting the cerebellum for cognitive dysfunction in human disease. For instance cerebellar transcranialmagnetic stimulation has been effective in improving cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. Our goal is to understandhow the cerebellum encodes timing for key cognitive events in order to understand how cerebellar stimulation influencescognition and frontal cortical activity. We will determine the lateral cerebellar nuclear and cerebellar cortical contributionto timing of key cognitive events by investigating how these regions encode time-dependent neuronal activity. We willdetermine if cerebellar stimulation can correct dysfunctional frontal cortical activity rescuing timing and cognitiveperformance.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Pediatric","PROJECT SUMMARYLanguage and reading impairments affect 16%-20% of US children and are stable persisting throughadolescence and adulthood. Deficits in even low level skills like phonological processing and spoken wordrecognition persist through adulthood and half of middle-school struggling readers show deficits in decodingand written word recognition. This proposal examines the development of spoken and written word recognitionduring late childhood. While words are a low-level language skill at these ages they are central to languagelinking phonology orthography and meaning. At a cognitive level word recognition is seen as a competitionprocess. As the input (e.g. wizard) is heard (or read) people consider multiple partially matching words(whistle lizard) which compete over time. Prior work assessed this in children using a paradigm in whichlisteners match words to pictures while eye-movements are monitored. As listeners begin to hear a word theireyes move between candidates. These fixations reveal momentary consideration of alternative words andtrace the dynamics of competition over milliseconds. We applied this to children showing that competition isresolved more automatically between 9 and 16 years. Adolescents with language impairment showed adifferent pattern: they were similarly automatic but did not fully resolve competition by the end of processing. This research documents that real-time processing develops but it is unclear how. In older children it islikely due to multiple causes such as vocabulary growth the organization of phonological systems the onset ofreading instruction and changes in executive function. This project examines the development and disordersin the automaticity and degree of competition resolution during lexical processing. It examines both spokenand written word processing to unpack the relationship between language and reading and identify outcomes(good and poor) linked to differences in real-time processing. The first aim is to determine the cognitive anddevelopmental factors that shape real-time word recognition and the consequences of this for language andreading outcomes. We conduct an accelerated longitudinal study of 400 children (normal and impaired)between 7 and 12 combining eye-tracking measures of word recognition with tests of phonological processingreading vocabulary and executive function. The second aim uses cross-sectional laboratory studies toexamine the consequences of differences in real-time processing for learning and for related processes likesemantic processing (meaning) or orthographic decoding (mapping sound to print). The third aim useslaboratory training procedures to understand plasticity in real-time lexical processing; this may pave the way forpotential interventions targeting lexical processing. Finally the fourth aim develops computational models ofnormal and disordered lexical processing to attain a deeper understanding of what mechanisms of languageprocessing are changing with development or differ in disordered language users.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Age;Child;Childhood;Cognitive;Computer Models;Consequentialism;Coping Skills;Cross-Sectional Studies;Development;Disease;Eye;Eye Movements;Funding;Grant;Growth;Hearing;Impairment;Infant;Instruction;Intervention;Knowledge;Laboratory Study;Language;Language Disorders;Learning;Life;Link;Lizards;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;Measures;Modeling;Monitor;Nursery Schools;Oral;Orthography;Outcome;Pattern;Persons;Play;Procedures;Process;Property;Psycholinguistics;Reader;Reading;Reading Disabilities;Reporting;Research;Resolution;School-Age Population;Schools;Semantics;Shapes;Speech;Speech Perception;Structure;System;Testing;Text;Time;Training;Vocabulary;Word Processing;Work;base;cognitive system;comorbidity;executive function;junior high school;laboratory experience;language impairment;language processing;lexical;lexical processing;millisecond;phonology;reading ability;remediation;sample fixation;semantic processing;skills;sound;syntax;theories;visual tracking;word learning","The Development of Real Time Spoken and Written Word Recognition: Cognitive Bases of Language and Educational Outcomes","HEALTH RELEVANCELanguage and reading impairments affect 16% of children and deficits in even low level skills like wordrecognition and word reading persist through the lifespan leading to poor academic and life outcomes.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences","AbstractSurvival in a hostile environment requires the ability to assess potential threats and take the most appropriatedefensive action. Accumulating evidence suggests that the amygdala is well positioned to integrate informationabout threats and to guide or shift responses along a spectrum of potential defensive behaviors. In bothhumans and mice the amygdala plays an essential role in defensive responses to the threat of suffocationsignaled by rising systemic carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the body. Lesioning the amygdala or manipulating itmore precisely in other ways reduces some defensive behaviors evoked by CO2 inhalation (e.g. freezing)while simultaneously increasing others (e.g. fight-or-flight). Because CO2 inhalation evokes a variety ofdefensive responses in a robust reproducible and concentration-dependent manner CO2 provides astraightforward and translatable approach to studying the amygdala's role in defensive behavior regulation. Inthis application we propose to study defensive behaviors evoked by CO2 using state-of-the-art neuron-specific manipulations and electrophysiological recording to deconstruct roles of select neuron populations inthe basolateral amygdala (BLA). We hypothesize that distinct defensive behaviors are differentially regulatedby the BLA and that principal neurons and interneurons in the BLA each play unique roles. To test thishypothesis we will use genetic optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches to specifically activate andsilence specific BLA neuron populations and quantify the effects on neural activity and defensive behaviors.Together these experiments will allow us to discern how these neurons regulate different defensive behaviors.Understanding basic mechanisms that guide or shift defensive behaviors along their spectrum will be essentialfor identifying abnormalities in these processes and for finding ways to correct them. This knowledge willultimately impact mental illnesses where defensive behaviors are inappropriately extreme such as panicdisorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.","ASIC channel;Amygdaloid structure;Asphyxia;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Carbon Dioxide;Data;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;Equilibrium;Foundations;Freezing;Genetic;Glutamates;Goals;Human;Impairment;Inhalation;Inhibitory Synapse;Interneurons;Knowledge;Lesion;Mediating;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Mus;National Institute of Mental Health;Negative Valence;Neurobiology;Neurons;Output;Panic;Panic Disorder;Parvalbumins;Play;Population;Positioning Attribute;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Process;Psychotic Disorders;Regulation;Reproducibility;Research Domain Criteria;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Somatostatin;Symptoms;System;Testing;Translational Research;Translations;Work;base;behavioral response;conditioned fear;experimental study;fighting;improved;innovation;optogenetics;receptor;relating to nervous system;response","Basolateral amygdala circuits in defensive behavior regulation","NarrativeDefensive behaviors are encompassed within the negative valence systems construct of the NIMH ResearchDomain Criteria (RDoC) project which was conceived to provide a translational research framework for mentalillnesses.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Neurosciences","Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordinationof neural systems mediating cognition emotion and motor control. The major goal of theproposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactionsbetween cognitive emotional and motor systems during associative learning. Interactionsbetween these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotionalsignificance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motorresponses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive emotional and motor systems invarious neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learnedbehaviors. The prefrontal cortex amygdala and cerebellum play significant roles in cognitionemotional responses and motor learning respectively. The proposed research programconstitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontalcortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that thecerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regardingwhich stimuli are important and when they occur and the cerebellum then sends error-drivenfeedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. Thisconceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellumand the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-siteelectrophysiology pathway-specific optogenetics and precise behavioral analyses will becombined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum amygdala andprefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. Theproposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanismsunderlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution tothe field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in manycontexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning memory planning control ofemotions and communication but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebelluminteracts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.","Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Animals;Area;Attention;Behavioral;Blinking;Cerebellum;Cognition;Cognitive;Communication;Conditioned Stimulus;Data;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Emotional;Emotions;Environment;Etiology;Event;Extinction (Psychology);Feedback;Funding;Goals;Image;Learning;Life;Medial;Mediating;Memory;Memory impairment;Methods;Motor;Nature;Organism;Output;Pathway interactions;Performance;Physiological;Play;Pontine structure;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Prosencephalon;Rattus;Research;Role;Safety;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Site;Stimulus;Stroke;Structure;System;Testing;Training;classical conditioning;conditioned fear;granule cell;indexing;learned behavior;learning extinction;machine learning algorithm;motor control;motor learning;nervous system disorder;neural circuit;neuromechanism;novel;optogenetics;programs;relating to nervous system;response;two-photon","Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning","Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer'sdisease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systemscan be particularly debilitating.

"Aging; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease","Project Summary/Abstract Aging is associated with an exponential increase in the incidence of cardiovasculardiseases (CVD). Several mechanisms underlying age-associated cardiac changes in fly modeland vertebrates have been proposed for example decreased cellular quality control alteredcalcium handling increased mitochondria damage and the production of reactive oxygen species(ROS). Cellular quality control systems like autophagy are essential protective mechanisms forthe maintenance of tissue homeostasis during cardiac aging. It is well-known that autophagydeclines with age. However the molecular basis for age-dependent dysregulation of autophagyand its contribution to cardiac homeostasis remain largely unknown. Our recent studies uncovered an exciting link between activin and mechanistic target ofrapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) in the regulation of autophagy and cardiac aging. We alsonoticed that two mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) seem to play distinct roles inautophagy regulation. Furthermore through genetic screening we identified several activin-regulated systemic factors (e.g. Upd3 the fly homology of mammalian Interleukin 6 IL-6) thatcan mediate tissue-tissue communication and maintain cardiac homeostasis. In this proposal weaim to dissect the distinct mechanisms by which activin signaling regulate autophagy and age-dependent cardiac dysfunctions through the interactions with two important pathways mTORC2and JAK-STAT. To achieve the overall objective we propose two specific aims. Specific Aim 1:Determine how activin interacts with mTORC2 to regulate autophagy and cardiac aging; SpecificAim 2: Determine the role of activin and Upd3 in oenocyte-heart communication during aging. The mechanistic understanding of the tissue specificity and the underlying function ofactivin in cardiac aging will provide strong justification for its continued development as a noveltarget for potential therapeutic intervention.","5&apos;-AMP-activated protein kinase;Activins;Age;Aging;Autophagocytosis;Autophagosome;Calcium;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiac health;Cardiomyopathies;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cells;Clinical;Communication;Complex;Development;Drosophila genus;Elderly;FRAP1 gene;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Heart;Heart Diseases;Hepatocyte;Homeostasis;Hormonal;IL6 gene;Incidence;Interleukin-6;Intervention;Link;Longevity;Maintenance;Mediating;Medical;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Myocardial dysfunction;Organ;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Play;Production;Quality Control;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;System;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Vertebrates;age related;biological adaptation to stress;fly;genetic analysis;heart function;novel","Autonomous and Non-Autonomous Regulation of Cardiac Aging","Project NarrativeResolving the contributing mechanisms of heart diseases is a pressing goal of basic andtranslational aging research.

Because of compromises to many aspects of HRQOL combined with low ratesof survival for the majority of these patients development of innovative approaches for improving HRQOLand potentially improving clinical outcomes is of paramount importance. This need is particularly true inrural settings where women may have less access to clinic-based support systems. Despite the multiplechallenges experienced by ovarian cancer survivors research targeting the potential efficacy ofpsychosocial interventions in enhancing HRQOL has been extremely limited. Over the last several yearsthis research team has developed and piloted a web-based group conferencing intervention entitledLiving Well (Web-Enhanced Lessons for Living) targeting key concerns of ovarian cancer survivors anddeveloped with input from survivors. The overarching goal of the present submission is to examine theefficacy of the Living Well intervention vs. a Health Promotion active control intervention in a randomizedcontrolled trial in 256 ovarian cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment and are less than5-years post-diagnosis. We hypothesize that the Living Well Intervention will be efficacious in improvingHRQOL decreasing perceived stress (primary outcomes) and in decreasing depressive mood anxietyand fatigue (secondary outcomes). This application is highly innovative because it combines elements ofevidence-based psychosocial interventions in a novel way to target the needs of ovarian cancer survivorsusing a state-of-the-art web and video conferencing platform that allows wide dissemination including torural survivors. This work is highly translational as it is a direct application of findings from mechanisticstress-related research to testing an intervention to reduce stress in ovarian cancer survivors.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Human Genome; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Pediatric Cancer; Rare Diseases","Project Summary/Abstract TAZ/YAP are transcriptional effectors and proto-oncoproteins of the Hippo pathway a signal transductionpathway regulating tumor growth and metastasis in multiple cancers including sarcomas. While much has beenuncovered with regards to the upstream regulation of TAZ and YAP little is known about epigenetic regulationof their transcriptional programs representing a significant gap in knowledge. To address this gap we utilizedthe TAZ-CAMTA1 (TC) and YAP-TFE3 (YT) fusion proteins. TC and YT are driving oncoproteins in epithelioidhemangioendothelioma (EHE) a sarcoma arising in adolescents (responsive to PA-16-251 Gene Fusions inPediatric Sarcomas). TC and YT hyperactivated forms of TAZ and YAP are relevant because gene fusionsare the most common type of genetic alterations of TAZ/YAP in cancer. Our objective in this proposal is todetermine if TC and YT further stimulate TAZ/YAP transcription by altering the epigenome. Our centralhypothesis is that TC and YT recruit YEATS2 and ZZZ3 part of the Ada2a-containing (ATAC) histoneacetyltransferase complex which potentiate the TAZ/YAP oncogenic transcriptional programs. This hypothesisis supported by two serial unbiased approaches: BioID mass spectrometry followed by an shRNA screen thatidentified YEATS2 and ZZZ3 as the proteins most critical for TC driven anchorage independent growth. Weplan to test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims utilizing TC the predominant fusion proteinin EHE (85% of EHE):Aim 1) Determine how YEATS2 and ZZZ3 alter the TAZ-CAMTA1 transcriptional program.We will perform ChIP-seq and determine if TC co-localizes with YEATS2 and ZZZ3 on the genome. RNA-seqwill be performed in TC expressing cell lines with and without expression of YEATS2 or ZZZ3 to identify theireffects on the TC transcriptome.Aim 2) Identify domains of TAZ-CAMTA1 YEATS2 and ZZZ3 required for cellular transformation.The interaction of YEATS2 and ZZZ3 with TC will be dissected by co-immunoprecipitation utilizing deletionmutants.

The proposal is innovative because it utilizes TC and YT as well as two serial unbiased approaches toidentify YEATS2/ZZZ3/ATAC as novel epigenetic regulators of the TAZ/YAP transcriptome expanding thefocus of the field and addressing a significant gap in knowledge. The project is significant because it identifiesYEATS2 and ZZZ3 as novel oncoproteins and drivers in sarcoma and provides a rationale for inhibiting histonemodifying complexes as a novel way of targeting the Hippo pathway which currently lacks a therapeutic target.","Acetylation;Acetyltransferase;Address;Adolescent;Anchorage-Independent Growth;Automobile Driving;Biological Assay;Cell Line;ChIP-seq;Chimeric Proteins;Co-Immunoprecipitations;Complex;Coupled;Data;Ependymoma;Epigenetic Process;Gene Fusion;Genetic;Genetic Enhancer Element;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Goals;Growth and Development function;Hemangioendothelioma;Histologic;Histone Acetylation;Histones;Kinetics;Knowledge;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Medical;Mission;Mutation;Nasopharynx Carcinoma;Neoplasm Metastasis;Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma;Oncogenic;Oncoproteins;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Play;Primary Neoplasm;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;Regulation;Research;Role;Signal Transduction Pathway;Structure;System;TFE3 gene;Testing;Transactivation;Transcription Coactivator;Transgenic Organisms;United States National Institutes of Health;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;childhood sarcoma;epigenetic regulation;epigenome;histone acetyltransferase;in vivo;innovation;insight;metaplastic cell transformation;mouse model;mutant;novel;programs;recruit;sarcoma;small hairpin RNA;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;tumor growth;tumor initiation;tumorigenesis;validation studies","Epigenetic modulation of the TAZ-CAMTA1 transcriptional program by the Ada2a-containing histone acetyltransferase complex","Project NarrativeThe proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of a histone acetyltransferase theAda2-containing (ATAC) complex that regulates the TAZ/YAP transcriptional program in sarcomas willincrease understanding of how the transcriptional programs of TAZ/YAP are activated in various cancers thusproviding additional targets for therapy.

Pain that persists beyond the expected period of healing can be devastating toone's sense of well-being. In fact pain severity is highly correlated with adverse effects on physical functioning.Strong and consistent evidence indicates that patients with high anxiety and/or depressive symptoms (distress)prior to surgery are at risk for PPSP. Veterans are at particularly high risk for post-surgical problems because80% experience some level of psychological distress prior to surgery and 50% report experiencing pain on aregular basis. Scheduled surgery is a critical juncture with the healthcare system that provides an importantopportunity to identify and address these issues. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a trans-diagnostic and evidence-based treatment for depression anxiety and chronic pain. Importantly ACT has beeneffectively implemented in various treatment-delivery formats including intensive 1-day group workshops. This application proposes a multi-site double-blind two-arm parallel randomized controlled trialcomparing the effects of an ACT intervention to an attention control (AC) intervention in Veterans at-risk forPPSP following TKA. Veterans with high levels of pain and significant distress prior to TKA will be identified asat-risk. The primary aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of ACT compared to AC on pain andfunctioning in at-risk Veterans at 6 weeks 3 and 6 months post-TKA. The secondary aim is to examine theeffects of ACT compared to AC on depressive and anxiety symptoms and on coping skills. Mediationanalyses will be conducted to examine whether changes in depression anxiety and coping skills have animpact on pain and functioning. Finally we will explore the impact of the current opioid restrictions on the useof pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain management strategies following TKA. The current proposalbuilds on promising results from a R34-funded preliminary study. Providing this therapy prior to surgery for people struggling with depressive and anxiety symptoms for thepurpose of preventing PPSP and impaired functioning following surgery is innovative. It has the potential tochange clinical practice from a focus on management of postoperative pain to prevention of chronic pain in at-risk individuals. This project incorporates an interdisciplinary approach to the care of Veterans that attends tomajor risk factors of postoperative sequelae that significantly impact Veterans' quality of life and healthcareutilization. Thus it has the potential to translate what is known about effective treatments of distress andchronic pain to prevent poor surgical outcomes. The format is brief and innovative offering potential for optimaltreatment adherence participant acceptability and broad deployment to practice settings. Finally this moreconcentrated and time-limited approach allows for completion within a short window of time such as beforesurgery.","Activities of Daily Living;Acute;Address;Adverse effects;Anxiety;Arthroscopy;Attention;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Caring;Clinical;Coping Skills;Data;Diagnostic;Distress;Double-Blind Method;Educational workshop;Effectiveness;Equipment and supply inventories;Evidence based treatment;Exhibits;Fentanyl;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Health;Healthcare Systems;Impairment;Individual;Intervention;Knee;Life;Measures;Mediating;Mediation;Mediator of activation protein;Medical;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Moods;Operative Surgical Procedures;Opioid;Orthopedic Surgery;Outcome;Pain;Pain intensity;Pain management;Participant;Patients;Pattern;Personal Satisfaction;Pharmacology;Physical Function;Postoperative Pain;Postoperative Period;Powder dose form;Prevention;Prior Therapy;Process;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recovery;Reporting;Risk;Risk Factors;Schedule;Severities;Severity of illness;Site;Sleep;Source;Surveys;Symptoms;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Translating;Veterans;Well in self;addiction;anxiety symptoms;arm;attentional control;base;chronic pain;clinical practice;cognitive function;depressive symptoms;design;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;experience;gabapentin;healing;health care service utilization;high risk;high risk population;improved;innovation;insight;interdisciplinary approach;opioid epidemic;opioid use;optimal treatments;pain relief;pain symptom;physical insult;practice setting;prescription opioid;prevent;psychological distress;social;surgery outcome;symptomatic improvement;treatment adherence;treatment optimization;treatment response;trial comparing","Preventing Persistent Post-Surgical Pain and Dysfunction in At-Risk Veterans: Effect of a Brief Behavioral Intervention","Persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) and impaired functioning are common problems among patientsundergoing total knee arthroscopy.

"Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics","The long-term goals of the applicant are to become a successfully funded independent craniofacialdevelopmental biologist conducting human-disease-focused and translatable research aimed at improvingdental oral and craniofacial health. This overarching goal will be actualized by the implementation of a highlycoordinated thorough and integrated career development plan including components of mentored guidanceand training an adept research environment and a complementary research project. First a careerdevelopment plan comprised of a mentor advisory committee collaborators and courses and conferenceshas been established to provide the applicant with the skills and guidance to transition into a position ofindependence in a timely manner. The mentor Dr. Williams is a successfully funded researcher and leadingexpert in craniofacial biology and is thus well suited to oversee the applicants training. The advisory committeeincludes both internal and external members that will provide critical guidance and feedback on aspects ofcareer development and technical components of cranial bone tooth enamel cell culture bioinformatic andgene-editing biology. The committee also includes two young faculty members who will specifically assist theapplicant in components directly related to career transition. In addition courses in bioinformatics andconferences on bone and tooth development and biomineralization are included to facilitate these componentsof the training program. Second an adept research environment  the Department of Craniofacial Biology theUniversity of Colorado along with associated resources core facilities and faculty members not directlyinvolved in the applicants advisory committee  is established to provide assurance of the applicants success.Third a research project has been proposed to facilitate training of the applicant in new areas of biologyessential for his path to independence while simultaneously maintaining the key goals of improving dental oraland craniofacial health. Central to these goals are understanding the unique gene regulatory networks drivingcranial skeletal mineralization  a process that is well described in the mesoderm-derived trunk skeleton yetlacks clarity in the cranial skeleton owing to its unique developmental origins. To this end the researchproposal utilizes three aims to test the important hypothesis that Memo1 and Runx2 genetically integrate todrive mineralization of key craniodental structures including teeth and bones. Aim I will establish whetherMemo1 expression is directly regulated by RUNX2 in the context of in vivo cranial endochondral ossificationand in vitro amelogenesis. Aim II will more specifically determine the role of MEMO1 in cranial endochondralossification and its genetic integration with Runx2-II in this process. Finally Aim III will establish the role thesemolecules play in mineralization of the enamel layer during tooth development.

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Neurosciences","Heart failure (HF) is a devastating disease. Debilitation mortality and concomitant economic burdenassociated with HF all point to the need for new therapies to address this problem more effectively. Increasedpro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) in periphery and the central nervous system particularly tumor necrosisfactor- (TNF-) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of HF. However anti-TNF clinical trials targetingperipheral manifestations of HF have failed to exhibit beneficial significance indicating that the mechanisms ofTNF- have not been challenged. Our previous study discovered that TNF- increases incardiovascular/autonomic-related regions of the brain in a rat model of HF and contribute significantly tosympathetic excitation in that setting. More recently our preliminary data indicated that TACE a TNF-converting enzyme is upregulated in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of hypothalamus and subfornical organ(SFO) of the brain and can alter cardiovascular function and sympathetic drive in HF rats. Unlike othercytokines TNF- is initially produced as a transmembrane protein (tmTNF-). TACE is responsible for thecleavage of tmTNF- to release its mature form the soluble TNF- (sTNF-) to mediate inflammatory andimmune responses. Further evidence indicated that sTNF- binds predominantly to the TNF receptor 1(TNFR1) to elicit pro-inflammatory and toxic responses and that tmTNF- binds preferentially to the TNFreceptor 2 (TNFR2) to display an anti-inflammatory and protective role. This project will underline the role ofthe brain TACE in TNF-induced inflammatory mechanisms driving the neurohumoral activation in HF. Usinga multifaceted approach including electrophysiology molecular biology immunocytochemistry pharmacologyand biochemistry in sham-operated and HF rats this project will determine 1) whether TACE regulates thebalance between sTNF- and tmTNF- in SFO and PVN in HF and what cell types are involved; 2) whetherincreased TACE activity and/or decreased TNFR2 expression in brain contribute to the neurohumoralexcitation in HF; 3) whether inhibition of TACE or activation of TNFR2 in the brain has a beneficial effect oncardiac function and survival rate in HF. These studies will characterize a previously unrecognized role of brainTACE in neurohumoral activation in HF and will identify a novel anti-TNF target for pharmacologicalintervention of HF. Completion of this research project will provide important insights into the anti-cytokinetherapeutic strategy in HF and may also have implications in other cardiovascular disorders like hypertensionand metabolic diseases like obesity or diabetes.","Address;Adverse effects;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Antiinflammatory Effect;Attention;Automobile Driving;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemistry;Biological Process;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Circulation;Brain;Brain region;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cardiovascular system;Cleaved cell;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Disintegrins;Economic Burden;Electrophysiology (science);Enzymes;Equilibrium;Etanercept;Exhibits;Family;Functional disorder;Heart failure;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;Immune response;Industry;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Injections;Integral Membrane Protein;Intervention;Lead;Light;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Membrane;Metabolic Diseases;Metalloproteases;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Myocardial dysfunction;Neuraxis;Obesity;Pathogenesis;Patients;Peripheral;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacology;Play;Production;Rattus;Recombinants;Research Project Grants;Role;Severities;Subfornical Organ;Survival Rate;Systolic heart failure;TNF gene;TNF-alpha converting enzyme;TNFRSF1A gene;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor;Ventricular Function;Work;brain tissue;cell type;cytokine;enzyme activity;heart function;immunocytochemistry;improved;infliximab;insight;mortality;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;paraventricular nucleus;protective effect;receptor;response;therapeutic cytokines","Targeting TACE a novel approach to the treatment of sympathetic excitation in heart failure.","This project examines the role of brain TACE a TNF- converting enzyme in regulating neurohumoralactivation and cardiac function in a rat model of systolic heart failure.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences","Project SummaryResponses to stress are regulated by a network of limbic forebrain structures whereas dysfunction in theseneural systems following chronic conditions has been widely implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-relatedpsychiatric illness. To date there is virtually no information accounting for central effectors of chronic stress-induced endocrine and behavioral modifications nor has there been any attempt to rescue normal functionafter chronic stress. Work in the field implicates the medial prefrontal cortex in providing top-down inhibitorycontrol over hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus(PVH) during acute stress via a disynaptic pathway involving GABAergic neurons in the bed nuclei of the striaterminalis (BST). However no information is currently available regarding the neural circuit mechanisms in thegenesis of exaggerated HPA responses upon subsequent exposure to novel challenges (i.e. sensitization).Additionally our preliminary data suggest that BST plays a broader role in coordinating both endocrine andbehavioral coping responses during a variety of challenges (e.g. tail suspension forced swim shock probedefensive burying tests) via dissociable pathways involving the PVH and periaqueductal gray area (PAG).Therefore our objective in this proposal is to manipulate these circuit elements to elucidate the mechanisms ofchronic stress-induced HPA sensitization and shift toward passive behavioral responses to subsequentchallenges. These studies will combine optogenetics and neurophysiology to build on our existing strengths inanatomical and behavioral approaches to manipulate putative stress modulatory networks in rats. In Aim 1 wewill interrogate the divergent pathways from BST to PVH and PAG in mediating the maladaptive HPA andbehavioral changes following chronic variable stress exposure. Aim 2 will examine whether diminishedprefrontal control over descending pathways to BST and/ or PAG account for chronic stress-inducedmaladaptive HPA and behavioral alterations. This work will advance our thinking of how different features ofstress responses are coordinated and will provide a clearer picture of how dysfunction in modulatory braincircuits may lead to chronic stress-related dysfunction of multiple systems as is common in psychiatricillnesses such as depression.","Accounting;Acute;Address;Adrenal Glands;Affect;Anatomy;Animals;Area;Axon;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Brain;Chronic;Chronic stress;Data;Development;Disease;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Endocrine;Event;Exposure to;Functional disorder;Future;Glutamates;Goals;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Impairment;Intervention;Knowledge;Lead;Medial;Mediating;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Mood Disorders;Nervous system structure;Neuronal Dysfunction;Neurons;Outcome;Output;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pituitary Gland;Pituitary-Adrenal System;Play;Predisposition;Prefrontal Cortex;Prosencephalon;Rattus;Recording of previous events;Research;Response to stimulus physiology;Rodent;Role;Shock;Stress;Structure;Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region;Swimming;System;Systemic disease;Tail Suspension;Testing;Thinking;Validation;Work;acute stress;base;behavioral response;biological adaptation to stress;coping;experience;experimental study;midbrain central gray substance;neural circuit;neuronal circuitry;neurophysiology;novel;optogenetics;paraventricular nucleus;relating to nervous system;response;virtual","Neural Circuit Basis of Maladaptive Endocrine and Behavioral Responses Following Chronic Stress","Project NarrativeDysfunction of neural systems that normally promote adaptive coping during stress may increase susceptibilityto psychiatric illnesses.

"Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular","Project Summary / AbstractVascular occlusive disease remains a critical cardiovascular health issue with about 500000 percutaneouscoronary and 50000 peripheral balloon angioplasties performed annually in the US alone. Hemodynamicallyrelevant restenoses through neointimal hyperplasia occur in 10 to 30% of patients. Vascular smooth musclecell (VSMC) migration significantly contributes to neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. VSMC migrationis a Ca2+-dependent process; migrating cells must maintain cytosolic Ca2+ gradients and create local Ca2+pulses near the leading edge likely to accomplish dynamic cytoskeletal turnover. Mitochondria are one of themajor buffers of intracellular Ca2+ in VSMC and participate in localized Ca2+ responses. In other cell types cellmigration is dependent upon mitochondrial localization to the leading edge. Thus we propose thatmitochondria provide localized control of Ca2+ transients serving to facilitate VSMC migration. Previous workfrom our group established that the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is akey regulator of VSMC cell migration and proliferation. In more recent studies we discovered that CaMKII ispresent and active in the mitochondrial matrix where it is believed to promote mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ influx.In preliminary studies mitoCaMKII inhibition in VSMC in a novel transgenic model developed in our laboratoryblocks neointimal hyperplasia in vivo. Moreover mitoCaMKII inhibition blocks mitochondrial Ca2+ uptakemitochondrial mobility and VSMC migration. These data position mitochondrial CaMKII (mitoCaMKII) as agatekeeper of mitochondrial function and of key VSMC phenotypes relevant for neointimal hyperplasia. In thisthis application we will directly test our working hypothesis that mitoCaMKII inhibition blocks mitochondrialmatrix Ca2+ uptake thereby affecting mitochondrial mobility and VSMC migration and ultimately neointimalhyperplasia. We will test our working hypothesis in two aims: 1. Determine whether mitoCaMKII in VSMCcontrols neointimal formation through regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and 2. Dissect thepathways and mechanisms by which mitoCaMKII controls VSMC migration. Studies will include in vivoanalysis of neointimal formation using novel transgenic models of mitoCaMKII inhibition or overexpression andin vitro imaging of localized Ca2+ dysregulation including ER/mitochondrial Ca2+ transition Ca2+ waves andflickers as well as analysis of cytoskeleton and focal adhesion turnover. Moreover novel pathways that linkmitochondrial matrix Ca2+ uptake to VSMC migration will be tested. It is anticipated that the successfulcompletion of the proposed studies will provide mechanistic insight into how changes in mitochondrial functionlead to VSMC migration and neointimal formation. Such knowledge could lead to first-in-class mitochondria-targeted therapies for vascular disease in particular neointimal hyperplasia.","Affect;Balloon Angioplasty;Blood Vessels;Buffers;Cancer cell line;Cardiovascular system;Cause of Death;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Complement;Coronary;Crossbreeding;Cytoskeleton;Data;Disease;Epigenetic Process;Event;Focal Adhesions;Fostering;Future;Gatekeeping;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Hyperplasia;Image;Impairment;In Vitro;Injury;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Link;Medicine;Mission;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Matrix;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Myosin ATPase;Outcome;Paclitaxel;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiologic pulse;Positioning Attribute;Process;Public Health;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Role;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stents;Stroke;Supporting Cell;Testing;Transgenic Model;Transgenic Organisms;United States National Institutes of Health;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Work;base;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;cardiovascular health;cell motility;cell type;hemodynamics;improved;in vivo;insight;mTOR Inhibitor;migration;novel;novel strategies;overexpression;prevent;response;restenosis;targeted treatment;treatment strategy;uptake;vascular injury;vascular smooth muscle cell migration","Mitochondrial CaMKII drives smooth muscle migration and neointimal hyperplasia","Project NarrativeThe proposed research aims at understanding key mechanisms in the response to vascular injury with theultimate goal of developing novel treatment strategies.

"Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYCandida albicans is an important opportunistic pathogen for people living with HIV/AIDS and primarily causesmucosal diseases such as oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and esophageal candidiasis (EC). In the era ofantiretroviral therapy (ART) C. albicans remains the most common fungal pathogen affecting those withHIV/AIDS and OPC is one of the most common infections in HIV patients with mild-to-moderateimmunosuppression (CD4 counts 200-500). The pathogenesis of OPC can be separated into two stages: 1)C. albicans adhesion/biofilm formation on the mucosal surface and 2) hyphae-mediated invasion of theepithelium and submucosal stroma with concomitant inflammation and tissue damage. Thus OPCpathogenesis is dependent on three of the most important mediators of C. albicans virulence: adhesion biofilmformation and filamentation. Although each of these factors has been studied using specific C. albicansmutants no systematic large-scale genetic analysis of OPC pathogenesis has been undertaken. The goal ofthis application is to define and characterize the transcriptional networks that underlay the ability of C. albicansto cause oral disease. Recently we have pioneered the use of complex haploinsufficiency (CHI)-based geneticinteraction analysis to understand the function of complex genetic networks. Here we propose to use CHIanalysis to test the hypothesis that Cbk1 represents a master regulator of transcriptional processes critical forOPC pathogenesis (Aim 1). In addition to this intra-pathway analysis we will perform the first large-scalegenetic screens for and CHI analyses of TF networks required for murine oral candidiasis (Aim 2) and in vivofilamentation (Aim 3). The screen in Aim 3 will utilize our novel intra-vital imaging assay to quantitativelydifferentiate between yeast and filamentous cells in the sub-epithelial stroma of mice.

Hearing impaired (HI) listeners with similar profiles often showdifferent outcomes. Correlational studies show that signal quality (audibility frequency separation) is related tooutcomes. However equally important are factors like device experience cognition and brain function. It isunclear how these adaptations cognitive resources or brain areas improve perception. This project tacklesthis by leveraging mechanisms and measures from cognitive science that describe how sound is mapped tomeaning focusing on the issue of time. Since speech unfolds over time there are ambiguous periods whenthe input is compatible with many words. For example at the onset of butter the signal could match bump butand buck. Normal hearing (NH) listeners manage this ambiguity by immediately activating multiple words whichcompete dynamically over time. For HI listeners this natural ambiguity may be more problematic and manageddifferently. We assess the dynamics of word recognition with an eye-tracking paradigm that traces how thiscompetition unfolds over several hundred milliseconds. Prior work suggests cochlear implant (CI) users tunethese dynamics differently than NH listeners; these differences are correlated with outcomes and may helpcope with poor input. This project asks why these competition processes differ in HI listeners. Are suchdifferences a poor version of typical language processing imposed by degraded input? Or are they acompensatory adaptation for coping with uncertainty? To answer this question in a way that translates to thereal-world Aim 1 moves beyond isolated words to examine sentences where factors like semantics constrainthis competition. Aim 2 uses a longitudinal study to link differences in competition to peripheral auditoryfunction (Project 2) listening effort (Project 1) and cortical processing (Project 3); and Aim 3 complements thiswith laboratory studies of adaption. Aim 4 examines how HI listeners fuse information from different types ofinput for example from aided acoustic hearing and a CI. All aims leverage natural variation in multiple types ofHI listeners (standard CIs acoustic+electric CI configurations and hearing aids) to investigate how differencesin the peripheral input impact the mechanisms of language processing.","Acoustics;Adopted;Area;Auditory;Brain;Butter;Clinical Research;Cochlear Implants;Cochlear implant procedure;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive Science;Complement;Complement 3;Correlation Studies;Cues;Devices;Ensure;Environment;Exhibits;Eye Movements;Face;Frequencies;Funding;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Hybrids;Impairment;Investigation;Iowa;Laboratories;Laboratory Study;Language;Lead;Learning;Link;Longitudinal Studies;Maps;Measures;Modeling;Noise;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Pathway interactions;Perception;Performance;Peripheral;Problem Solving;Process;Resources;Running;Semantics;Signal Transduction;Speech;Speech Perception;System;Time;Training;Translating;Uncertainty;Variant;Visual;Work;clinical practice;cognitive ability;coping;experience;hearing impairment;improved;improved outcome;language comprehension;language processing;lexical;lexical processing;millisecond;normal hearing;outcome prediction;remediation;sample fixation;signal processing;sound;speech accuracy;standardize measure;visual tracking","Cognitive Mechanisms of Language Processing","NARRATIVE  PROJECT 4We seek a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms by which hearing impaired listeners (includingcochlear implant and hearing aid users) map the auditory signal to meaning and how these mechanisms adaptto compensate for poor input.

The central goal of this project is to understand thecognitive and neural bases of hearing impaired listeners' abilities to detect complex auditory objects insimulations of noisy real-life environments. Work on normal hearing listeners has identified fundamentalcognitive and cortical mechanisms for perceiving auditory objects in noisy backgrounds and there areestablished cortical mechanisms for perceiving of speech in noise. In both cases mechanisms in auditorycortex are active during the abstraction of complex objects from noisy backgrounds and provide input intonetworks that allow further perceptual attentional and semantic analysis. These brain networks have not yetbeen characterized in hearing impaired listeners and it is not clear if auditory object detection contributes tospeech perception in a way that cannot be predicted by peripheral hearing alone. Aim 1 applies a newmeasure of the ability to detect complex (non-speech) auditory objects in noise and relates this to morestandard speech in noise perception in a range of hearing impaired listeners. This is done to determinewhether of speech in noise in hearing impaired listeners depends on mechanisms for cross-frequency groupingand examine how that dependence differs in patients with impaired acoustic hearing or a CI. Aim 2 relatesbrain activation (measured with high density EEG) to performance on these two tasks and measures ofperipheral auditory function to identify differences in cortical activation in impaired listeners that are not solely afunction of their poor peripheral input. Aim 3 conducts a longitudinal study to examine changes in the corticalsystems for detecting generic auditory objects and speech in noise. We examine the same patients beforeimplantation and 1 3 6 and 24 months post implantation using a combination of EEG Positon EmissionTomography (to achieve spatially precise measure of cortical activation)and behavioral measures. This willdetermine how the abilities to detect complex objects and speech in background noiseand the neuralsubstrates that support these abilitieschanges with experience with a hearing device.","Accounting;Acoustics;Attention;Auditory;Auditory area;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cochlear Implants;Cochlear implant procedure;Cognitive;Complex;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Dependence;Detection;Devices;Electroencephalography;Environment;Frequencies;Goals;Grouping;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Impairment;Inferior;Intervention;Iowa;Lead;Life;Link;Location;Longitudinal Studies;Measurement;Measures;Noise;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Parietal Lobe;Participant;Pathway Analysis;Patients;Performance;Peripheral;Positron-Emission Tomography;Principal Investigator;Process;Semantics;Sensory;Source;Speech;Speech Perception;Superior temporal gyrus;System;Temporal Lobe;Testing;Time;Training;Work;abstracting;base;behavior measurement;behavioral study;blood flow measurement;clinical outcome measures;density;experience;frontal lobe;hearing impairment;hearing range;implantation;improved;neuromechanism;noise perception;normal hearing;perceptual organization;preservation;programs;relating to nervous system;remediation;signal processing;simulation;source localization;speech in noise;success;tomography","Project 3: Central Auditory Integration and Plasticity","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last First Middle):Project NarrativeThe central aim of this project is to understand the cognitive and neural bases of hearing impaired listenersability to detect complex auditory objects in noisy environments arguably the most important deficit faced bysuch listeners.

Today CIs have been designed specifically topreserve cochlear structures and many recipients enjoy preservation of acoustic hearing in their implanted earfollowing surgery. Speech processors are also available that allow coordinated delivery of sound via bothacoustic and electric stimulation modes. We refer to this group of CI users as A+E listeners and they are thefocus of this proposal.Two specific aims will be addressed. Aim 1 starts with the observation that average performance levels for thisgroup of CI users are good but notes that there is still considerable variance in outcome for individuals. Thestudies included in this proposal are designed to identify reasons for that variance in outcome. We hypothesizethat the status of the peripheral auditory system may be particularly important in determining outcome for A+Elisteners. A series of electrophysiologic measures are proposed that we will use to characterize the responseof the auditory periphery to both acoustic and electrical stimulation. The methods we propose to use are novel.In our previous work we have used electrical stimulation to assess the status of the auditory periphery.Electrical stimulation bypasses the cochlear hair cells. The studies included in this proposal will use acousticstimulation and an electrode located inside the cochlea to record neural activity from both cochlear hair cellsand from the auditory nerve. These responses to acoustic stimulation will complement measures of how theauditory nerve responds to electrical stimulation and the result will be a more comprehensive characterizationof the integrity and function of the peripheral auditory system. We also propose for the first time to incorporateresults of genetic testing into the model will use for predicting outcome. One series of experiments will focus onhow spectral and temporal cues are processed at the auditory periphery and those results serve asindependent variables in a multivariate regression analysis that will be used to determine the independentcontributions of multiple factors to speech perception in noise.Our second aim will focus on using our expanded battery of electrophysiologic recording methods to help usunderstand the reason that a subset of A+E listeners experience loss of their acoustic hearing often monthsafter surgery. We will follow each study participant closely and correlate changes in behavioral thresholds withchanges in electrode impedance current flow patterns within the cochlea and electrophysiologic measures ofthe response of the peripheral auditory system to both acoustic and electric stimulation. Our hypothesis is thatchanges over time in these metrics will inform theories regarding why this delayed loss of acoustic hearingtakes place and in turn suggest potential treatment options.OMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 03/16 Approved Through 10/31/2018) Page Continuation Format Page","Acoustic Nerve;Acoustic Stimulation;Acoustics;Address;Algorithm Design;Auditory;Auditory area;Auditory system;Behavioral;Bilateral;Bypass;Clinical Research;Cochlea;Cochlear Implants;Code;Complement;Complex;Cues;DNA;Ear;Ecology;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Electrophysiology (science);Evoked Potentials;Experimental Designs;Functional disorder;Genetic;Goals;Growth;Hair Cells;Health;Hearing;Implant;Individual;Iowa;Labyrinth;Light;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Mutation;Noise;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Participant;Pattern;Perception;Performance;Peripheral;Physiological;Play;Population;Principal Investigator;Procedures;Process;Property;Psychophysics;Regression Analysis;Residual state;Role;Sampling;Series;Signal Transduction;Source;Speech;Speech Perception;Structure;Synapses;System;Techniques;Technology;Telemetry;Testing;Time;Tissues;Work;base;design;electric impedance;experience;experimental study;functional status;ganglion cell;genetic testing;hearing impairment;implant design;language processing;neuroimaging;novel;outcome prediction;preservation;programs;relating to nervous system;response;round window;sound;spiral ganglion;theories;tool","Project 2:  Peripheral Electrophysiology","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last First Middle): Gantz Bruce J.PROJECT NARRATIVE  PROJECT 2Cochlear implant users with significant residual hearing are able to effectively combine electrical and acousticinformation but there is great variability observed in performance.

"Assistive Technology; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Hearing Loss; Prevention; Rehabilitation; Social Determinants of Health","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last First Middle): Gantz Bruce J.PROJECT SUMMARY  PROJECT 1The past 35 years of cochlear implant (CI) research have focused on outcomes primarily related to speechperception. Candidacy recently has extended into the less severely impaired population due to newer shorterimplants including hybrid (acoustic-plus-electric) designs. The potential for improvement/change in domainsother than speech perception can inform both policy and rehabilitative decision-making.Human ecology describes the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments.This concept considers that human behaviors must be studied from both the social and natural sciencevantage points. In hearing health care success with intervention is as much related to the anatomy/physiologyof the individual as it is to the environmental and personal (i.e. ecological) factors that make each individualunique from the next. The overall goal of this project is to determine the impact of intervention on user'shearing-related functions and disability in their natural environments (i.e. real-world outcomes) and to clarifywhat ecological factors as well as perceptual factors affect these real-world outcomes.To date most cochlear implant (CI) research has focused on determining the effect of anatomical andphysiological factors on laboratory outcomes such as speech perception. We recognize however that thereal-world outcomes exhibit great heterogeneity which is likely due in part to the broader range ofenvironmental and personal contextual (i.e. ecological) underpinnings in the hearing impaired population. Ashas been the case with hearing aids (HA) much variance can be accounted for by examining individualecological factors. Very little is understood about (1) the characteristics of ecological factors of the CIpopulation (2) the influence that ecological factors have on the heterogeneity of real-world outcomes of thispopulation and (3) how this influences changes over time. With the expanded indications for CI quantifying theecological factors that parlay into real-world outcomes in CI is critical because real-world outcomes ultimatelydetermine societal burden and policy. Furthermore because traditional retrospective self-reported outcomemeasures are often subject to recall bias we will in addition to standardized questionnaires and a data-loggingfeature on the processors use a smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) system tocapture users' real-time experiences in situ (i.e. in natural environment). This will allow for measurement of thecharacteristics of listening environments in addition to subjective assessment of listening difficulty/ease. TwoAims have been designed to study the influence of ecological factors have on outcomes of listeners with a CI.Aim 1. To characterize environmental factors that are relevant to listening and communication for participantsin each intervention group (Aim 1A) and to determine the effect of intervention on these factors (Aim 1B).Aim 2. To document the effect of intervention on real-world outcomes (Aim 2A) and determine to what extentenvironmental personal and perceptual factors moderate those outcomes (Aim 2B) over time (Aim 2C).","Acoustics;Affect;Anatomy;Auditory;Behavior;Cellular Phone;Characteristics;Classification;Clinical Research;Cochlear Implants;Cochlear implant procedure;Cognition;Communication;Data;Decision Making;Detection;Ear;Ecological momentary assessment;Ecology;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Exhibits;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Heterogeneity;Human;Hybrids;Impairment;Implant;Improve Access;In Situ;Individual;International;Intervention;Iowa;Laboratories;Life Style;Literature;Measurement;Mental Depression;Music;Natural Sciences;Noise;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Participant;Patient Self-Report;Perception;Personality;Physiological;Physiology;Policies;Population;Predictive Factor;Principal Investigator;Procedures;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Rehabilitation therapy;Research;Residual state;Role;Signal Transduction;Social Environment;Social Sciences;Social isolation;Socialization;Sound Localization;Speech;Speech Perception;Speech Sound;Standardization;Stimulus;System;Time;Work;base;built environment;design;disability;experience;genetic information;group intervention;hearing impairment;improved;instrument;interest;intervention effect;lexical processing;novel;preservation;primary outcome;programs;social;speech in noise;success;tool","Iowa Cochlear Implant Clinical Research Center VII","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last First Middle): Gantz Bruce J.PROJECT NARRATIVE  PROJECT 1To date most cochlear implant (CI) research has focused on determining the effect of anatomical andphysiological factors on laboratory outcomes such as speech and music perception.

"No NIH Category available","Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last First Middle): Gantz Bruce J.PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERVIEWHearing loss is a pervasive problem and according to statistics from the NIDCD/NIH website it is estimatedthat it affects nearly 37.5 million Americans aged 18 years and older. While remediation with hearing aids andcochlear implants has assisted those with moderate to profound loss noise interferes with the ability tounderstand speech. Our research has identified the important advantage of combining acoustic+electricspeech processing (A+E) to facilitate improved hearing in noise. Application of A+E processing has improvedoutcomes of cochlear implants in quiet and noise but there is significant individual variability in outcomemeasures among subjects. To address these issues this application requests continuation of the IowaCochlear Implant Clinical Research Center. In this proposal we will investigate hearing and auditory perceptionusing studies that explore the mechanisms of electrical acoustic and A+E hearing from the auditory peripheryto the cortex including measures of cortical (re)organization and higher order language processing. Equallyimportant we also explore human ecologyfactors in the person and in the environment that can mediate orimpede successful communication and can be modified by A+E speech processing. Our overarching goal ofthis competitive renewal is to apply basic and cognitive neuroscience methodologies to assist us in addressingthese fundamental questions about how individuals use both acoustic and electric auditory information. Fourresearch projects Human Ecology Peripheral Electrophysiology Central Auditory Integration and CognitiveDynamics of Language Processing an administrative and patient care/technical support cores are proposed.The overall objectives are to examine the impact that A+E processing function has on real-life socializationcognition and quality of life issues and to evaluate auditory processing from the periphery to cortical andhigher level processing. We plan to study 200 newly implanted adult subjects with A+E hearing preservationimplants 50 subjects that use a hearing aid 50 normal hearing subjects and a combination of 300 previouslyimplanted subjects with A+E bimodal or single CIs that participate in our research registry.

"Genetics; Neurosciences","Ongoing advances in the elucidation of protein structures are leading to the production of large volumes ofhigh-resolution data in increasingly native environments. However especially in the case of transmembraneproteins experimental options for high-resolution functional analyses remain limited and thus the usefulnessof the structures in understanding human neurological diseases likewise remains limited. Moreover thestructures that are obtained represent single static snapshots of proteins although these likely have multipleconformations of functional significance. Thus there is a growing need among the ion channel and membranebiophysics community which is supported by the NINDS for reagents that directly report on the functionalityand dynamics of membrane proteins in live cells. An elegant solution to these problems is nonsensesuppression a method that makes it possible to encode any type of synthetic amino acid at a site of interestwithin a protein. These so-called unnatural amino acids can take the form of residues with single atomsubstitutions or side-chains with novel fluorescent properties. Although multiple experimental avenues for theencoding of unnatural amino acids exist each is associated with significant technical challenges. As such thispowerful approach remains inaccessible to most investigators studying molecular neuroscience. In 2014 inresponse to numerous inquiries by other investigators the Ahern lab at the University of Iowa (UI) set out tosimplify the dissemination of acylated orthogonal tRNAs key components in nonsense suppression forexperiments involving eukaryotic membrane proteins. To this end we made improvements to the underlyingchemistry making it more robust and allowing for the encoding of a more chemically diverse set of aminoacids. In addition these new reagents display vastly improved stability profiles thus allowing for easy shippingto laboratories throughout the U.S. With our reagents and guidance a number of new user groups havesuccessfully applied this previously difficult approach to a variety of membrane proteins relevant to the NINDSmission. Overall these efforts have produced a high-functioning collaborative outreach service The Facilityfor Atomic Mutagenesis. This resource will provide broad access to custom reagents for nonsensesuppression and this facility is able to quickly adapt or design synthetic approaches to meet the interests of anapplication by new users. As the technologies become more standardized and our user group expands we willscale accordingly taking advantage of infrastructure present with the UI Carver College of Medicine and localindustrial partners such as Integrated DNA Technologies. These collaborations will ultimately support moreefficient dissemination of these research tools to answer diverse questions in molecular neuroscience. Theiruse will be buoyed by a growing user base annual training seminars web-based forums and publishedprotocols in open-access peer-reviewed journals. Our Advisory Board  Kossiakoff Perozo Koide Nakamoto will ensure efficient stewardship of key resources and the alignment of our strategic vision to NINDS.","Amino Acids;Biophysics;Caliber;Cells;Chemicals;Chemistry;Chicago;Collaborations;Communities;Core Facility;Custom;DNA;Data;Ensure;Environment;Generations;Goals;Human;Industrialization;Infrastructure;Integral Membrane Protein;Ion Channel;Iowa;Journals;Laboratories;Letters;Medicine;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Methods;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Mutagenesis;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Neurosciences;Online Systems;Optics;Peer Review;Piper;Potassium Channel;Production;Property;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Reagent;Records;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Resolution;Resources;Science;Services;Shipping;Side;Site;Sodium Channel;Standardization;Structure;Technical Expertise;Techniques;Technology;Training;Transfer RNA;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Virginia;Vision;Work;base;college;cost;design;experience;experimental study;improved;interest;member;nervous system disorder;next generation;novel;novel therapeutics;outreach services;professor;protein structure;response;success;tool;unnatural amino acids;voltage;wiki","The Facility for Atomic Mutagenesis","The proposed efforts will result in the efficient dissemination of reagents that will enable end users toperform atomic mutagenesis and to encode next generation powerful optical probes to advance theunderstanding of membrane proteins.

"Diabetes; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease; Nutrition; Obesity","PROJECT SUMMARYIn the setting of obesity endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been identified as a prominent feature inmetabolic tissues in both animal models and in humans. To cope with ER stress cells activate the unfoldedprotein response (UPR) to mitigate stress. However failure of the UPR results in chronic unresolved stresscontributing to the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator ofobesity-associated inflammation. We recently demonstrated that NO-mediated protein modification (S-nitrosylation) impairs the RNase activity of inositol-requiring enzyme- (IRE1) resulting in unresolved ERstress and insulin resistance. Although nitric oxide synthase (NOS) provides the general intracellular NO poolsfor protein S-nitrosylation the rate of these modifications is also affected by the targeted removal of NO groupsby protein denitrosylation. Our strong preliminary data demonstrate that obesity impairs the activity of S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR a major denitrosylase) leading to elevated nitrosative stress in the liver.Furthermore deletion or overexpression of GSNOR directly regulates the S-nitrosylation state of IRE1 andER function in mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Notably liver-specific GSNOR overexpression amelioratedobesity-associated insulin resistance. However the molecular mechanism that underlies the regulation of ERhomeostasis by GSNOR-mediated denitrosylation signaling is unknown. We propose to test the centralhypothesis that obesity attenuates GSNOR-dependent protein denitrosylation resulting in elevated nitrosativestress in the ER that contributes to obesity-associated hepatic insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis wewill undertake 2 specific aims. In Aim 1 we will: 1) determine whether liver-specific GSNOR deletion impactshepatic insulin sensitivity and whole body glucose homeostasis using DIO mouse model; 2) establish whetherGSNOR regulates hepatic insulin action directly via modulation of UPR; and 3) assess the therapeutic potentialof enhancing hepatic GSNOR activity in obese mice by glutathione supplementation and enhancing cellularnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism. In Aim 2 we will: 1) profile the ER S-nitrosylationproteome and characterize the endogenous S-nitrosylation sites on IRE1; 2) address how GSNOR-mediateddenitrosylation signaling modulates the IRE1 RNase activity; and 3) establish how GSNOR-mediateddenitrosylation signaling affects IRE1 interactome formation. The approaches used here are innovativecombining the use of cellular and molecular biological analysis biochemical analysis for S-nitrosylated proteinselucidating the ER S-nitrosylation proteome protein-RNA interaction analysis and in vivo mouse metabolicprofiling. The mechanisms elucidated in this project will provide further understanding of how inflammatory andER stress pathways are integrated in the context of obesity-associated hepatic insulin resistance dyslipidemiaand ultimately type 2 diabetes. Insight into the mechanisms by which maladaptive organelle stress responsesdrive these pathologies should speed development of novel therapeutic targets for metabolic diseases.","Address;Affect;Animal Model;Attenuated;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biological;Butyric Acids;Cells;Chemicals;Chronic;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Dyslipidemias;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Enhancers;Enzymes;Excision;Failure;Functional disorder;Glutathione;Goals;Hepatic;Homeostasis;Human;Immunoprecipitation;Impairment;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inositol;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Laboratory Research;Liver;Maps;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Mission;Modification;Molecular;Mus;NOS2A gene;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;Nitric Oxide;Nitric Oxide Synthase;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obese Mice;Obesity;Organelles;Outcome;Output;Oxidoreductase;Pancreatic ribonuclease;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Production;Protein S;Proteins;Proteome;Proteomics;Public Health;RNA Processing;RNA Splicing;RNA-Protein Interaction;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Ribonucleases;Role;S-Nitrosoglutathione;Signal Transduction;Site;Speed;Stress;Supplementation;Testing;Therapeutic;Thinness;Tissues;United States National Institutes of Health;Up-Regulation;base;biological adaptation to stress;blood glucose regulation;crosslink;diabetic patient;diet-induced obesity;disability;endoplasmic reticulum stress;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;insulin sensitivity;mouse S-nitrosoglutathione reductase;mouse model;new therapeutic target;nitrosative stress;novel;obesity development;overexpression;protein complex;response","Integration of Inflammatory Signaling and the Unfolded Protein Response by Nitrosylation Signaling in Obesity","PROJECT NARRATIVE:The proposed project is relevant to public health in that it is expected to reveal a novel molecular mechanismthat underlies the association between inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis in the context ofobesity and to thereby advance knowledge in the fields of obesity and diabetes.

"Neurosciences","PROJECT SUMMARYBackground and Objectives: Synapses and circuits possess a robust capacity for stress response.They employ homeostatic regulatory mechanisms to maintain physiologically appropriate levels ofsynaptic output. Improved knowledge about homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity should lead to abetter understanding of neurological disorders that occur when synapse stability is lost. Using geneticand electrophysiological approaches at the model Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapsethree new factors required for the long-term homeostatic maintenance of NMJ function were uncov-ered: two tyrosine kinase signaling molecules residing in the muscle and one phospholipase C-(PLC) molecule residing in the neuron. The objective of this proposal is to understand how thesethree molecules integrate cell-cell signaling processes to maintain synapse stability throughout life.Specific Aims and Research Design: This project has three specific aims. The first two aims willdelineate how each respective tyrosine kinase drives a muscle-to-nerve signaling process to stabilizesynaptic activity over long periods of developmental time. The third aim will address how neuronalPLC integrates cell-cell signals at the synapse to autonomously control neuronal output. Each aimwill combine electrophysiology genetics pharmacology biochemistry and synapse imaging. A prima-ry assay for each aim will be to challenge NMJ function  usually by inhibiting glutamate receptors inthe muscle  and then to examine the NMJ by electrophysiology to check if it appropriately respondsto that challenge by releasing more glutamate from the neuron. By combining this electrophysiologicalapproach with synapse imaging it will be possible to identify manipulations that specifically impairsynapse function  as opposed to other parameters like synapse growth. The expected outcome is adetailed model of how synaptic tissues transmit cell-cell signals to maintain stable activity levels.Health Relatedness: Neurological disorders like epilepsy ataxia and migraine are associated withunstable neuronal function. Therefore understanding how synapses work to maintain stability on amolecular level could have profound implications for disorders with underlying neuronal instabilities.Yet the cell-cell signaling events that tightly control levels of synaptic output are poorly understood.The genetically tractable Drosophila NMJ employs homoestatic strategies to stabilize synapsefunction  such as altering levels of presynaptic calcium influx  that are shared by mammalian centralsynapses. Taking advantage of the molecular and genetic tools offered by the NMJ promises to shedlight on universally conserved mechanisms of how synapses maintain stable function throughout life.","Acute;Address;Ataxia;Biochemistry;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Calcium;Calcium Channel;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cell Signaling Process;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Development;Disease;Dissection;Drosophila genus;Drosophila melanogaster;Electrophysiology (science);Epilepsy;Event;Feedback;Fibroblast Growth Factor;Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Screening;Glutamate Receptor;Glutamates;Goals;Growth;Health;Homeostasis;Homologous Gene;Human;Image;Impairment;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Ligands;Light;Maintenance;Mediating;Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors;Migraine;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Molecular Genetics;Muscle;Myasthenia;NCAM1 gene;Nerve;Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules;Neuromuscular Junction;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Outcome;Output;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Phospholipase;Physiological;Physiology;Process;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;Proxy;Research;Research Design;Shapes;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Sirolimus;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxin;Vesicle;Work;base;biological adaptation to stress;effective therapy;fasciclin II;flexibility;improved;insight;intercellular communication;nervous system disorder;neuronal growth;neurotransmission;novel;phospholipase C beta;postsynaptic;presynaptic;programs;protein-tyrosine kinase c-src;quantum;response;stressor;synaptic function;therapy development;tool","Synaptic signals that drive the long-term maintenance of homeostatic neuroplasticity","PROJECT NARRATIVEHealth Relevance Narrative: Instability of neuronal function can be debilitating as evident from itsassociation with numerous neurological disorders  including forms of epilepsy ataxia and migraine.

"Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryCell-to-cell communication is crucial for growth and development as well as stress adaption inmulticellular organisms. Symplastic transport of signaling molecules between plant cells is mediated bymembrane-lined channels termed plasmodesmata (PD) whereas gap junctions play similar roles inmammals. Although pathogenic bacteria infect multicellular organisms it is unclear whether pathogenicbacteria exploit host cell-to-cell communication system to promote bacterial multiplication. To study host-pathogen interactions I explore Arabidopsis-Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000pathosystem. Typically almost all phytopathogenic bacteria are extracellular pathogen including PstDC3000. Bacterial pathogens are recognized by plants via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on theplasma membrane (PM) and nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR)-type receptors insidethe cell resulting in defense activation. To overcome plant defense Pst DC3000 injects 36 virulenceeffector proteins into host cells to exert their pathogenic activities. Using live cell imaging I discoveredthat Pst DC3000 effector protein HopO1-1 an active ADP-ribosyltransferase is targeted to the PD inArabidopsis. Ectopic expression of HopO1-1 in Arabidopsis leads to an increase in PD-dependentmolecular flux between plant cells. HopO1-1 is physically associated with Arabidopsis PD-locatedproteins (PDLP5 and PDLP7) in which expression of PDLP5 is upregulated by P. syringae infection andinvolved in plant innate immunity. To my knowledge HopO1-1 is the first bacterial effector to be identifiedas a PD-targeted protein. The finding raises the exciting possibility that bacterial pathogens delivereffectors such as HopO1-1 to modulate host PD function presumably by ADP-ribosylating PDLP5/7 tofacilitate bacterial spread and multiplication. The mentored phase of this proposed work will beconducted at Michigan State University under the guidance of Dr. Sheng Yang He. During this phase Iplan to (i) characterize the mode of action of HopO1-1 in modulating the host PD (ii) demonstrate thePD-dependent trafficking of bacterial effectors from the infected cells to the neighboring cells and (iii)establish systems in studying the dynamic host-microbe interactions at the initial infection sites. Dr. Hewill provide specific training in microbiology and plant-microbe interactions as well as guidance towardbecoming an independent researcher. In the independent phase I plan to study (i) the effect of HopO1-1in regulating PD aperture by controlling plant callose homeostasis (ii) the effect of HopO1-1 in themovement of plant signaling molecules and (iii) the functional role of HopO1-1 on creating bacterialinfection zones to establish the initial colonization in host tissues. The proposed project has potential incarving out a new research topic in bacterial pathogenesis and establishing new experimental protocolsin the study of cell-autonomous vs. non-cell-autonomous effects in host-bacterial interactions.","ADP Ribose Transferases;Arabidopsis;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Binding Sites;Cell Communication;Cell membrane;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Structures;Defect;Deposition;Development;Diffusion;Ectopic Expression;Gap Junctions;Genes;Genome;Growth and Development function;Health;Homeostasis;Human;Immune response;Infection;Knowledge;Leucine-Rich Repeat;Mammals;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Mentors;Messenger RNA;Michigan;Microbe;Microbiology;Modeling;Molecular;Mouse-ear Cress;Movement;Nanotubes;Natural Immunity;Nucleotides;Organism;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pattern;Pattern recognition receptor;Phase;Plant Diseases;Plant Proteins;Plants;Plasmodesmata;Play;Production;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Pseudomonas syringae;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Site;Small RNA;Stress;System;Testing;Tissues;Tomatoes;Training;Universities;Virulence;Work;Yang;callose;cell motility;defense response;disorder control;extracellular;food security;host-microbe interactions;human disease;live cell imaging;novel;novel therapeutics;pathogen;pathogenic bacteria;receptor;response;trafficking","A bacterial effector protein modulates host cell-to-cell communication","Project RelevancePathogenic bacterial infections pose major threads to global human health and crop production.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetic Testing; Genetics; Hearing Loss; Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rehabilitation","Project Summary Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns andaffects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial in developed countries a large fractionof hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic i.e. not associated with other phenotypes. During the prior granting period we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as acornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of MedicalGenetics has recognized the merit of this approach and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testingfor the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date tocorroborate this decision we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49genes and included missense variants (49%) copy number changes (18%) indels (18%) nonsensevariants (8%) splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%) making comprehensive genetictesting the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram. In this competitive renewal we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss byenhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust.

"Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Human Genome; Pediatric","Our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms for orofacial clefting (OFC) is limited by the fact that lessthan half of the heritable risk for this disorder has been assigned to specific genes. Towards identifyingpathological sequence variants among the many irrelevant ones detected in exomes and whole genomes ofpatients with this disorder an understanding of the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that govern thedevelopment of relevant tissues including the oral periderm is essential. We propose a systems biologyapproach to analyzing the periderm GRN. Using this approach in the past enabled us to identify three novelOFC risk genes. We will utilize two model organisms zebrafish and mouse because the peridermdifferentiation GRN appears to be highly conserved. In zebrafish the periderm differentiates very early inembryogenesis greatly facilitating the execution and interpretation of genetic perturbation analyses. Mouse onthe other hand has the advantage that its craniofacial anatomy is more similar to that of humans. In Aim 1 wewill determine the zebrafish periderm differentiation GRN using a state-of-the-art network inference algorithmNetProphet 2. This tool carries out both a coexpression analysis and a differential expression analysis. Inputdata sets will include RNA-seq expression profiles we will generate from loss-of-function (LOF) embryos for 4key transcription factors (TF) known to participate in this GRN. We will also identify the direct gene linkages ofthese key TFs in the periderm GRN. Finally we will test a novel candidate member of the periderm GRNTead by carrying out LOF tests in zebrafish thereby exploiting the strength of this model system. In Aim 2 wewill deduce the murine oral periderm differentiation GRN also using the NetProphet algorithm. Input datasetswill include expression profiles of periderm isolated from the palate shelves of wild-type mouse embryos andfrom heterozygous mutants of three key TFs: Irf6 Grhl3 and Tfap2a. For each of the mutant genotypes there isevidence of abnormal periderm differentiation. We will also identify murine periderm enhancer candidates bysorting GFP-positive and -negative cells from Krt17-gfp transgenic embryos performing ATAC-seq on bothpopulations and H3K27Ac ChIP-seq on cells from palate shelves and the nasal cavity. As in Aim 1 we willalso identify the direct gene linkages of the key TFs. We will train a machine learning algorithm on palateperiderm enhancers and use the resulting scoring function to prioritize OFC-associated SNPs near genes thatare expressed in periderm for those that are likely to directly affect risk for OFC. Finally we will perform allele-specific reporter assays on the top candidate SNPs from each of three loci. The expected outcome is a deeperunderstanding of the specific TFs and cis-regulatory elements that control differentiation of the periderm. Thiswill have a broad impact because it will enable human geneticists to prioritize candidate risk variants thatemerge from whole-exome and -genome sequencing analyses of OFC.","ATAC-seq;Affect;Algorithms;Alleles;Anatomy;Animal Model;Area;Binding;Binding Sites;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Models;CDH1 gene;Candidate Disease Gene;Cells;ChIP-seq;Code;DNA;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Development;Differentiated Gene;Disease;Elements;Embryo;Embryo Loss;Embryonic Development;Enhancers;Epidermis;Family;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genotype;Health;Heritability;Human;Individual;Knowledge;Link;Mammalian Genetics;Modeling;Mus;Nasal cavity;Oral;Outcome;Outcome Study;Palate;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Patients;Periderm;Population;Positioning Attribute;Public Domains;Regulator Genes;Regulatory Element;Reporter;Research;Risk;Risk Assessment;Role;Sampling;Series;Societies;Sorting - Cell Movement;Structural Congenital Anomalies;Structure;Systems Biology;Testing;Time;Tissue Differentiation;Tissues;Training;Transgenic Organisms;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Vertebrates;Wild Type Mouse;Zebrafish;base;clinically significant;craniofacial;differential expression;disorder risk;embryo tissue;exome;experimental study;genome sequencing;genome wide association study;improved;in vivo;loss of function;loss of function mutation;machine learning algorithm;member;model building;mutant;network models;novel;oral cavity epithelium;orofacial;orofacial cleft;paralogous gene;promoter;risk variant;support vector machine;tool;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;whole genome","Dissecting the transcriptional network governing differentiation of periderm","Orofacial is a common disease with a major impact on the affected individual their family andsociety.

"Neurosciences","The diversity of information encoding by neuronal circuits is regulated by the magnitude andlocation of Ca2+ entry though voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (CaV). In the mammalian centralnervous system the CaV2.1 channel is the critical subtype for CNS function since it is the mostefficient CaV2 subtype at triggering synaptic vesicle (SV) release. At the majority of synapsesCaV2.1 is present at higher levels and in closest proximity to SVs. During development synapsesbecome progressively more dependent on CaV2.1 due to selective reduction of CaV2.2 andCaV2.3. Neurons that signal with rapid and temporally precise action-potentials use Cav2.1exclusive synapses that have fast SV release kinetics. Additionally CaV2.1 is the dominant CaV2isoform associated with human CaV2 channelopathies that manifest in migraine epilepsy andataxia. Consistent with these findings dysregulation of SV release is a cause of these and severalother neurological disorders.Despite the importance of CaV2.1 in CNS function we know little about the molecular mechanismsthat regulate these CaV2.1 functions at the synapse. The calyx of Held a glutamatergicpresynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem utilizes rapid and temporally precise action potentialsignaling for encoding information. The calyx undergoes a developmental change from havingmultiple CaV2 subtypes to CaV2.1 exclusively. Since it is the sole input to drive post-synapticaction potential spiking and due to the ability to directly measure presynaptic Ca2+ currents andcorrelate them to SV release rate the calyx is an exceptional model for gaining mechanisticinsights into the presynaptic regulation of SV release and neuronal circuit output.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Hearing Loss; Human Genome; Rehabilitation","Project SummaryRecent advances in molecular technologies have enhanced our ability to identify genetic forms ofhearing losses with several important consequences. First the incorporation of genetic testinginto diagnostic algorithms has improved clinical care for deaf/hard-of-hearing persons. As moredeafness-associated genes are identified and incorporated into these panels furtherimprovements in clinical care will follow. Second because the genetic spectrum of non-syndromichearing loss (NSHL) has been better defined epidemiological studies of genetic deafness arepossible. These studies can be used to define knowledge gaps in our understanding of genetichearing loss. Third the identification of genes required for normal auditory function providesinsight into inner ear physiology at the molecular level. This insight is foundational to thedevelopment of novel therapies to treat deafness. During the 09/01/2014-08/31/2019 grant periodwe built on prior successes to advance our understanding of NSHL by focusing on two specificaims. Specific Aim 1: To identify genetic variants in regulatory elements of deafness-associated genes that contribute to NSHL Specific Aim 2. To compare simple and complex haplotypes in two well-defined populations  one with age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and one with normal hearing  to identify whether common variants in deafness-associated genes contribute to ARHLIn this competitive renewal our overarching goals are to further improve the clinical care of personswith hearing loss and provide a more robust foundation for therapies that target specific types ofgenetic hearing loss. We will achieve these goals by addressing current knowledge gaps asreflected in the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: We will identify novel deafness-associated genes Hypothesis: By leveraging whole genome sequencing and structured bioinformatic analyses in carefully selected cohorts we will optimize our ability to identify novel deafness-associated genes. The role of these genes in the biology of hearing and deafness will be validated using animals models of hearing loss. Specific Aim 2: We will resolve hidden heritability and complexity in known deafness- associated genes Hypothesis: A wealth of unidentified and unrecognized complexity lies at the variant level in known deafness-associated genes. Examples include the unrecognized effect of missense variants of low predicted pathogenicity the pathogenicity of synonymous variants and the pathogenicity of non-coding variants.The completion of these aims will refine our understanding of the biology of hearing and deafnessimprove clinical care for persons with hearing loss provide a better genetic foundation forprecision medicine for the hearing impaired and identify new targets for gene therapy fordeafness.","Address;Algorithms;Animal Model;Auditory;Bioinformatics;Biology;Complex;Development;Diagnostic;Family;Fostering;Foundations;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Grant;Haplotypes;Hearing;Heritability;Knowledge;Labyrinth;Molecular;Molecular Target;Outcome;Pathogenicity;Patients;Persons;Physiology;Population;Presbycusis;Regulatory Element;Research;Resources;Role;Structure;Technology;Untranslated RNA;Variant;base;clinical Diagnosis;clinical care;cohort;deaf;deafness;gene therapy;genetic deafness;genetic epidemiology;genetic testing;genetic variant;genome sequencing;hard of hearing;hearing impairment;hereditary hearing loss;improved;insight;normal hearing;novel;novel therapeutics;precision medicine;success;targeted treatment;whole genome","Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss A Collaborative Study","In Specific Aim 1 of this grant we will leverage the power of whole genome sequencing andstructured bioinformatic analysis to identify novel deafness-associated genes in carefully selectedpatient cohorts.

"Aging; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Hematology; Neurosciences; Stroke","Project SummaryStroke results in immense health and economic burden. Current strategies to improve stroke outcome isfibrinolysis of the clot with tissue plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy which involvesreperfusion of the ischemic region. However accumulating evidence suggests that cerebral reperfusion isoften accompanied by oxidative stress thrombosis and vascular inflammation which exacerbates neuronaldeath in the ischemic penumbra. There is currently no effective intervention available to protect the braindamage following reperfusion therapy. Clinical studies have shown a positive correlation between themassive influx of neutrophils and severity of injury following reperfusion. Integrin alpha9beta1 is highlyexpressed on neutrophils (relative to monocytes) upregulated upon activation and transmigration and isknown to stabilize neutrophil adhesion to activated endothelium in synergy with alpha2beta1 integrin. Themechanistic role of alpha9beta1 in stroke outcome is not explored yet. Utilizing novel mutant strains in pilotstudies we found that alpha9beta1 exacerbates stroke outcome by modulating thrombosis and vascularinflammation. Following updated Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) pre-clinicalguidelines and compelling pilot data we propose to test the innovative hypothesis that integrin alpha9beta1contributes to ischemic stroke exacerbation in stroke models with comorbidities and therapeutic targetingalpha9beta1 will improve stroke outcome by limiting thrombosis and inflammation. To accomplish this wewill utilize complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches state-of-the-art intravital microscopymagnetic resonance imaging laser speckle imaging and follow current STAIR/RIGOR guidelines. Aging andbiological sex are key determinants that influence stroke outcome. We will determine whether targetingalpha9beta1 will improve stroke outcome in the context of biological sex and aging so that the observedeffect is generalizable to the broader context. This project may have significant clinical implications sinceunderstanding the mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to reperfusion injury in stroke models withcomorbidities may provide new therapeutic interventions to treat ischemic stroke.","Adhesions;Aging;Alteplase;Animal Model;Binding;Biological Aging;Blood Platelets;Blood capillaries;Brain Injuries;Cell Adhesion;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Cerebrum;Clinical;Clinical Research;Coagulation Process;Complex;Data;Deposition;Economic Burden;Endothelium;Environmental sludge;Evaluation;Evolution;Exhibits;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fab Immunoglobulins;Fibrin;Fibrinolysis;Fibronectins;Free Radicals;Functional disorder;Genetic;Guidelines;Hour;Human;Hyperlipidemia;Industry;Infarction;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Injury;Integrin alpha2beta1;Integrins;Intervention;Ischemia;Ischemic Penumbra;Ischemic Stroke;Laser Speckle Imaging;Ligands;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mechanics;Mediating;Modeling;Mus;Myelogenous;Neurologic;Neurologic Deficit;Neuronal Injury;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Patients;Peptides;Pharmacology;Pilot Projects;Predisposition;Randomized;Reperfusion Injury;Reperfusion Therapy;Research;Role;Severities;Stroke;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombectomy;Thrombosis;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Update;Wild Type Mouse;biological sex;comorbidity;diet-induced obesity;effective intervention;efficacy testing;extracellular;genetic approach;health economics;high risk;human subject;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;integrin alpha9 beta1;intravital microscopy;migration;monocyte;multiphoton microscopy;mutant;nanoparticle;neuron loss;neutrophil;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;pre-clinical;response;sex;stroke model;stroke outcome;stroke risk;stroke therapy;synergism;systemic inflammatory response;therapeutic target;thromboinflammation;thrombolysis;vascular inflammation","Novel therpeautic interventions to treat ischemic stroke","Project NarrativeUtilizing myeloid and neutrophil-specific alpha9beta1 deficient mice the proposed studies will define the novelrole of alpha9beta1 in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke serious health and economic problem in theUnited States.

"Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Health Disparities; Minority Health","PROJECT SUMMARYConventional biomedical research targets the etiology of individual aging-related diseases. Yet chronic diseasesin old age rarely come in isolation and thus even dramatic advances in disease-specific treatments will haveminimal impact on the extension of disease-free years. An alternative that is likely to have a far greater payoff isto focus on their common risk factor increased age to understand how loss of the youthful state leads toincreased disease risk. The 2020 C. elegans Metabolism Aging Pathogenesis Stress and Small RNAs(MAPS 2020) is a bi-annual meeting that traditionally brings together leading researchers studying differentaspects of aging biology in a single model organism. MAPS 2020 will leverage this strength and (i) provide aplatform for presentation of predominantly unpublished cutting edge-discoveries in aging from establishedand new investigators (ii) expand the horizons of the field and encourage out-of-the-box thinking byincorporation of new topics and a variety of innovative formats in each session (iii) provide opportunitiesfor postdoc and graduate-student trainees especially women and under-represented minorities (URMs) topresent their research (iv) facilitate interaction mentoring and networking for new faculty trainees andestablished faculty through the introduction of two initiatives. The 2020 meeting roster thus far includes confirmed Invited speaker presentations from 42 renownedscientists (15 women (38%) 5 international). Seven out of the confirmed 11 session chairs are rising-star womenin aging research (64%). The 2020 Conference Schedule incorporates formats that encourage our statedemphasis of promoting new investigators and trainees. The majority (72%; 37/52) of the invitees have notspoken at this meeting in the last four years and amongst them more than a third (21/52) are invitees tothis meeting for the first time. The meeting schedule is designed to increase cross-participation and visibility ofnew faculty post-doctoral trainees and graduate-students. We include two innovative initiatives: a strategicPaired-Mentoring Initiatives of young faculty with senior scientists and a Cutting-Edge Concepts in GeroscienceInitiative to bring new concepts and out-of-the-box concepts to aging research. Through this application we are requesting funds to support the attendance of the invited speakers aswell as the investigators at various career stages from graduate students and post-docs to newly-independentfaculty who will be participating in the meeting. We propose allocating 55% of the funds from this grantspecifically to support attendance of female scientists and URMs. We plan to offer on-site child-care servicestravel and lodging to the meeting attendees to facilitate participation of young scientists and those with familyresponsibilities and to make the meeting fully accessible to individuals with disabilities.","Age;Aging;Animal Model;Biological Models;Biological Process;Biology of Aging;Biomedical Research;Caenorhabditis elegans;Child Care;Chronic Disease;Communities;Disabled Persons;Discipline;Disease;Etiology;Faculty;Family;Female;Fertilization;Foundations;Funding;Geroscience;Goals;Grant;Individual;Intention;International;Knowledge;Lightning;Mentors;Metabolism;Oral;Pathogenesis;Physiological;Postdoctoral Fellow;Research;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Schedule;Scientist;Senior Scientist;Site;Small RNA;Stress;Targeted Research;Thinking;Time;Travel;Underrepresented Minority;Universities;Wisconsin;Woman;care systems;career;design;disorder risk;frontier;graduate student;human old age (65+);innovation;insight;interdisciplinary collaboration;meetings;mortality;novel;posters;programs;symposium","Metabolism Aging Pathogenesis Stress and Small RNAs Meeting","PROJECT NARRATIVEAging is a fundamental biological process that underlies nearly every major cause of disease and mortality.

"Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases","Project Summary/AbstractA critical barrier to developing a cure for HIV-1 infection is the long-lived viral reservoir in cells due toviral latency. Many host proteins regulate HIV-1 gene expression and viral latency. By reducingintracellular dNTP levels the host protein SAMHD1 inhibits HIV-1 replication in myeloid cells and restingCD4+ T-cells cell types that are important for HIV-1 latency. Patients with homozygous SAMHD1mutations experience autoimmune diseases but the functions and mechanisms of SAMHD1 inmodulating inflammation and immunity remain unclear. Despite extensive studies of the mechanismsunderlying SAMHD1-mediated restriction of virus replication it is unknown whether and how SAMHD1regulates antiviral innate immune responses. Here we aim to address two key questions: (a) What arethe mechanisms of SAMHD1 in modulating the innate immune response to HIV-1 infection? (b) Howdoes SAMHD1 affect HIV-1 gene expression?Our new findings demonstrated that SAMHD1 suppresses innate immune responses to viral infectionsand inflammatory stimuli by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) activation and type I interferon(IFN-I) induction through distinct mechanisms. We discovered that SAMHD1 interacts with key proteinsin the NF-B and IFN-I pathways allowing it to act as a multifaceted repressor of innate immunesignaling. We also found that SAMHD1 impairs HIV-1 gene expression and reactivation of viral latency inprimary CD4+ T-cells. NF-B is critical for HIV-1 gene transcription and transcriptional inhibition of viralgene expression is the main mechanism of HIV-1 latency. Our central hypothesis is that SAMHD1modulates HIV-1 antiviral immunity and viral gene expression by suppressing NF-B activation IFN-Iinduction and viral transcription. We designed three specific aims to test this hypothesis. Aim 1.Elucidate the mechanisms by which SAMHD1 suppresses NF-B activation in HIV-1 infection; Aim 2.Define the mechanisms by which SAMHD1 suppresses IFN-I induction during HIV-1 infection; Aim 3.Investigate the mechanisms by which SAMHD1 impairs reactivation of HIV-1 gene expression.Overall impact. These studies will reveal novel physiological functions of SAMHD1 during HIV-1infection of primary target cells which are beyond its known function in restricting virus replication.Furthermore our interdisciplinary studies will yield new results to fundamentally enhance our mechanisticunderstanding of SAMHD1 in regulating HIV-1 infection viral gene expression and anti-HIV innateimmune responses.","AIDS/HIV problem;Address;Affect;Antiviral Agents;Autoimmune Diseases;Binding;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cells;Development;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;HIV;HIV-1;Human;Hydrolase;I Kappa B-Alpha;Immune signaling;Immunity;Impairment;In Vitro;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Innate Immune Response;Interdisciplinary Study;Interferon Type I;Interferons;Italy;Long Terminal Repeats;Maps;Mediating;Molecular;Mutation;Myeloid Cells;NF-kappa B;Natural Immunity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Primary Infection;Proteins;Regulation;Reporting;Rest;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Site;Stimulus;Terminal Repeat Sequences;Testing;Text;Viral;Viral Genes;Viral reservoir;Virus Diseases;Virus Latency;Virus Replication;antiretroviral therapy;antiviral immunity;cell type;design;experience;global health;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;interferon regulatory factor-7;knock-down;macrophage;monocyte;novel;promoter","SAMHD1-mediated regulation of HIV-1 innate immunity and viral gene expression","Project NarrativePersistent HIV-1 infection remains a global health challenge despite effective antiretroviral therapy.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biomedical Imaging; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Rehabilitation","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTSpeech sounds are the most important sounds that humans hear yet our knowledge of how the complexcortical network of auditory and auditory-related brain regions subserves speech perception is limited. Ouroverarching goal is to understand where and how speech information is represented within this network. Thefocus of this proposal is to test directly predictive coding models of speech perception. In predictive codinghypotheses the brain minimizes the differences between internally generated expectations and sensoryobservations through an ongoing interaction between sensory and higher-order cortical regions. We use novel combinations of complementary invasive and non-invasive experimental methods to studythese brain regions in neurosurgery patients who require placement of chronic intracranial electrodes. Theseexperiments involve combining direct cortical electrophysiological recording methods with non-invasiveelectroencephalography electrical stimulation techniques and anatomical and functional neuroimagingmethods. We also obtain causal evidence of network functional properties by studying the effects of selectivelydisrupting the function of specific components of this network. Our investigative strategy makes use of theseunique experimental opportunities to overcome long-standing barriers to progress in this research field. We will pursue our goals by testing hypotheses regarding: (1) the locations functional properties andconnectivity patterns of auditory cortical fields and auditory-related cortices of the temporal and frontal lobesthat are engaged in speech processing (2) predictive coding models of speech signaling within this networkand (3) the behavioral consequences and neural signatures of selective disruption of the network. These objectives are pursued by an experienced multidisciplinary group of investigators with expertiseencompassing all required clinical and research topic areas. To our knowledge the resulting data will be thefirst of its kind to directly demonstrate how speech information is processed at all levels of auditory corticalhierarchy and provide causal evidence of the role of feedback projections on speech information processingwithin canonical auditory cortex. Detailed characterization of this network will improve our understanding of thepathophysiology of disease states affecting this system and will provide mechanistic insights that are requiredto inform the design of new treatment strategies.","Acoustics;Address;Affect;Anatomy;Anterior;Area;Attention;Auditory;Auditory area;Behavioral;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain imaging;Brain region;Chronic;Clinical Research;Code;Communication impairment;Complement;Complex;Comprehension;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Excision;Feedback;Functional Imaging;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Hearing;Hearing problem;Human;Individual;Inferior frontal gyrus;Knowledge;Learning;Lesion;Location;Marshal;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Names;Neurons;Operative Surgical Procedures;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Physiology;Play;Process;Projections and Predictions;Property;Rehabilitation therapy;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Scalp structure;Secondary to;Seizures;Semantics;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Site;Speech;Speech Perception;Speech Sound;Stimulus;System;Techniques;Temporal Lobe;Testing;anatomic imaging;base;design;expectation;experience;experimental study;frontal lobe;hearing impairment;imaging modality;improved;information processing;insight;knowledge of results;language processing;multidisciplinary;neuroimaging;neurosurgery;novel;novel strategies;programs;relating to nervous system;sound;speech processing;treatment strategy","Human Auditory Cortex Physiology","PROJECT NARRATIVEThis research program will elucidate the organization of human brain networks engaged in speech perceptionusing a unique combination of non-invasive and invasive experimental methods.

Insulin resistance (IR) a reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin is typicallyinduced by obesity. In late middle-age IR is associated with deficits in memory and executive functionperformance and increased AD risk. The applicant Dr. Auriel Willette recently found using MagneticResonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data that IR in late middle-aged adults isassociated with atrophy lower glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in prefrontal cortex (PFC) a brain areaimpacted by early AD that subserves executive function. He also previously found that long-term calorierestriction (CR) in aged rhesus macaques lowers IR reduces PFC atrophy associated with IR and improvescognitive performance. The goal of this project is to determine if a previously validated intermittent CR diet thatreduces IR in late middle-aged adults composed of five ad libitum days and two consecutive days ofconsuming 530 kilocalories (5-2 CR) improves executive function performance and changes PFC functionalMRI (fMRI) activation during executive tasks.

Dr. Willette's primary mentor at theNational Institute on Aging Dr. Mark Mattson is a leader in CR neuroscience and conducting CR clinicaltrials. Dr. Willette will work with a cross-disciplinary team of intramural and extramural co-mentors to gain therequired training for performing this study. Specifically Dr. Willette will add to his two years of clinicalexperience by being trained in conducting clinical trials through Dr. Josephine Egan the NIA Clinical Directorand Chief of the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation Dr. Mattson and Dr. Dimitrios Kapogiannis a tenure-trackNeurologist who has conducted several clinical trials. Dr. Willette will develop expertise in task-based fMRI andcognitive testing from Dr. Kapogiannis Dr. Arthur Kramer a leader in the field of cognition and aging with over30 years of neuroimaging experience and Dr. Richard O'Brien Chair of Neurology at Johns HopkinsUniversity. For AD neuropathology Drs. Mattson and O'Brien are established experts in animal models andolder adults respectively. For insulin signaling Dr. Egan is a senior investigator and pioneer in the field ofinsulin regulation incretins and glucose metabolism. In Aims 1 and 2 (K99 mentored phase) 40 cognitivelynormal late middle-aged women with IR on a given visit will engage in a battery of executive function tasksoutside of the MRI scanner perform a fMRI color-word Stroop task that induces PFC brain activity andperform a fMRI energy-dense food preference task that also activates PFC through cognitive appraisal of food.This testing will occur at baseline and after 8 weeks of either 5-2 CR (n=20) or an ad libitum control diet (n=20).Compliance visits will be conducted every 2 weeks. This project will be conducted through the Laboratory ofClinical Investigation at Harbor Hospital the NIA's clinical research unit. The NIA Scientific Review Committeehas approved this project and through the Intramural Research Program has adequate resources anddedicated personnel time to be completed in a timely manner. Additional training will include coursework inclinical trials neurobiology of aging ethics management seminars and workshops for prospectiveindependent investigators including grant writing and tenure-track topics. In Aim 3 (R00 independent phase)Dr. Willette will combine his previous and new training to conduct a similar 5-2 CR intervention in aged patientswith Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and IR. In addition to cognition and fMRI he will acquire and processfluorodeoxyglucose data (FDG-PET) to examine resting glucose uptake in PFC. He will gain FDG-PET trainingduring the K99 phase from Dr. Bradley Christian senior PET researcher and co-director of PET Physics at theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison. Given that IR is higher in MCI compared to cognitively normal adultsassociations with cognition and brain measures may be stronger than in the late middle-aged cohort. The 5-2CR intervention is expected to improve executive function stabilize fMRI PFC activity and increase PFCglucose uptake. These outcomes would have a substantial impact on possible interventions for early AD.","Adult;Affect;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Alzheimers disease biomarker;American;Amyloid deposition;Animal Model;Area;Atrophic;Biological Markers;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Caloric Restriction;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cognition;Cognitive;Color;Conduct Clinical Trials;Consumption;Counseling;Data;Early Intervention;Eating;Educational workshop;Elderly;Endocrinology;Ethics;Executive Dysfunction;Extramural Activities;Food;Food Preferences;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Grant;Hospitals;Human;Human Resources;Impaired cognition;Individual;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Intervention;Intramural Research Program;Laboratories;Macaca mulatta;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Memory;Mentors;Methods;National Institute on Aging;Neurobiology;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurologist;Neurology;Neurosciences;Obesity;Outcome;Overweight;Participant;Pathogenesis;Patients;Performance;Peripheral;Phase;Physics;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevalence;Process;Reducing diet;Research;Research Personnel;Research Training;Resources;Rest;Review Committee;Risk;Supervision;Testing;Time;Training;Universities;Visit;Weight;Wisconsin;Woman;Work;Writing;aged;base;cerebral atrophy;clinical investigation;cognitive performance;cognitive testing;cohort;cost;dietary;dietary control;executive function;experience;fluorodeoxyglucose;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;glucose metabolism;glucose uptake;high risk;improved;insulin regulation;insulin signaling;middle age;mild cognitive impairment;neuroimaging;neuropathology;nonhuman primate;pre-clinical;prospective;tenure track;uptake","Insulin Resistance Biomarkers of Brain Function and Intermittent Calorie Restriction","The increasing prevalence of obesity will lead to more adults with IR which could increase AD risk.

"No NIH Category available","Peripheral neuropathy (PN) affects about 50% of the diabetic population. The symptoms range from painnumbness paresthesia and ulceration in the extremities and PN is the major cause of non-traumaticamputations. In 2010 the VA healthcare system spent $206 million on care of veterans that received lower-limb amputations due to diabetes-induced PN. This single statistic illustrates the impact of this disease and thedevastating effect it has on the quality of life and functioning of veterans and their families as well as the largecost burden on the VA healthcare system. We now know that PN can develop before the onset ofhyperglycemia and can be detected in subjects with pre-diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance. Thesesubjects are often overweight with symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Recent statistics indicate that 72% of allVeterans are overweight or obese placing them at high risk of developing PN and type 2 diabetes. Thediagnosis of PN in its early stages is challenging and no treatment is available besides glycemic control whichis ineffective for type 2 diabetes. With the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes at epidemic levels in boththe veteran and general populations there is a critical need for improving the diagnosis of PN and finding atreatment. The goals of this proposal are to investigate both of these important issues. A key to improving treatment of PN like many disorders is early detection. Presently the clinical diagnosisfor PN is subjective with most veterans receiving a diagnosis of PN only after presenting with symptoms andadvanced PN. Earlier diagnosis of PN is needed if new treatments aimed at preserving nerves and stimulatingregeneration is to be successful. Recently loss of sub-epithelial corneal nerves has been promoted as being asurrogate marker of PN. However utilizing corneal confocal microscopy to evaluate loss of corneal nerves asa routine method to detect PN would be challenging. Thus we have developed an objective test relying oncorneal sensitivity as a simple screening method for detecting PN. The method employs the use of ahyperosmolar eye drop to activate transient receptor channel-8 receptors in the cornea to cause reflex blinkingand squinting if the nerves are intact. Even before the onset of hyperglycemia i.e. pre-diabetes damagedperipheral nerves lose sensation and will have less reflex response to corneal stimulation. Development of amethod of early detection of PN that can be performed annually during a routine clinical primary care visit oreye examination would improve the standard of care for veterans with diabetes. In this application we will also extend our examination of a safe and cost effective treatment to slowprogression and reverse nerve damage caused by PN thereby providing veterans a solution for thisdevastating problem. We first introduced fish oil as a treatment of PN in VA supported pre-clinical studies inthe last funding period and will continue these studies culminating in a feasibility study for treating humansubjects with type 2 diabetes and neuropathy. Our previous studies suggest that long-chain omega-3 (n-3)polyunsaturated fatty acids that are commonly found in fish oils primarily eicosapentaenoic acid anddocosahexaenoic acid may be an effective treatment for PN associated with pre-diabetes and diabetes.Consumption of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish oils is low in the Western diet due to historicallyincreased consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Numerous clinical studies suggest potential benefitsof n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption on various diseases. Therefore there is a tremendous interestin increasing the dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids as a capsule for the general public and forselect clinical populations that may benefit the most. Even though the health benefits of n-3 polyunsaturatedfatty acids have been widely examined their role as a potential treatment for diabetes complications includingPN have not been thoroughly studied. The studies presented in this application will fill this void and willprovide rationale to advance to clinical trials n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids i.e. fish oils as a treatment for PN.","Affect;Blinking;Caring;Climacteric;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Confocal Microscopy;Consumption;Cornea;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diagnosis;Diet;Dietary intake;Disease;Docosahexaenoic Acids;Early Diagnosis;Eicosapentaenoic Acid;Epidemic;Epithelial;Esthesia;Eyedrops;Family;Feasibility Studies;Fish Oils;Funding;General Population;Goals;Health Benefit;Health Care Costs;Healthcare Systems;Hyperglycemia;Impairment;Limb structure;Lower Extremity;Metabolic syndrome;Methods;Morphology;N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid;Natural regeneration;Nerve;Neuropathy;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Numbness;Obesity;Omega-3 Fatty Acids;Ophthalmic examination and evaluation;Oral;Outcome Measure;Overweight;Pain;Pain management;Paresthesia;Patients;Peripheral Nerves;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Physicians;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids;Population;Prediabetes syndrome;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Quality of life;Rattus;Reflex action;Research;Role;Screening procedure;Strabismus;Structure;Surrogate Markers;Symptoms;Testing;Time;Topical application;Type 2 diabetic;Ulcer;Veterans;Visit;behavior test;behavioral response;blink reflexes;capsule;clinical Diagnosis;corneal epithelium;corneal regeneration;cost;cost effective treatment;density;diabetic;diabetic rat;diet-induced obesity;effective therapy;efficacy evaluation;fall injury;fall risk;glucose tolerance;glycemic control;high risk;human subject;impaired glucose tolerance;improved;improved outcome;injury and repair;interest;limb amputation;loss of function;military veteran;nerve damage;novel;peripheral nerve damage;preclinical study;preservation;receptor;repaired;response;screening;standard of care;statistics;western diet","Diabetic Neuropathy:  Function-Structure of Corneal Nerves to Assess Injury-Repair","Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is a major complication of diabetes affecting about 50% of the veteran population.The symptoms range from pain numbness paresthesia and ulceration in the extremities it is also the majorcause of non-traumatic amputations.

"No NIH Category available","In 2015 9.4% of the United States population had diabetes and statistically about 50% of these patients will oralready have developed diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). This problem is even more critical in theveteran health care population with nearly 25% of veterans having diabetes primarily type 2. In veteransdiabetes is the leading cause of blindness end-stage renal disease and non-trauma related amputations. Theonly treatment for DPN is glycemic control which is ineffective in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Thus there is acritical need of a treatment for DPN. Our studies have demonstrated that treating diabetic rodents with DPNwith omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from menhaden (fish) oil initiates nerve damagerepair and reverses DPN. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the predominateomega-3 PUFA found in fish oil and are the precursors of E and D series resolvins respectively which haveanti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. We have shown that these metabolites alone elicit repair ofnerve damage caused by diabetes when administered endogenously in vivo. As we initiate plans to advanceomega-3 PUFA to a clinical trial for DPN there remains several questions to be addressed. One commonproblem with the design of many of the previous clinical trials of omega-3 PUFA primarily for treatment ofcardiovascular disease were that they failed to determine the circulating levels of omega-3 PUFA or theirmetabolites over the course of the study. For most of these studies it was unknown whether dosing wassufficient to make a therapeutic change in the omega-3 index defined as the sum of EPA and DHA as apercentage of total fatty acids in red blood cells. Another poorly explored question has been what is the bestsource or composition of omega-3 PUFAs that will provide the most favorable and safe outcome? This ishighlighted by the recent REDUCE-IT study that found that a 4 g daily dose of icosapent ethyl (ethyl ester ofEPA) to have a statistical benefit on reducing ischemic events in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia. Was thesignificant outcome achieved in this study due to icosapent ethyl being a more effective source of omega-3PUFA or use of a higher dose than many previous studies? We have shown that treating type 2 diabetic ratswith fish oil that achieved an omega-3 PUFA concentration in serum that was obtained in human subjectstreated with 4 g of fish oil per day is an efficacious treatment for DPN. However is fish oil the best source ofomega-3 PUFA for the treatment of DPN or are the ethyl ester derivatives of EPA and/or DHA moreefficacious? Ethyl esters of EPA (Vascepa) or the combination of EPA and DHA (Lovaza) arepharmaceutical compounds and represent a highly purified and concentrated source of EPA and DHA and voidof the less favorable compounds found in fish oil. Studies have shown that EPA and DHA and their metaboliteshave different molecular targets. Since the etiology of DPN is complex having both vascular and neuralpathological pathways it is likely that a combination of EPA and DHA as found in Lovaza will be needed foran effective treatment of DPN. Besides these pharmaceutical compounds are there other healthy alternativesto fish oil for the treatment of DPN? Commercially available algae's that primarily produce EPA or DHA may beanother environmental friendly and safe source of omega-3 PUFA. The studies presented in this applicationwill rigorously address the use of these alternative sources of omega-3 PUFA as a treatment for DPN anddetermine if omega-3 PUFA derived from pharmaceutical compounds i.e. ethyl ester derivatives of EPA orEPA/DHA or from industrial sources such as algae's that solely produce EPA or DHA free of cholesterol maybe a better choice than fish oil. The proposed studies will be conducted in rat models of pre-diabetes and type2 diabetes and will investigate translational endpoints including assessment of motor coordination and balanceand function and density of sensory neurons to track the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA on peripheral neuropathyand the results correlated with the omega-3 index and circulating levels of omega-3 PUFA metabolites.","Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Afferent Neurons;Algae;Amputation;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Behavioral;Blindness;Blood Circulation;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Caring;Cholesterol;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical Trials;Complex;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Consumption;Cornea;Diabetes Mellitus;Dietary intake;Disease;Docosahexaenoic Acids;Dose;Eicosapentaenoic Acid;End stage renal failure;Equilibrium;Erythrocytes;Esters;Etiology;Event;Fatty Acids;Fish Oils;Fishes;Functional disorder;Goals;Greenland;Health Care Costs;Healthcare;Heart;Heavy Metals;High Density Lipoproteins;Hypertriglyceridemia;Industrialization;Inflammatory;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Inuits;Limb structure;Measures;Modeling;Molecular Target;Motor;Nerve;Nerve Regeneration;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Numbness;Obesity;Oils;Omega-3 Fatty Acids;Outcome;Overweight;Pain;Paresthesia;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmacologic Substance;Physicians;Population;Prediabetes syndrome;Production;Property;Quality of life;Rattus;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent;Series;Serum;Skin;Source;Stress;Sum;Symptoms;Therapeutic;Type 2 diabetic;Ulcer;United States;Veterans;blood glucose regulation;cardioprotection;density;design;diabetic;diabetic rat;effective therapy;efficacious treatment;falls;glycemic control;human subject;improved;in vivo;indexing;menhaden;military veteran;mortality risk;nerve damage;nerve repair;patient population;preclinical study;relating to nervous system;repaired","Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in the Treatment of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy:  Is the source important?","Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a major complication of diabetes affecting about 50% of the veteranpopulation.

"No NIH Category available","Continuing advances in detection and treatment have greatly increased the number of cancer survivors aswell as more Veterans living with cancer because of continued therapy. However while these therapiesprolong life they are accompanied by adverse effects that introduce functional limitations and significantlyreduce quality of life of Veterans. For example taxane and platinum-based chemotherapies produce verypainful and debilitating peripheral neuropathies that greatly diminish patients quality of life. These agents canalso cause dry eye syndrome (DES) and in the case of platinum-based therapies hearing loss and tinnitusdue to ototoxicity in 40-80% of adults. Currently no effective treatment exists to reduce the incidence of thesedebilitating side effects of therapy and they remain a significant unmet need in healthcare. In recent yearsevidence has accrued that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) an essential redox coenzyme plays animportant role in protection against axonal injury. This laboratory recently demonstrated that a naturallyoccurring vitamin B3 precursor of NAD+ nicotinamide riboside (NR; NIAGEN) can both prevent and reversepaclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in rodents. The main goal of this application is to obtain preclinicaldata to evaluate the ability NR to improve the quality of life and function of Veterans with cancer as well ascancer survivors who suffer the sequelae of chemotherapy. The proposed studies will focus on a platinumcompound cisplatin that is associated with a high incidence of painful peripheral neuropathy as well as oculartoxicity and ototoxicity. The first aim of this proposal will determine whether prophylactic treatment with NRprevents cisplatin-induced allodynia (hypersensitivity) to tactile and cool stimuli as well as blunts theaversive/affective dimension of the neuropathy. Hypersensitivity to tactile and cool stimuli will be assessed invehicle- and NR-treated rats by determining threshold to withdrawal from application of calibrated von Freyfilaments or a cool stimulus to the hind paw. The place escape avoidance paradigm will be used to assesschanges in the aversive/affective components of nociception. The second aim of the proposal will determinewhether prophylactic treatment with NR can prevent photophobia (light aversion) as well as cornealhypersensitivity and deficits in tear production induced by cisplatin. Photophobia will be assessed in vehicle-and NR-treated rats by measuring time spent in a brightly-lit chamber while corneal hypersensitivity will beassessed by changes in withdrawal responses to tactile stimulation of the cornea or degree of squintinginduced by application of hyperosmolar saline drops. Reflex and basal tear production will be assessed bySchirmer's test. The final aim of this proposal will determine whether prophylactic treatment with NR canprevent cisplatin-induced loss of hearing. Cochlear function will be assessed in vehicle- and NR-treated rats bydistortion product otoacoustic emissions and functionality of central nervous system auditory pathways will beassessed by auditory brainstem responses. These experiments will be conducted in both male and female ratsto assess possible sex-dependent differences. The three aims will be conducted in parallel because they arenot dependent on one another. Moreover a positive outcome in any one would support a clinical trial of atreatment that could be prevent chemotherapy-induced disabilities in Veterans and substantially improve theirquality of life.

"No NIH Category available","There is a significant unmet need for new approaches to treat migraine and post-traumatic headache (PTH) inVeterans who have suffered traumatic brain injury (TBI). The major aim of this proposal is to modulatecerebello-thalamic circuits to treat migraine and PTH. Headache reduces quality of life and can coincide withdisabling sensory abnormalities including photophobia and pain. Migraine alone is estimated to affect 18% ofwomen and 6% of men (12% overall). However this prevalence is even greater in Veterans (50% overall) whohave served in Iraq and Afghanistan and have experienced TBI and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. To datenearly half of patients who have either migraine or PTH receive no beneficial outcomes with currenttreatments.This proposal will test the hypothesis that inhibition of cerebello-thalamic circuits can be used to treat migraine-like behaviors in mice. In the first aim the plan is to inhibit the posterior thalamic area and the fastigial nucleusof the cerebellum to treat mice that are in a headache-like state. To model headache we will use calcitoningene-related peptide (CGRP) (a neuropeptide that is necessary and sufficient to induce migraine) and a TBImodel involving mild closed head impact. We will test mice in three translatable behavior paradigms thatmeasure light aversion touch hypersensitivity and grimace. We will modulate the posterior thalamic area andfastigial nuclei of the cerebellum using a chemogenetic strategy with an inhibitory ligand-activated designerreceptor. Our preliminary data indicate that stimulation of those two brain regions is sufficient to inducemigraine-like behaviors in mice. Successful completion of this aim will provide translatable targets for directbrain modulation to treat headache disorders. In the second aim of this proposal we will use blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) to identify downstream targets of theposterior thalamic area and cerebellum during a migraine-like or post-traumatic headache-like state. We willperform imaging in mice after they are given CGRP pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) (a peptide that is also reported to cause migraine in patients) or mild TBI. We will alsooptogenetically stimulate the posterior thalamic area and cerebellum fastigial nucleus to map functionalconnectivity changes of downstream targets in the brain. The goal is to identify additional brain targets that aremore accessible for modulation.The significance of this study is the potential translation of these pre-clinical studies to the clinic. With largepopulations of Veterans suffering from headache disorders the need for new therapeutics is critical. This studyhas the potential to provide a road map for new therapeutic approachs to treating migraine and PTH.","Affect;Afghanistan;Anatomy;Area;Behavior;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain region;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Cerebellum;Chronic Daily Headaches;Clinic;Clinical;Data;Development;Functional Imaging;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Goals;Headache;Headache Disorders;Human;Hypersensitivity;Image;Incidence;Injections;Investigation;Iraq;Knowledge;Life;Ligands;Light;Maps;Measures;Medical;Migraine;Modeling;Mus;Neurologic;Neuropeptides;Nucleus fastigii;Outcome;Outcome Study;Pain;Patients;Peptides;Phenotype;Photophobia;Post-Traumatic Headaches;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevalence;Quality of life;Reporting;Research;Role;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Site;Structure;Suicide;Symptoms;Tactile;Testing;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;Time;Touch sensation;Translations;Traumatic Brain Injury;Veterans;Woman;base;blood oxygen level dependent;chronic painful condition;combat zone;cutaneous allodynia;expectation;experience;head impact;improved;men;mild traumatic brain injury;military veteran;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;optogenetics;pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide;preclinical study;receptor;response;service member","Investigation of cerebello-thalamic circuits for the treatment of headache","Migraine and post-traumatic headache are common chronic pain conditions that affect a disproportionatelylarge number of Veterans.

"No NIH Category available","Obesity and diabetes are major public health issues that affect quality of life and also have high social andeconomic costs. According to the CDC approximately 10% of U.S. adults have diabetes now and 33% areexpected to have diabetes by 2050. At the same time obesity has reached epidemic proportions with over60% of the U.S. population being overweight or obese. Therefore there is a serious demand for thedevelopment of new therapeutics to combat obesity and diabetes. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is anendocrine hormone that ameliorates metabolic dysfunction in a number of obese animal models and humans.Extended administration of FGF21 causes weight loss in rodents and administration of FGF21 analogs toobese humans increases weight loss and improves metabolic profiles. Recently we discovered that FGF21functions physiologically and pharmacologically to suppress carbohydrate intake and sweet taste preference.Importantly we and others have found that many of the beneficial effects of FGF21 are mediated through itsactions on the central nervous system. However the mechanism of FGF21 action in the brain and the neuronaltarget(s) for these effects has not been determined. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the neuralcircuit(s) regulating FGF21-mediated suppression of carbohydrate intake. The aims of this grant are to 1)determine the direct neuronal target responsible for FGF21-mediated suppression of carbohydrate intake invivo 2) determine the role of oxytocin signaling in FGF21s suppressive effect on simple sugar intake and 3)determine the effect of FGF21 on the modulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system and feeding behavior. Toaccomplish these aims we have generated novel animal models and tools to examine these experimentalaims. These studies will provide new fundamental insights into the regulation of whole-body glucosehomeostasis and food-related reward by peripheral endocrine signals acting on the central nervous system. Inaddition these studies may identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetes and obesity.","Address;Adult;Affect;Animal Model;Behavior;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Carbohydrates;Caring;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Complex;Consumption;Data;Desire for food;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Dopamine;Endocrine;Energy Intake;Epidemic;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Feedback;Feeding behaviors;Food;Food Energy;Genes;Glutamates;Goals;Grant;Health Care Costs;Healthcare;Hepatic;Homeostasis;Hormonal;Hormones;Human;Hypothalamic structure;Intake;Lipids;Liver;Macronutrients Nutrition;Mediating;Medical;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic dysfunction;Metabolic syndrome;Modeling;Motivation;Neuraxis;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Nutrient;Obesity;Organism;Overweight;Oxytocin;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Pharmacology;Physiological;Population;Production;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Quality of life;Regulation;Research;Rewards;Rodent;Role;Satiation;Signal Transduction;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Source;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Taste Perception;Taste preferences;Time;Ventral Tegmental Area;Veterans;Waist-Hip Ratio;Weight Gain;analog;blood glucose regulation;burden of illness;combat;compliance behavior;cost;economic cost;fibroblast growth factor 21;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;liver function;mesolimbic system;metabolic profile;molecular targeted therapies;neural circuit;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;obesity treatment;paraventricular nucleus;preference;receptor expression;social;sugar;sweet taste perception;tool","Central Mechanisms Regulating Macronutrient Intake","Approximately 78% of Veterans are overweight or obese which costs millions of dollars in medical and non-medical costs.

However the mechanisms underlying therelationship between obesity and hypertension remain largely unknown. The goal of this proposal is to identifythe neuronal and molecular processes that control sympathetic activity and blood pressure and howdysregulation in these processes contribute to obesity-associated cardiovascular risks. This proposal is basedon the hypothesis that mTORC1 signaling in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neurons are critical forsympathetic and blood pressure regulation with important pathophysiological implications in obesity. We willuse a multidisciplinary strategy combining unique genetically engineered mouse models that permit selectivemodulation of key pathways in defined neurons with novel and cutting edge neuro-technologies to preciselyand remotely modulate the firing of distinct arcuate nucleus neuronal populations in freely moving animals withsophisticated integrative physiology for sympathetic and cardiovascular phenotyping. We will investigate thecontribution of mTORC1 signaling in arcuate nucleus neurons that express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) oragouti-related protein (AgRP) to the regulation of sympathetic activity and arterial pressure and obesity-associated hypertension and sympathetic nerve activation. We will also use chemogenetic and optogenetics toprobe the functional relevance of arcuate nucleus POMC and AgRP neurons for the regulation of arterialpressure and sympathetic activity in normal and obese states. This work should unravel novel mechanismsthat underlie obesity-associated sympathetic activation and hypertension making our work of high clinicalrelevance.

"No NIH Category available","Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a lethal and devastating complication of hematopoietic celltransplantation (HCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) where HCT/BMT constitutes a predominant andcurative approach for the treatment of hematological malignancies and other disorders. Because of exposureto environmental agents such as the carcinogen agent orange members of the US Military are under risk todevelop hematological malignancies during their years as active soldiers or later as veterans. GVHD is causedby donor (graft) T cell-mediated immune attack of recipient (host) tissues and also complicates the clinicalpicture after combined transplantation of bone marrow and a solid organ. Veterans are also under higher riskto develop end-stage solid organ failure that requires transplantation. Novel treatment strategies are needed inBMT/HCT patients to maintain the donor T lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor immune (graft-versus-tumor (GVT)response and suppress the GVHD. In this context therapeutic achievement of mixed chimerism which ischaracterized by the presence of donor and recipient hematopoietic cell after transplantation results inimmune tolerance by donor T cells against the recipient and in regulation of GVHD. Mixed chimerism alsotolerizes recipients immune cells against the donor suppressing the rejection of solid organ graft aftercombined transplantation and reduces the use of toxic immune suppressive medications. Current clinicalprotocols mostly use nonmyeloablative preparation (lower dose of chemotherapy and/or radiation withoutcompletely eradicating recipients bone marrow cells) before the BMT/HCT to achieve mixed chimerism. Thisapproach carries a high risk of tumor relapse. By contrast we use myeloablative preparation (higher dose ofchemotherapy and/or radiation with complete eradication of recipients bone marrow cells) in our BMT modelwith mixed chimerism where the GVT response is preserved and the risk of cancer relapse is reduced. Weinduce mixed chimerism-dependent regulation of GVHD by modulation of intestinal immune pathways using acompletely novel approach and with self-limited helminth colonization of the gut. We have shown before thathelminths promote the generation of mixed chimerism by stimulating recipient cell Th2 signaling and Th2-dependent generation of TGF. In this application in Aim #1 we propose to investigate the elements ofTh2/TGF pathways critical to generation of mixed chimerism. In Aim #2 we will explore the role of differentimmune regulatory circuitries relevant to mixed chimerism-dependent regulation of GVHD and solid organrejection. In Aim #3 we will investigate the effect of mixed chimerism-induced immune regulation on the GVTresponse using a mouse leukemia/lymphoma model syngeneic with the BMT recipient strain. Our long-termgoals are to dissect immune regulatory pathways important in helminth-induced mixed chimerism and applythe knowledge to clinical transplantation. Live helminths have been safely administered to immune suppressedpatients and helminth products with immune regulatory properties have been discovered for potential use inclinical practice. Therefore targeting helminth-modulated signaling pathways with small molecules helminthsor their products may be a safe potent and novel approach to promote transplantation tolerance without usingtoxic immune suppressive medications and preserve the beneficial GVT effect.","Achievement;Antigen Presentation;Antigens;B-Cell Neoplasm;Blood Cells;Blood donor;Bone Marrow Cells;Bone Marrow Purging;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Cancer Relapse;Carcinogens;Cell Survival;Cells;Chemotherapy and/or radiation;Chimerism;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Complication;Critical Pathways;Development;Disease;Donor person;Dose;Elements;Exposure to;Generations;Genetic;Goals;Graft Rejection;Graft-Versus-Tumor Induction;Helminths;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;High Dose Chemotherapy;Hygiene;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immune Tolerance;Immune system;Immunomodulators;Intestines;Kidney Failure;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;Lymphocyte;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Military Personnel;Modeling;Mus;Organ;Organ Transplantation;Organ failure;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptides;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Preparation;Procedures;Property;Protocols documentation;Regimen;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;Research;Risk;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Soldier;Solid;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Thymectomy;Thymus Gland;Tissues;Transforming Growth Factor beta;Transplant Recipients;Transplantation;Transplantation Tolerance;Treatment Protocols;Veterans;agent orange;base;cancer recurrence;cancer risk;chemotherapy;clinical practice;conditional knockout;conditioning;end-stage organ failure;environmental agent;graft vs host disease;gut colonization;hematopoietic cell transplantation;high risk;immunoregulation;irradiation;leukemia/lymphoma;member;microorganism;military service;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;preservation;prevent;recurrent infection;response;small molecule;tool;transplant model;treatment strategy;tumor","Mixed Chimerism-Dependent Tolerance After Myeloablative Bone Marrow Transplantation","The U.S. Veterans are under risk to develop lethal blood cancers due to exposure to carcinogens such asagent orange during their active military service.

"No NIH Category available","Approximately 200000 veterans receive cancer treatment at Veterans Health Administration facilities. Withimproving survival rates for many cancers the deleterious long-term cardiovascular side effects of cancertherapies have become increasingly apparent. For many of the cancers that frequently occur among veteransradiation therapy (RT) is an integral component of treatment. Despite improvements in the techniques used totarget RT to the cancer tissue some radiation always reaches surrounding normal tissue. Endothelial damagewithin the small blood vessels or radiation endotheliopathy has been postulated as a major cause of RT-induced injury of normal tissue. Many post-radiation syndromes have been attributed to radiationendotheliopathy. One of them is cognitive decline which is estimated to affect as many as 90% of patientsafter brain RT. Mechanistically radiation endotheliopathy is believed to be initiated by mitochondrial injuryleading to chronic oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction over a period of years. Thus intervention at thetime of RT is likely critical for reducing radiation endotheliopathy and its sequelae including cognitive decline.The discovery of effective mitigators will require a unified view of the pathways by which RT-relatedmitochondrial injury influences various steps in this progression; this has not been achieved to date. The objective of the proposed project is to identify the mechanisms by which mitochondrial injury promotesradiation endotheliopathy and to test whether protection from mitochondrial injury prevents adverse short- andlong-term effects of RT in small blood vessels. RT induces mitochondrial DNA damage perturbs ATPproduction enhances the mitochondrial membrane potential Ca2+ uptake and reactive oxygen species (ROS)production. The mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) regulates Ca2+ uptake into the mitochondrial matrix andwas recently reported as being redox-dependent. Mitochondrial Ca2+ augments ROS production that promotesfurther mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus we posit that MCU in endothelial cells (ECs) drives a feed-forwardcircuit with mitochondrial ROS that leads to long-term adverse effects of RT including cognitive decline afterbrain RT. Indeed published data from our laboratory demonstrate that blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake issufficient to reduce mitochondrial ROS production and protect EC barrier function. Thus our centralhypothesis is that MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria is required for excessive ROSproduction after RT and thus for chronic mitochondrial DNA damage blood brain barrier (BBB)breakdown capillary loss and cognitive decline. This hypothesis is further supported by our strong pilotdata that inhibition of MCU in ECs during RT abolishes mitochondrial DNA damage in vitro and protectsagainst BBB breakdown in vivo. Our novel tools and assays put us in the perfect position to perform theproposed study. These include genetic models in which mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can be modeled selectivelyin ECs state-of-the-art radiation equipment assays of microvessel dysfunction and behavior in vivo andinnovative nanoparticle-based tools for selectively targeting ECs at the time of RT. Our aims are to 1. dissectthe mechanisms by which mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake drives endothelial injury by RT 2. test whetherinhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in ECs protects against RT-induced injury in vivo and 3.determine the extent to which nanoparticle-mediated delivery of MCU inhibitors protects against RT-induced EC injury. The rationale of our proposed studies is that an improved understanding of the mechanisms of radiationendotheliopathy will enable the development of effective therapies. Upon its successful completion we willhave established mechanisms by which MCU promotes mitochondrial injury after radiation and howendothelial-selective delivery of an MCU inhibitor might be implemented as a first step towards developingeffective mitigators of radiation endotheliopathy that will benefit our veterans.","Affect;Behavior;Binding;Biological Assay;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;Blood capillaries;Brain;Calmodulin;Cancer Burden;Cancer cell line;Cardiovascular system;Cell Aging;Chest;Chronic;Cranial Irradiation;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;Data;Development;Diastolic heart failure;Effectiveness;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Equipment;Fibroblasts;Functional disorder;Genetic Models;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Healthcare;Heart failure;Impaired cognition;In Vitro;Injury;Intervention;Ion Channel;Laboratories;Long-Term Effects;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Membrane Potentials;Microvascular Dysfunction;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial DNA;Mitochondrial Matrix;Modeling;Molecular;Normal tissue morphology;Outcome;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phosphotransferases;Positioning Attribute;Production;Publishing;Pulmonary Fibrosis;Radiation;Radiation Injuries;Radiation Syndromes;Radiation therapy;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reporting;Research;Respiratory Burst;Survival Rate;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tissues;Vascular Diseases;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;base;blood-brain barrier disruption;burden of illness;cancer care;cancer survival;cancer therapy;cell injury;clinical practice;combat;effective therapy;endothelial dysfunction;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;mitochondrial dysfunction;mitochondrial membrane;nanoparticle;novel;prevent;programs;radiation adverse effect;radiation effect;radiation mitigator;radiation-induced injury;side effect;tool;uptake","Leveraging mitochondrial function to combat radiation therapy-induced microvascular disease","Approximately 200000 veterans receive cancer care in VHA facilities.

"No NIH Category available","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). Agreat deal of our understanding about the immunologic processes that underlie MS derives from studies in itsautoimmune animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However the vast majority ofstudies in EAE and MS have focused on evaluating and targeting CD4+ T cell responses with the generalassumption that these diseases are predominantly Th1/Th17-mediated and Th2/Treg-modulated. Recentreports from others and us indicate that CD8+ T cells play a role in the pathogenesis as well as regulation ofautoimmune demyelination. Our studies in MS and EAE have provided evidence for a novel andunexpected disease suppressive role for CNS-specific CD8+ T cells (CNS-CD8). Based on our data wehypothesize that specific functional and phenotypic subsets of CNS-CD8 form an important andexploitable arm of immune regulation during autoimmune demyelinating disease. We propose that thisprocess can be harnessed for the development of effective immunotherapeutic approaches. Theexperiments proposed in this application will utilize EAE models to address the fundamental cellular andmolecular mechanisms of immune modulation (IFN and its receptor trafficking and cytotoxicity suppressionat the site of pathology) by these autoregulatory CD8 T cells and to define a potent and enhanceable immunesuppressive subset of CNS-CD8. Further a novel vaccination strategy that reliably engages disease-reversingCNS-CD8 will also be investigated as a proof of principle.

In the proposedstudies we will dissect the mechanisms of such CNS-CD8-mediated disease suppression and investigatenovel approaches for activating and enhancing this population with the goal of developing innovative treatmentstrategies for this disease and providing important insights into an overlooked area of MS immunology.","VA","10248844","7/6/2021","BX-20-001","2I01BX003677-05","2","I01","BX","003677","05","","","7/1/2017","6/30/2025","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRD1 NURB-H (01)]"," ","6715309","KARANDIKAR, NITIN J","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","US","41.653383","-91.540485","481031","IOWA CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER","IOWA CITY","IA","Independent Hospitals","522462208","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," ","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","The primary goal of this application is to foster the development of Dr. Daniel Livorsi asan independent VHA investigator devoted to improving antimicrobial-prescribing across thecontinuum of healthcare. This application specifically focuses on optimizing the performance ofantimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in resource-limited settings. ASPs are hospital-based programs that ensure patients receive the right antimicrobial atthe right dose and for the right duration. These programs have proven benefits such asimproving patient safety and reducing antimicrobial resistance. ASPs are now mandated inevery VHA facility and will soon be required in non-VHA hospitals as well. The widespreadimplementation of robust ASPs is essential for addressing the crisis of antimicrobial resistance. Though necessary widespread ASP implementation will be challenging. Many ASPslack access to Infectious Disease (ID) specialistsincluding 23% of VHA-ASPsand it isunclear how ASPs can be effective in such resource-limited settings. This application will beginto address this problem through an ambitious but achievable Research Plan. Project 1 will analyze antimicrobial use data from across the VHA. Multivariable analysiswill be used to identify structural and process factors associated with optimal facility-level ASPperformance as measured by facility antimicrobial usage (primary outcome) and 7 secondarymetrics. The goal is to identify processes that work for ASPs even in the absence of IDpharmacists and ID physicians. Facilities will also be ranked on the risk-adjusted primaryoutcome; high and low performers will be identified. Project 2 will use qualitative researchmethods to determine provider attitudes and organizational factors that impede or fosterantimicrobial stewardship at 8 VHA hospitals with ASPs lacking ID support. For this project theteam will conduct research at 4 low-performing and 4 high-performing facilities as determinedby performance on the primary outcome. Project 3 will synthesize the findings from Projects 1and 2 to develop pilot improvement strategies for low-performing ASPs that lack ID support. Themodel of Physician Mentored Implementation will guide this intervention and a pretest-posttestdesign will be used to assess the effect of the intervention at the 2 intervention hospitalscompared to 2 control hospitals. In addition to the above Research Plan this application proposes integrated CareerDevelopment activities that build on Dr. Livorsis expertise in leading ASPs and his priorexperience with qualitative assessments and secondary data analysis. These careerdevelopment activities have the following objectives: 1) gaining fluency in the analysis ofnational VHA databases and the use of multilevel regression models; 2) building expertise inimplementation science with a focus on qualitative assessments; and 3) developing proficiencyin the conduct and analysis of multicenter interventions. These Research and Career Development plans will prepare Dr. Livorsi for submittingan Investigator-Initiated Research proposal focused on refining existing stewardship metrics.

"No NIH Category available","Aortic aneurysms are often silent and deadly and there is no medical therapy for them. Veteransespecially those who smoke (nicotine) are highly vulnerable to aortic aneurysms and their sequelae such asruptures and dissections. Thus understanding the fundamental basis for the disease is central to developingcures that can have a positive impact on health of veterans. Studies in human cohorts show that the non-coding microRNA-204 (miR-204) is downregulated in aorticaneurysmal tissue compared to non-affected tissue. In addition human population-based studies have shownincreased prevalence of aortic aneurysms and risk of their rupture with use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Theseantibiotics are widely (and often inappropriately) prescribed in the VA Health System. Antibiotics change thecomposition of the healthy gut microbiome (dysbiosis). This application will test the hypothesis that gut dysbiosiscaused by antibiotics promotes aortic aneurysms via its effect on aortic miR-204 expression. Dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells from a normal contractile phenotype to a dysfunctionalsynthetic one is a core feature in diseases of arterial remodeling including aortic aneurysms. Synthetic smoothmuscle cells preferentially utilize fat over glucose. This application will also explore the hypothesis thatdownregulation of miR-204 causes switching of aortic smooth muscle cells from a contractile to a dysfunctionalsynthetic phenotype by stimulating fatty acid utilization. The hypotheses underlying this application are grounded in exciting data showing that aortic miR-204expression is governed by the gut microbiome  dysbiosis caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics leads toprofound decrease in aortic miR-204 expression. In addition absence of miR-204 in mice makes themsusceptible to Angiotensin II-induced aortic aneurysmal dilatation and upregulates metabolites in the fatty acidoxidation pathway. This application will leverage state-of-the-art molecular tools and genetically modified mice to examinethe role of smooth muscle miR-204 in Angiotensin II-induced and nicotine-induced aortic aneurysms. It willdetermine if antibiotic-induced dysbiosis down-regulates aortic smooth muscle miR-204 and promotes aorticaneurysmal disease and whether this disease can be rescued by gain-of-function of miR-204. It will explore therole of miR-204 in regulating the plasticity of smooth muscle cells and investigate whether loss of function ofmiR-204 promotes dedifferentiation of aortic smooth muscle cells in aneurysmal disease. Additionally usingmetabolomics and bioenergetic tools it will uncover the role of miR-204 in regulating smooth muscle cellpreference for fuel utilization and investigate if deficiency of miR-204 in aortic aneurysmal disease increasessmooth muscle fatty acid oxidation. Aortic aneurysms are common and represent a significant health burden in veterans. This applicationoffers a unique opportunity to explore how a vascular microRNA regulated by gut bacteria is involved in thepathogenesis of aortic aneurysmal disease and could offer hope for new therapies for veterans who suffer fromthis disease.","Abdomen;Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm;Age-Years;Aneurysm;Angiotensin II;Antibiotics;Aorta;Aortic Aneurysm;Aortitis;Architecture;Bacteria;Bioenergetics;Blood;Blood Vessels;Caliber;Cellular Metabolic Process;Clinic;Cross-Sectional Studies;Data;Detection;Development;Dilatation - action;Disease;Dissection;Down-Regulation;Epigenetic Process;Fatty Acids;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Gap Junctions;Genes;Germ-Free;Glucose;Goals;Health;Health system;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Human;Incidence;Medial;Mediating;Medical;Metabolic;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Nicotine;Observational Study;Oral cavity;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plasma;Play;Population;Population Study;Prevalence;Primary Health Care;Recording of previous events;Risk;Role;Running;Rupture;Severities;Skin;Smoke;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Symptoms;Testing;Tissues;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Untranslated RNA;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Veterans;Work;acylcarnitine;aged;arterial remodeling;cohort;cooperative study;differential expression;dysbiosis;fatty acid elongases;fatty acid oxidation;fecal transplantation;gain of function;gut bacteria;gut dysbiosis;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;human disease;long chain fatty acid;loss of function;male;metabolomics;microbiome;microorganism;military veteran;mortality;novel therapeutics;oxidation;preference;prevent;tool;trait","Nexus between miR-204 gut microbiome and aortic aneurysmal disease","Aortic aneurysms are a potentially deadly expansion of the main blood vessel carryingblood from the heart.

"No NIH Category available","Background: The VA has pledged to reduce overuse of antibiotics and is a partner in the National ActionPlan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Overuse of antibiotics can lead to Clostridium difficile infectionsamong the individuals receiving antibiotics as well as antibiotic resistance that can complicate treatment offuture infections for all patients. Chronic antibiotic suppression (CAS) is defined as indefinite use of oralantibiotics following initial guideline recommended intravenous and oral antibiotics. There is evidence that CASmay be inappropriately used and overused. Thus there is a critical need to examine how CAS is prescribedand who benefits the most and who is harmed from CAS therapy. This knowledge can be used to develop anintervention to de-implement and optimize CAS use. In this study we will examine CAS treatment forprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). PJIs occur after hip knee or shoulder replacement surgery and are associatedwith a high clinical and economic impact. In the VHA system over 10000 hip knee or shoulder replacementsurgeries are performed each year and this number as well as the number of associated PJIs continues toincrease. Treatment for PJI after hip knee or shoulder replacement surgery is important to the VA becauseosteoarthritis the most common reason for that surgery is the fifth most common condition among Veterans.Our pilot data and other studies have found that many PJI patients are prescribed CAS outside of guidelinerecommendations potentially due to physician fear of a relapse. This inappropriate use can lead to poorpatient outcomes (e.g. C. difficile infection antibiotic resistance) without any benefit.Research Plan: The specific aims of this study are: (1) Define patient infection and treatment characteristicsthat identify patients who would benefit from de-implementation of CAS; (2) Define current provider CASprescribing processes and evaluate barriers and facilitators to changing those practices through interviews withhealth care providers; and (3) Create a decision model to conduct an economic evaluation of CAS use anddifferent interventions to de-implement inappropriate CAS use. We expect to document significant variations inCAS prescribing and identify cost-effective interventions to de-implement CAS or reduce its duration. We propose a 3-year mixed methods study to inform efforts for CAS de-implementation. Aim 1 will use aCorporate Data Warehouse (CDW) database of ~7500 PJI patients treated at all VA hospitals in aretrospective cohort comparative effectiveness study to determine specific characteristics that identify thosePJI patients who will benefit from CAS de-implementation. These characteristics may include young ageinfection with a non-virulent pathogen initial receipt of appropriate antibiotics for PJI caused byStaphylococcus aureus or receipt of 2-stage exchange surgery. In Aim 2 we will visit 8 diverse hospitalsqualitatively explore the contexts that contribute to CAS use and elicit barriers and facilitators to changingprescribing practices. Aim 3 will create an innovative decision analytical model of potential interventions to de-implement CAS or reduce its duration. Our findings will be provided to the VA Antimicrobial Stewardship TaskForce to assist in antibiotic de-implementation efforts and will provide needed data to design a futurerandomized controlled trial of an intervention to de-implement CAS among patients who do not need it.Implications: Our study will provide important insights into the organizational culture and broader externalcontext (e.g. professional social) associated with over-prescribing antibiotics for infections after surgery. Wewill identify targets for antimicrobial stewardship and identify clinical situations in which antibiotic use can bede-implemented. Given the increasing use of implants such as prosthetic joints cardiac pacemakers and leftventricular assist devices the use of CAS is expected to rise. Our research will help VA providers de-implement antibiotics for patients who do not need them in order to decrease antibiotic resistance in the VHAand prevent adverse events such as C. difficile infections.","Adverse event;Advisory Committees;Age;Americas;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotic-resistant organism;Antibiotics;Bacteria;Cardiac pacemaker;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clostridium difficile;Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria;Communicable Diseases;Data;Data Set;Databases;Decision Making;Decision Modeling;Degenerative polyarthritis;Deimplementation;Fright;Funding;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health Personnel;Hip region structure;Hospitals;Immunocompetent;Implant;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Intervention;Intervention Trial;Interview;Intravenous;Joint Prosthesis;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knee;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Methods;Modeling;Nurses;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Organizational Culture;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Physical therapy;Physicians;Positioning Attribute;Process;Provider;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Relapse;Repeat Surgery;Research;Resistance to infection;Retrospective cohort;Risk;Role;Shoulder;Societies;Staphylococcus aureus;System;Testing;Treatment Failure;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Variant;Veterans;Visit;Work;antibiotic resistant infections;antimicrobial;base;cohort;comparative effectiveness study;cost;cost effective;cost effective intervention;data warehouse;design;economic evaluation;economic impact;fungus;implementation efforts;implementation intervention;implementation strategy;infection rate;innovation;insight;joint infection;left ventricular assist device;mathematical model;operation;pathogen;patient population;patient subsets;prevent;social;treatment risk","Chronic Antibiotic Suppression after Prosthetic Joint Infection: A Target for De-implementation","Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is an infection that occurs after hip knee or shoulder replacement surgery.Chronic antibiotic suppression (CAS) defined as indefinite use of oral antibiotics (lasting between 6 months to10 years) following an initial course of antibiotics is frequently used to treat PJIs.

The overall goal of the proposed study is to create a cost-effective intervention to decrease overuse ofCAS.

"No NIH Category available","A primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly is thrombotic complications includingmyocardial infarction and stroke and these events are the leading cause of hospitalization inVeteran Health Administration (VA) system. However the mechanisms of thrombosis due toaging are understudied in VA patients. Secondly risk factors that are encountered during mid-life may exacerbate outcome or lead to an early event in life. For example due to obesityendemic the incidence of pre-diabetes in US is increasing with current estimates indicating that37% of adults are pre-diabetic. Amongst Veterans one in four have diabetes and over 70% ofVeterans receiving VA care are obese. Likewise a high incidence of prediabetes is alsoapparent in VA patients. Given Veterans are at higher risk for cardiovascular events which arefrequently associated with previously undiagnosed diabetes understanding early age-relatedmechanisms in mid-life Veterans with or without prediabetes is necessary to develop preventivestrategies for future vascular events. We have established that increased thromboticsusceptibility in middle-aged/older mice is associated with increased platelet activation andreactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation though the underlying mechanisms are unclear.In pilot studies we have made the novel observation that sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) a well-establishedanti-aging gene is markedly decreased in platelets from aged vs. young human or mice. SIRT3is a mitochondrial deacetylase that finely controls the activity of several electron transport chain(ETC) proteins and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) to cumulatively regulate ROS levels but itsrole in platelet activation is not clear. We have now generated proof of principle datademonstrating that inhibition of SIRT3 leads to increased platelet activation and its activationreduces aggregation. Therefore our central hypothesis is that in middle aged Veterans lossof SIRT3 promotes mitochondrial ROS accumulation in platelets leading to platelet hyperactivityand increased thrombotic susceptibility and that this phenotype is accentuated by presence ofobesity and pre-diabetes. Specific Aim 1 will define the mechanistic role of SIRT3 in regulationof mitochondrial ROS levels platelet activation and increased thrombotic susceptibility in mid-life Veterans. Specific Aim 2 will examine whether pre-diabetes modulates early-age onset ofSIRT3-mediated mitochondrial ROS accumulation platelet hyperactivation and exacerbatesthrombotic susceptibility in mid-life Veterans.","Adult;Adverse effects;Age;Age of Onset;Aging;Agonist;Bioenergetics;Blood Platelets;Blood Vessels;Blood coagulation;Caring;Chronic;Data;Deacetylase;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Elderly;Electron Transport;Event;Exhibits;Future;Health Care Costs;Hospitalization;Human;Hyperactivity;Incidence;Lead;Life;Mediating;Metabolic;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Proteins;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Obesity;Outcome;Patients;Phenotype;Pilot Projects;Platelet Activation;Prediabetes syndrome;Predisposition;Prevention strategy;Proteins;Quality of life;Reaction;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;SOD2 gene;Sirtuins;Source;Stroke;Superoxides;System;Testing;Thrombosis;Thrombus;Tissues;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;age effect;age related;aged;aging gene;anti aging;antioxidant enzyme;base;burden of illness;cardiovascular risk factor;circulating biomarkers;cohort;early onset;high risk;metabolomics;middle age;mortality;novel;platelet function;stroke event;thrombogenesis;thrombotic;thrombotic complications","Thrombogenic susceptibility in middle aged Veterans","Veterans are at increased risk for heart attack and stroke as they age.

"No NIH Category available","Parkinson's disease (PD) culminates in dementia immobility and death at a huge societal cost. Even early inthe course motor and cognitive dysfunction impairs instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Non-motorsymptoms due to fatigue mood sleep and autonomic disorders further reduce quality of life (QoL). DTI showsprogressive decline in brain tissue integrity. Usual care of PD centers on medical and surgical treatmentsrelieve motor symptoms but these cause side effects and lose efficacy over time. Usual treatment for non-motor manifestations with pharmaceuticals (e.g. antidepressants) is symptomatic and not specific for PD.Acetylcholine esterase inhibitors exert modest symptomatic benefits on dementia but there is no approvedtreatment for mild cognitive impairment. Physical Therapy is usually prescribed in later stages when mobilityimpairment ensues. There is no approved standard exercise regimen for PD. There is no cure or diseasemodifying treatment. Thus there is a critical need for treatments that provide broad spectrum of benefits andslow PD. Preliminary research suggests that aerobic exercise has potential to meet this need. Howeveraerobic exercise is demanding and carries some risks. It is unknown if aerobic exercise is more beneficial thanusual care in PD in long term due to gaps in our knowledge about the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF)on brain tissue integrity motor function cognition IADL QoL and disease progression. Limitations of currentstudies include short duration small sample size lack or inadequacy of controls lack of outcome measures forcognition and IADL and lack of biological markers to measure progression. Our objective in this application isto fill the translational gap by determining the biological clinical and functional effects of long term aerobicexercise (LTAE) in PD. Our overall hypothesis is that LTAE improves brain tissue integrity and slowsdown PD. Our FIRST AIM is to determine the effects of LTAE on clinical features and functional abilities in PD.Our prior 6-month uncontrolled trial showed preliminary evidence that aerobic exercise improves aspects ofmotor function cognition and QoL in PD but long term outcomes and implication for functional abilities areunknown. We hypothesize that LTAE will provide sustained improvement in motor function cognition and non-motor symptoms with translation of benefits to QoL and IADL. We will test this with a one-year randomizedcontrolled trial (RCT) that compares the effects of moderate aerobic exercise vs usual care. We will use drivingas the outcome for IADL. Driving represents an important symbol for independence and depends on integrityof cognitive and motor systems. Our SECOND AIM is to determine the mechanism of LTAE effects in PD. CRFreflects complex improvements in vascular cardiac and metabolic health from aerobic exercise. There ispreliminary evidence that higher CRF is associated with better brain health and motor/cognitive function andthat aerobic exercise improves these outcomes. For example our preliminary study showed improvement ofmicrotissue integrity in the striatum and white matter on DTI but it is unclear how these changes counteractPD progression over long term. Our hypotheses are: 1) LTAE will improve brain tissue integrity as indexed byDTI 2) LTAE effects on motor and cognitive function are mediated by changes in brain tissue integrity on DTIand 3) physiological processes leading to improved CRF from AE are critical to the benefits on the brain tissueintegrity and motor/cognitive function. We will test these hypotheses determining the effects of LTAE on CRFand DTI and the association between individual differences in training-related changes in motor and cognitivefunction DTI and CRF. In summary our proposal leverages our diverse interdisciplinary team strongpreliminary data and past work and unique infrastructure to determine if LTAE slows down neurodegenerationand clinical disability in PD.","Acetylcholine;Activities of Daily Living;Adverse event;Aerobic;Aerobic Exercise;Aging;American;Animals;Antidepressive Agents;Automobile Driving;Autonomic nervous system disorders;Biological;Biological Markers;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cardiac;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cognition;Cognitive;Complex;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Dementia;Disease;Disease Progression;Fatigue;Health;Human;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Individual;Individual Differences;Infrastructure;Knowledge;Long-Term Effects;Measures;Mediating;Medical;Metabolic;Monitor;Mood Disorders;Motor;Movement;Nerve Degeneration;Neuronal Plasticity;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Physical therapy;Physiological Processes;Quality of life;Randomized Controlled Trials;Research;Research Design;Risk;Sample Size;Sleep Disorders;Structure;Symptoms;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Training;Translations;Uncontrolled Study;VO2max;Veterans;Work;brain health;brain tissue;cardiorespiratory fitness;cognitive function;cost;disability;esterase inhibitor;exercise regimen;functional outcomes;improved;improved outcome;indexing;instrumental activity of daily living;mental function;mild cognitive impairment;motor disorder;motor function improvement;motor impairment;motor symptom;non-motor symptom;relating to nervous system;side effect;societal costs;treatment as usual;trial comparing;white matter","Long Term Aerobic Exercise to Slow Progression in Parkinson's Disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) is an incurable brain illness that afflicts more than one million Americans includingmany of our aging veterans.

"No NIH Category available","Optic neuritis is an associated pathology of MS and is often the first symptom of the disease. Even in MSpatients without any known episodes of optic neuritis there is evidence that functional and structuralmanifestations of MS in the anterior visual pathway can be detected and monitored in vivo reflecting diseaseactivity. These include contrast sensitivity critical flicker fusion frequency evoked potentials from the retinaand brain and inner retinal layer thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Our main purpose is toestablish sensitive biomarkers of visual function that can be made widely available to veterans suffering fromMS for detecting MS relapses progression and treatment effects. An important secondary rehabilitation goal isto determine which conventional and new experimental treatment could decrease fluctuation in visual and CNSfunction which are known to impact quality of life in preclinical animal models of MS.We will employ two relevant animal models of MS a MOG-induced experimental autoimmuneencephalomyelitis (EAE) model for chronic MS and PLP-induced EAE to mimic the relapsing-remitting form.We will also include a heat-induced stress test to trigger fluctuations in visual and CNS function in EAE mice.We will determine in vivo ocular structural and functional biomarkers and will correlate them with motor-sensory and cognitive function. Data will be related to ex vivo structural manifestations of MS namely neuronloss and demyelination. We propose that the number of remaining neurons and their myelin integrity willcorrelate with changes in optic nerve conduction speed visual acuity and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. Wewill then examine if current treatments using Fingolimod 4-aminopyridine and a ketogenic diet increase neuro-axonal electrical activity and decrease functional fluctuation to favor increased rehabilitation. Newerexperimental therapies derived from compounds hypothesized to mediate the therapeutic effects ofmesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy which targeting improved nerve transduction will also be tested in thechronic and relapsing remitting models of MS.Supported by pilot data results we will determine with additional rigor that decreased optic nerve conductionvelocity precedes motor-sensory and structural deficits in the EAE model and represents an early marker ofdisease activity. Our expected data will provide insights on how impairment of visual function corresponds todemyelination retinal thinning and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss. We also determine at what time point anearlier treatment intervention will improve long-term functional and structural outcome.

Unfortunately there is a significant disparity in utilization of mentalhealth (MH) care and VA access as most war Veterans dont seek needed care. Newinterventions are urgently needed to address disparities in post-deployment MH treatmentengagement for our war Veterans and to support VAs efforts to provide them with optimalaccess and care. Online health interventions have been shown to be preferred by OEF/OIFcombat Veterans and have the potential to promote access to VA MH care. Our research teamhas developed a web-based interface (WEB-ED) evolved by feedback from Veterans thatscreens for common post-deployment MH and readjustment concerns provides tailorededucation about positive screens and facilitates linkage to VA resources. Data from our priorstudies demonstrate WEB-ED can be successfully implemented within VA and activateVeterans to seek needed care. Furthermore emerging evidence indicates that when patientsare educated about their health conditions and treatment alternatives using shared decision-making (SDM) increased treatment participation and adherence and better health outcomesresult. Next steps include: linking Veteran WEB-ED screening results to a VA secure network sothat a provider can access the results; and integrating a SDM interface to promote Veteran-Provider partnerships in patient-centered care. We propose a three phase study to address ouraims. Aim 1 (phase 1) we will gather qualitative information from key VA and Veteran informantsto create an enhanced version (WEB-ED+) of our Current WEB-ED that includes an eHealthand SDM interface. Aim 2 (phase 2) will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test WEB-ED+ vs. Current WEB-ED in promoting VA MH care engagement. Aim 3 (phase 3) we willemploy a process evaluation to determine the feasibility and acceptability of WEB-ED+ for bothVeterans and VA practitioner and to document the VA processes Veterans use to enroll andengage in VA MH care. This study will improve our understanding of the most effective methodsto reduce barriers to enrollment in VA/MHV and transferring important medical information usingMy HealtheVet (MHV). Furthermore it will provide important information regarding how WEB-ED results can enhance the capability of VA providers and transition patient advocates to useVeterans screening results to triage and engage Veterans in patient-centered MH care andpromote VA provider adoption of WEB-ED+ to facilitate patient engagement.

"No NIH Category available","Background: Surgery can precipitate the development of both chronic pain and long-term opioid use.Preoperative psychological distress is a risk factor for poor post-surgical outcomes. Strategies are needed toaugment perioperative pharmacotherapeutic management of pain with non-pharmacologic strategies tooptimize post-operative outcomes. Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) caneffectively reduce distress and improve functioning among patients with chronic pain. While CBT has beenused extensively in patients with established chronic pain it has not been used as a preventive interventiontargeting the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain. Significance/Impact: This proposal addresses the priority areas of chronic pain and opioid use. This studyenhances biopsychosocial pain care during the perioperative period and offers a model to prevent thedevelopment of chronic pain and prolonged opioid use following surgery. Innovation: The proposed innovative approach to preventing rather than managing chronic postsurgicalpain among Veterans could incite a clinical paradigm shift from pain treatment to prevention. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Use a Hybrid Type 1 Randomized Controlled Trial design to examine the efficacy ofthe Perioperative Pain Self-management (PePS) program versus Standard Care (SC) for preventing chronicpostoperative pain and prolonged opioid use. Exploratory analyses will examine whether substance usedisorders moderate treatment effects and whether changes in pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy relate topostoperative pain at 6-months post-surgery. Aim 2: Determine the impact of the PePS program on secondaryoutcomes: mood functioning and non-opioid analgesic prescriptions. Aim 3: Evaluate the context ofimplementation by examining acceptability feasibility and appropriateness among Veterans and care teammembers and quantifying intervention-specific personnel-related costs. Based on the ImplementationOutcomes framework the current study will use primarily qualitative methodology for aim 3. Methodology: The current study is a hybrid efficacy-implementation design to facilitate a more rapid movetoward broad-based dissemination and uptake of the PePS program. For Aim 1 and 2 we will utilize a single-blind two-arm parallel randomized control trial. Participants will include 400 Veterans scheduled at the IowaCity or Minneapolis VAs for unilateral primary total joint arthroplasty. Participants will be randomized to PePSor SC. The PePS program includes 4 telephone sessions: Session one will be preoperative and include anintroduction to relaxation and the importance of interpretation in the pain experience. Session two (two weekspostoperative) will include: review of relaxation and the connection between thoughts/interpretation and painand introduction to thought records. Session three will include review of thought records and relaxation andintroduction to goal-setting and cognitive restructuring. Session four will include: review and creating a plan forcontinued use of skills. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured for 6 weeks post-surgery(medications only) and at 3 months and 6 months post-surgery (all other outcomes). Six-months will be theprimary endpoint for pain mood and functioning. Multivariate logistic regression will be employed to determinethe relationship between treatment arm and the dichotomous outcome: moderate to severe pain at 6-monthspost-surgery. Survival analyses will be used to determine time to opioid (and other analgesic) cessation. Aim 3 will assess acceptability appropriateness feasibility and estimate costs associated with subsequentimplementation. This will include qualitative interviews with both Veteran surgical patients and surgery clinicstaff (surgeons nurses and clerks) at both sites. We will use micro-costing to quantify work time. Implementation/Next Steps: These findings will be used to inform subsequent implementation work of thePePS program within the VA healthcare system.","Acute;Address;Affect;Analgesics;Anxiety;Area;Arthritis;Caring;Chronic;Cities;Clinic;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive Therapy;Coping Skills;Data;Development;Disease;Dissemination and Implementation;Distress;Future;General Population;Goals;Guidelines;Healthcare Systems;Human Resources;Hybrids;Incidence;Intervention;Interview;Iowa;Joints;Logistic Regressions;Measures;Methodology;Modeling;Moods;Nurses;Operative Surgical Procedures;Opioid;Orthopedic Surgery;Outcome;Pain;Pain management;Participant;Patients;Perioperative;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Postoperative Pain;Postoperative Period;Prevention;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Records;Relaxation;Replacement Arthroplasty;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Schedule;Self Efficacy;Severities;Single-Blind Study;Site;Substance Use Disorder;Surgeon;Survival Analysis;Telephone;Thinking;Time;Veterans;Work;arm;base;biopsychosocial;chronic pain;chronic pain patient;comorbidity;control trial;cost;cost estimate;design;efficacy evaluation;evidence base;experience;follow-up;implementation design;implementation outcomes;implementation strategy;improved;improved functioning;innovation;member;microcosting;non-opioid analgesic;opioid overuse;opioid use;pain catastrophizing;pain reduction;pain self-management;pilot trial;prescription pain reliever;prevent;preventive intervention;primary endpoint;primary outcome;psychologic;psychological distress;secondary outcome;sedative;self-management program;skills;standard care;surgery outcome;treatment arm;treatment effect;trial design;uptake","Preventing Chronic Post-Surgical Pain and Prolonged Opioid Use: The Perioperative Pain Self-Management Program","Surgery can precipitate the development of both chronic pain and long-term opioid use.

"No NIH Category available","Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease in which the hair follicle is the target of attackand results clinically in hair loss. The lifetime risk of developing AA is approximately 2% translating to over 6million people in the United States developing the disease at some point in their lives. Although often beingdismissed as a cosmetic concern AA can have a substantive psychosocial impact and can significantly affectthe quality of life of affected individuals especially among those with the more severe forms. The populationthat suffers from this disfiguring disease with significant psychosocial ramifications represents a significant unmetmedical need. In addition autoimmune diseases in general are rising in prevalence and at least one study ofveterans have shown an increased risk of autoimmune disease in those veterans suffering from post-traumaticstress disorder. The common cause hypothesis of autoimmunity supported by the association of specific genesto a range of autoimmune diseases signifies that advances in one autoimmune disease may be applicable toothers. Numerous factors make AA an attractive area of study in this regard: high prevalence the existence ofan animal model with high fidelity to human disease and the ease and convenience with which the target end-organ may be assessed and sampled. Despite its high prevalence AA has not been as heavily studied relative to other cutaneous autoimmunediseases and there are no treatments approved by the US FDA that list AA as an indication. Despite new interestand data into the immune mechanisms regulating the development of AA our understanding of the pathogenicimmune cell types and regulatory circuits that drive this disease significantly lags that of other autoimmunediseases. Although prior work by us and others have established a critical role for CD4 and CD8 T cells it is notknown what these cell types are doing to lead to autoimmune attack of the hair follicle. Dissecting which effectorfunctions of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells are necessary for AA pathogenesis will focus our understanding ofdisease pathogenesis which can bring us closer to targeted and specific treatments. AA is characterized histologically by a peribulbar immune infiltrate mostly comprised of T cells withCD4 T cells being the most numerous cell type followed by CD8 T cells. We are interested in investigating therole of pathogenic CD4 and CD8 T cells in the context of the C3H/HeJ murine model of AA which can eitherdevelop disease spontaneously or develop disease in response to various methods of induction. The goal ofthis proposal is to address these critical knowledge gaps and provide mechanistic insight into the role of CD4and CD8 T cells in the pathogenesis of AA. We will achieve our goal by pursuing two specific Aims. InSpecific Aim 1 we will dissect the impact of CD4 T cell production of interferon gamma on the hair follicle andAA development. Furthermore our proposed studies will help define the target of CD4 T cell effector functionsin our in vivo model. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine which effector mechanisms are required by CD8 Tcells for AA development. We expect our studies to identify the pathogenic effector functions used by T cells toinduce disease in AA.

Studies have shown that veterans especially those sufferingfrom post-traumatic stress disorder are at an increased risk. The common cause hypothesis of autoimmunityposits that similar mechanisms are responsible for groups of autoimmune diseases supported by common setsof genes associated with clusters of autoimmune diseases. Advances in one particular autoimmune diseasemay therefore be applicable to others. The submitted proposal examines pathogenic mechanisms in alopeciaareata (AA) in which the hair follicle is the subject of immune attack. In line with the common cause hypothesisAA is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune thyroiditis and diabetes among other autoimmunediseases. AA is a highly prevalent autoimmune disease with a lifetime risk of 1 in 50 according to US-basedstudies. We therefore submit that results achieved in our current proposal are expected to benefit large numbersof US citizens and of particular relevance for veteran and combat veteran populations.","VA","10183173","8/30/2021","BX-19-001","5I01BX004907-02","5","I01","BX","004907","02","","","7/1/2020","6/30/2024","ZRD1-IMMA-G(01)"," ","78187486","JABBARI, ALI ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","US","41.653383","-91.540485","481031","IOWA CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER","IOWA CITY","IA","Independent Hospitals","522462208","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2021","6/30/2022"," ","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2021"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","Glaucoma is one of the most common causes of irreversible vision loss and blindness world wide. The diseaseaffects a large number of veterans and degrades their quality of life. Loss of vision is ultimately due to thedegeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) which are required to convey visual information from the retinalphotoreceptors to the visual centers of the brain. It is currently unclear what initially causes the damage toRGC. It has been well established that the degeneration of the RGC is accompanied by retinal neuroinflammationcharacterized by microglial activation expression of proinflammatory molecules upregulation of MHC IImolecules and retinal synthesis of components of the complement cascade. Preliminary data included in thisapplication demonstrate that glaucomatous RGC degeneration also elicits a cellular autoimmune response inmouse models of the disease. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes or T cells but not B cells from glaucomatousmice into healthy normotensive recipients elicits slow and progressive loss of RGC. Other cell types of theretina do not appear to be affected. Importantly we further demonstrate that transfer of immune cells fromhuman glaucoma patients into immune deficient mice also leads to specific RGC loss in the recipient mice.This was invariably the case when material from patients with disc hemorrhages (a clinical sign of ongoingglaucomatous degeneration) was used. Material from patients with glaucoma but without a disk hemorrhagecauses RGC loss in mice to a varying degree. Transfer of cells from healthy controls causes no damage.We hypothesize that the amount of RGC loss in the mouse is correlated to the vision loss that will beexperienced by the donating patient in the coming months. Thus transfer of immune cells from human patientsto the mouse is a predictor of future damage and can serve to identify those patients who would benefit fromaggressive clinical interventions. Early and maximal treatment could serve to prevent loss of vision and declineof quality of life in affected veterans. This proposal will test this hypothesis by obtaining blood derived immunecells from veterans with primary open angle glaucoma. These cells will be transferred to the mice and theresulting damage will be quantitated. Patients will be re-examined after two years and the degree of vision lossand decline of quality of life will be correlated to RGC loss in the mouse model. Additional experiments areproposed to further define the type of immune cell mediating this phenomenon. Finally we will determine ifimmune modulation in the recipient mouse can prevent RGC loss. If successful these data might point out newapproaches to prevent progressive vision loss in glaucoma patients.The concept of a T cell based autoimmune response associated with vision loss in glaucoma is very innovativeand has potentially significant clinical ramifications. The development of a predictive assay based upon thisresponse would provide clinicians with a new tool to identify those patients most at risk for the slow but steadydecline in vision noted in too many veterans.","Adoptive Transfer;Affect;Animals;Appointment;Attenuated;Autoimmune Responses;Autoimmunity;B-Lymphocytes;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Biological Testing;Blindness;Blood;Brain;Cell Survival;Cell physiology;Cells;Cities;Clinical;Clinical Management;Complement;Data;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Doctor of Philosophy;Early identification;Exhibits;Familiarity;Future;Glaucoma;Goals;Hemorrhage;Homeostasis;Human;Immune;Immunologist;Individual;International;Intervention;Iowa;Laboratories;Lymphocyte Subtypings;Mediating;Medical center;Methodology;Methods;Modality;Mononuclear;Mus;Ophthalmologist;Ophthalmology;Patient Transfer;Patients;Phenotype;Prevention;Primary Open Angle Glaucoma;Prognosis;Publishing;Quality of life;Reaction;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Research Personnel;Retina;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Retinal Photoreceptors;Risk;Services;Specialist;Splenocyte;Stable Disease;Symptoms;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Universities;Up-Regulation;Veterans;Vision;Visual;aggressive therapy;base;cell type;disorder risk;expectation;experience;experimental study;ganglion cell;high risk;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;innovation;mouse model;neuroinflammation;normotensive;novel;novel strategies;patient population;predictive test;preservation;prevent;response;restoration;retinal damage;retinal ganglion cell degeneration;tool;visual information","Bioassay to Predict the Development and Progression of Glaucoma","This proposal is based preliminary data demonstrating the very novel concept that glaucomatous degenerationin human patients is associated with the development of a cellular autoimmune response that can be detectedand quantitated in vivo by transferring the patients' immune cell to immune deficient mice.

"No NIH Category available","Leishmaniasis refers to a constellation of disease syndromes caused by the Leishmania spp.protozoa. Leishmaniasis affects persons residing in endemic regions including the sites of recentand ongoing US military activities in the Middle East. Common forms of leishmaniasis include visceralleishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum or L. donovani or cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)often due to L. major or L. tropica in the Middle East and northern Africa. A common feature of thedifferent forms of leishmaniasis is their propensity to cause asymptomatic infections particularly inhealthy hosts. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic leishmaniasis varies from 6.5:1 in to >100:1in different endemic regions. Due to the poor ability to recover parasites in culture and imprecisemarkers for infection diagnosis of asymptomatic infections can be elusive. The mechanisms and theconsequences of these occult infections are largely unknown. Methods to recognize asymptomatic leishmaniasis have improved leading to a recent reportthat nearly 20% of soldiers deployed to endemic regions of Iraq during 2002-2011 have evidence ofongoing L. infantum infection in their bloodstream. Leishmaniasis is a disease associated withchronic inflammation and we do not know the consequences of long-term asymptomatic infection withthis protozoan. Furthermore asymptomatically infected soldiers are at risk for developingsymptomatic disease if immunocompromise occurs in later years. All eukaryotic cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) into their environment. The subset ofEVs called exosomes are known to transmit bioactive proteins microRNAs metabolic enzymes andlipids between cells or throughout the bloodstream. Our preliminary studies show that exosomes fromL. infantum induce an inflammatory state in human cells and in murine skin which phenocopies theinflammatory state induced by the infectious parasite. This finding led us to hypothesize that at leastsome of the inflammatory responses induced during leishmaniasis are caused by exosomes releasedfrom intact parasites or from leishmania-infected cells. Aims of the current application are: Aim #1: To document the differences in protein and miRNA content of EVs released by different species of Leishmania or by nave or Leishmania-exposed myeloid cells.Aim #2: To query to what extend the components of EVs are responsible for host inflammatory responses in murine models of leishmaniasis both locally and systemically.Aim #3: To document differences between EVs circulating in serum or released in urine of healthy humans or people with asymptomatic or symptomatic Leishmania spp. infections.Through these studies we will address the hypothesis that Leishmania infection causes the release ofEVs whose contents induce many of the systemic inflammatory responses associated withLeishmania spp. infections. We hope that these findings will inspire the design of novel therapeuticand/or diagnostic approaches to leishmaniasis.","Address;Affect;Afghanistan;Bite;Blood Banks;Blood Circulation;Brazil;Cells;Central America;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinical;Country;Cutaneous Leishmaniasis;Detection;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Environment;Enzymes;Eukaryotic Cell;European;Exposure to;Geographic Locations;Goals;Health;Human;Immune response;Immunocompromised Host;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Iraq;Leishmania;Leishmania donovani;Leishmania infantum;Leishmaniasis;Lipids;Measures;Metabolic;Methods;MicroRNAs;Middle East;Military Personnel;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Northern Africa;Parasites;Pathogenicity;Persons;Phenocopy;Phenotype;Proteins;Protozoa;Reporting;Risk;Sand Flies;Serum;Signal Transduction;Site;Skin;Small RNA;Soldier;Source;South America;Syndrome;Urine;Vesicle;Visceral;Visceral Leishmaniasis;antigen diagnostic;design;exosome;extracellular vesicles;improved;keratinocyte;low and middle-income countries;member;microbicide;microvesicles;military operation;mouse model;novel therapeutics;pathogen;systemic inflammatory response;vector;vesicular release","Extracellular vesicles from parasite and host in leishmaniasis","Leishmaniasis is a diverse set of parasitic syndromes that affect individuals living in the manyendemic regions.

"No NIH Category available","Our microbiome influences how our immune system functions. Our microbiome has changed as aresult of living in highly hygienic industrialized countries. A major change in our microbiome is loss of exposureto helminths (parasitic worms). Prior to the 1940's helminth colonization was nearly universal and there isstrong evidence that this exposure helped to shape our genome. Loss of these previously ubiquitous membersof our paleobiome can have far ranging immunologic effect. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) currentlyafflicts more than one million Americans and many thousands of veterans. The incidence of IBD and otherimmune-mediated diseases increased dramatically after the 1940's in North America and Europe. Thesediseases are rare in less developed tropical countries. Veterans that served in Vietnam or were prisoners ofwar are at lower risk of developing IBD than are other veterans. Moreover as countries develop economicallythe incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increase. Now IBD is a globally emergingdisorder. Although specific genes predispose to IBD there is strong evidence that a change in environmentconcurrent with socioeconomic improvement confers risk for developing the disorder. We propose that achange from our historic paleobiome i.e. the lack of helminth exposure in developed countries is animportant risk factor for developing IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. We and others haveshown that colonization with helminths protects mice from immune-mediated colitis encephalitis diabetes andairway disease. These are models of diseases that have emerged within highly industrialized countries.Understanding how helminth exposure decreases immune mediated diseases will guide development oftargeted therapy to prevent or treat those diseases. Th17 cells control pro-inflammatory pathologicalresponses like that of IBD. Recently it has become clear that Th17 cells are heterogeneous. In addition tomaking IL17 highly pro-inflammatory Th17 cells make IFN. Other Th17 cells with a regulatory phenotypeexpress FoxP3 or make IL10. Immune mediated disease likely results from dysregulated Th17 plasticity. Wediscovered that mucosal IL17 production is inhibited by exposure to helminths and that this exposuredecreases Th17IFN+ and increases Th17IL10+ percentages in lamina propria and mesenteric lymph nodecell populations. Moreover we find that helminth exposure alters Treg plasticity and in the absence of T cellStat6-signaling massively induces a novel Foxp3+IFN+ population. Our hypothesis is that helminthexposure protects against colitis by altering Th17 and Treg heterogeneity/plasticity. This project will testthis hypothesis with 3 specific aims. Our first aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposurethat alter Th17 plasticity. Our second aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure thataugment Treg plasticity and the role of newly discovered musculin and TIGIT circuity in helminth-associatedTreg function. Our third aim will explore how helminth-induced changes in Th circuitry increases intestinalepithelial cell resistance to targeted injury. Our research is unique in that we are exploring possible rootcauses for the emergence of autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory disease in modern civilizations.In addition these studies will provide insight into how helminth-exposed individuals that live or served in lessdeveloped countries may respond to immunologic challenges. Furthermore we are examining in vivo howintestinal organisms alter immune pathways to influence chronic inflammatory diseases like those that afflictveterans.","Acute;Affect;Airway Disease;American;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Apoptotic;Archaeology;Area;Arthritis;Asthma;Attenuated;Autoimmune;Back;Celiac Disease;Cell Compartmentation;Cell Differentiation process;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Civilization;Clinical;Colitis;Country;Crohn&apos;s disease;Data;Developed Countries;Developing Countries;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Disease model;Encephalitis;Environment;Epithelial Cells;Europe;Exposure to;FOXP3 gene;Genome;Health;Helminths;Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte;Heterogeneity;Human;Human Microbiome;IL17 gene;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologics;In Vitro;Incidence;Individual;Infectious Agent;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Injury;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Interferon Type II;Interferons;Interleukin-10;Intestines;Lamina Propria;Link;Mediating;Modernization;Mucous Membrane;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;Nematoda;North America;Organism;Pathogenicity;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plant Roots;Population;Prisoner;Production;Rare Diseases;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Resistance;Resolution;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Site;Specimen;Susceptibility Gene;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Ulcerative Colitis;Veterans;Vietnam;War;atopy;cell injury;chronic inflammatory disease;experimental study;gut microbiome;helminth infection;immune health;immune system function;immunoregulation;in vivo;insight;intestinal epithelium;member;mesenteric lymph node;microbiome;microorganism;neglect;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;prevent;response;socioeconomics;targeted treatment","Modulation of Th17 plasticity by intestinal paleobiomic fauna","Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) are chronic debilitatingillnesses.

Immune-mediated diseases are rare in lessdeveloped countries where parasitic worm (helminth) infection is common. Veterans that were sent to areaswith helminths (like Vietnam) have a lower risk for IBD. Data suggest that helminths alter immune responsesand inhibit IBD. Helminths were part of our ancient microbiome (paleobiome) and our bodies evolved to expecthelminth infection. Loss of that exposure increases the risk for immune-mediated disease. We propose tostudy how helminths alter immune responses to inhibit IBD.

"No NIH Category available","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of injury among Veterans; an estimated 20% of recent Veteranshave experienced some form of TBI. Veterans can also acquire non-service related TBIs with over 2 millionAmericans having received some form of TBI. Many recent injuries have come via exposures to blast fromimprovised explosive devices. Blast explosions have affected service members from all American militaryengagements even without overt or extensive blast exposure. Individuals exposed to TBI may experienceailments such as headache and learning deficits and may be at increased risk for long-term maladies such asneurodegenerative or psychiatric diseases Blast-mediated TBI has also caused visual dysfunction amongaffected individuals. Visual dysfunction produced by TBI includes changes in light sensitivity ocular motilitydysfunction optic neuropathy and retinopathy and homonymous visual field loss from cortical damage. Evenwith mild TBI patients frequently report visual difficulties and a decreased visual quality of life that is notdetected by routine eye exams. These symptoms likely represent subclinical disease in the eye and brainwhich is underreported and may progress to more severe visual deficits. While both visual and cognitivedeficits manifest after blast exposure the relationship between damage in the retina and the brain has notbeen described and it is uncertain if visual damage after blast injury is a result of direct retinal injury opticnerve injury or retrograde degeneration due to neuron loss in visual processing centers of the brain.Establishing this relationship is critical to developing rehabilitative therapies in order to directly target theaffected neurons. Furthermore there has been difficulty modeling and testing the complexity of human visionand visual-cognitive relationships in laboratory models after blast exposure.This proposal addresses two needs that are impediments to improving Veterans quality of life throughrehabilitation. The first is the lack of visual and visual-cognitive testing outcomes in pre-clinical rodent modelsthat accurately reflect human visual processing. The outcomes of such animal models can also serve astranslational indicators that disease states diminish the quality of life or that treatments can improve quality oflife. Our proposal seeks to provide just such a pre-clinical rodent model. The second is lack of noninvasivenon-pharmacologic rehabilitation of visual function. Our proposal will address this gap by determining iftranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can leverage endogenous neuronal plasticity to rehabilitate visualfunction.Our central hypotheses are first that blast-mediated TBI results in synaptic dysregulation which can impair theability of neurons to function efficiently. Second we hypothesize that tDCS applied during visual rehabilitationtherapy will lead to improved visual outcomes and thus improved visual-cognitive relationships and quality oflife. We will analyze these using novel outcomes of vision and visual-cognitive relationships following TBI in amanner that reflects Veterans difficulties and quality of life  in addition to understanding how to rehabilitatethis dysfunction.","Accidents;Address;Affect;American;Animal Model;Biological Assay;Blast Injuries;Blindness;Brain;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Development;Devices;Disease;Explosion;Exposure to;Eye;Functional disorder;Goals;Headache;Human;Impairment;Individual;Injury;Laboratories;Learning;Location;Mediating;Mental disorders;Military Personnel;Modeling;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Ophthalmic examination and evaluation;Optic Nerve Injuries;Outcome;Patients;Pharmacology;Photic Stimulation;Photophobia;Preclinical Testing;Quality of life;Rattus;Rehabilitation therapy;Reporting;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Retrograde Degeneration;Risk;Rodent Model;Supportive care;Symptoms;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;TBI treatment;Terrorism;Testing;Tissues;Traumatic Brain Injury;Veterans;Vision;Visual;Visual Fields;Workplace;blast exposure;cell motility;cognitive testing;combat;experience;improved;mild traumatic brain injury;neuron loss;novel;optic nerve disorder;pre-clinical;response;service member;vision rehabilitation;visual dysfunction;visual processing","Development of translational visual quality of life outcomes and non-invasive rehabilitation of visual loss","Blast-mediated traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects military members and civilians as a direct result of combatworkplace accidents or intentional terrorist attacks.

"No NIH Category available","Continuing advances in detection and treatment have greatly increased the number of cancer survivors aswell as more Veterans living with cancer because of continued therapy. However while these therapiesprolong life they are accompanied by adverse effects that introduce functional limitations and significantlyreduce quality of life of Veterans. For example taxane and platinum-based chemotherapies produce verypainful and debilitating peripheral neuropathies that greatly diminish patients quality of life. These agents canalso cause dry eye syndrome (DES) and in the case of platinum-based therapies hearing loss and tinnitusdue to ototoxicity in 40-80% of adults. Currently no effective treatment exists to reduce the incidence of thesedebilitating side effects of therapy and they remain a significant unmet need in healthcare. In recent yearsevidence has accrued that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) an essential redox coenzyme plays animportant role in protection against axonal injury. This laboratory recently demonstrated that a naturallyoccurring vitamin B3 precursor of NAD+ nicotinamide riboside (NR; NIAGEN) can both prevent and reversepaclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in rodents. The main goal of this application is to obtain preclinicaldata to evaluate the ability NR to improve the quality of life and function of Veterans with cancer as well ascancer survivors who suffer the sequelae of chemotherapy. The proposed studies will focus on a platinumcompound cisplatin that is associated with a high incidence of painful peripheral neuropathy as well as oculartoxicity and ototoxicity. The first aim of this proposal will determine whether prophylactic treatment with NRprevents cisplatin-induced allodynia (hypersensitivity) to tactile and cool stimuli as well as blunts theaversive/affective dimension of the neuropathy. Hypersensitivity to tactile and cool stimuli will be assessed invehicle- and NR-treated rats by determining threshold to withdrawal from application of calibrated von Freyfilaments or a cool stimulus to the hind paw. The place escape avoidance paradigm will be used to assesschanges in the aversive/affective components of nociception. The second aim of the proposal will determinewhether prophylactic treatment with NR can prevent photophobia (light aversion) as well as cornealhypersensitivity and deficits in tear production induced by cisplatin. Photophobia will be assessed in vehicle-and NR-treated rats by measuring time spent in a brightly-lit chamber while corneal hypersensitivity will beassessed by changes in withdrawal responses to tactile stimulation of the cornea or degree of squintinginduced by application of hyperosmolar saline drops. Reflex and basal tear production will be assessed bySchirmer's test. The final aim of this proposal will determine whether prophylactic treatment with NR canprevent cisplatin-induced loss of hearing.

"No NIH Category available","Heart failure is the most common health concern for aging veterans. At the cellular and molecular level heartfailure is the result of cardiomyocyte contractile failure due to impairment of cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C)coupling process. E-C coupling is the central mechanism governing cardiomyocyte contraction. One criticalstructural component of EC coupling is the myocyte transverse (T)-tubule system. T-tubules are orderlyinvaginations of surface membrane into the cell interior and are critical for rapid electric excitation andsynchronous triggering of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and therefore coordinated contraction of eachcontractile unit throughout the entire myocyte. In failing myocytes from animal models and human patients weand others have shown that the regularly arrayed T-tubule system undergoes disruptive remodeling leading toaberrant intracellular Ca2+ release and compromised myocyte contractility. A long-term goal of my researchprogram is to achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying T-tubule damage in different typesof heart disease and to identify new strategies that can restore or repair T-tubule integrity and thereby improveor even rescue cardiac function. Towards identifying putative mechanisms for T-tubule repair we havedetected increased expression of Mitsugumin 53 (MG53 also known as TRIM72) in human failing hearts andanimal models of chronic heart failure. MG53 is a novel muscle-specific protein involved in membrane vesicletrafficking and membrane repair following acute injury. Our pilot data showed that exogenous MG53overexpression in short term protects against T-tubule damage but chronic long-term overexpression of MG53results in severe T-tubule disruption. These seemingly opposite data led to the hypothesis that MG53-mediatedmembrane repair is necessary in the short term to protect against T-tubule damage in response to cardiacstress whereas chronic long-term upregulation of MG53 leads to myocyte T-tubule membrane damage and E-C coupling dysfunction instead of membrane repair. We will test this hypothesis in three aims: 1) Determine therole of MG53 upregulation in T-tubule integrity and heart failure progression in cardiomyopathy; 2) Define themechanisms by which MG53 regulates T-tubule integrity in cardiomyocytes; and 3) Determine the molecularmechanism of MG53 upregulation in heart failure. Our study will define the role for long-term upregulation ofthe membrane repair protein MG53 in damage of the T-tubule membrane structure in human and mousemodels which is a completely unstudied area. Understanding these molecular mechanisms will provide a newplatform and guide us to design better MG53/T-tubule-targeted therapeutics for heart failure treatment bypromoting repairs while avoiding the side effects.","Acute;Aging;Animal Model;Area;Award;Biology;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiomyopathies;Cells;Chronic;Congestive Heart Failure;Coupling;Data;Disabled Persons;Electrophysiology (science);Failure;Functional disorder;Genetic;Goals;Health;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Hypertrophy;Heart failure;Human;Imaging Techniques;Impairment;In Situ;Injury;Knock-in;Knowledge;Left ventricular structure;Mediating;Membrane;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Myocardial;Myocardial Ischemia;Nuclear;Outcome;Overdose;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathology;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pilot Projects;Process;Protein Family;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Resources;Role;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Seminal;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structural Protein;Structure;Surface;System;TRIM Motif;Testing;Therapeutic;Transcriptional Activation;Transcriptional Regulation;Treatment Failure;Up-Regulation;Vesicle;Veterans;base;cardiogenesis;care costs;confocal imaging;design;heart function;human model;improved;insight;interdisciplinary approach;junctophilin;mouse model;mutant;myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor 2;novel;overexpression;pressure;programs;repair function;repaired;response;side effect;targeted treatment;trafficking;transcription factor;ubiquitin-protein ligase","Understanding the multifaceted functions of MG53 in heart failure pathogenesis","Heart failure is the most common health concern for aging veterans.

"No NIH Category available","T2D is a major health problem for US veterans that imposes significant physical financial and emotional tolls.Thus there is a strong and urgent need for an effective and widely applicable therapy.Excessive accumulation of lipids in beta cells is considered to contribute to the development of T2D.Experimental data supports that lipid overload activates multiple stress pathways including inflammation ERstress oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction ultimately leading to the loss of functional beta cellmass. We have found evidence that the accumulation of triglycerides (TG) in human islets from T2D donors isassociated with dysregulation of lipolysis a previously unrecognized defect in T2D islets that accelerates TGaccumulation in T2D islets. Glucose activates lipolysis in non-diabetic human islets but not in T2D islets.Furthermore our preliminary data indicates that the dysregulation of lipolysis impairs insulin secretion byreducing the stability of syntaxin1a (Stx1a) one of the SNARE complex proteins important for exocytosis.When we tested the impact of dysregulation of lipolysis using human pseudoislets in which the expression ofthe principal TG lipase (ATGL) is down-regulated ATGL deficient human pseudoislets showed excessive lipiddroplet (LD) accumulation and impaired insulin secretion along with proteasomal degradation of Stx1a.Importantly the reduction of Stx1a is a defect reported in human T2D islets. Thus we hypothesize that thedysregulation of lipolysis in response to glucose reduces the stability of Stx1a and impairs insulin secretion inT2D islets. To understand molecular mechanism behind the defects in T2D islets it will be imperative todetermine how glucose upregulates lipolysis in beta cells why glucose fails to upregulate lipolysis in T2Dislets and how the impairment in lipolysis reduces Stx1a. We will approach our questions using humanpseudoislets and INS1 cells as models since they exhibit similarity with human islets in LD formation theregulation of lipolysis and phenotypes of ATGL deficiency. We expect to obtain novel information regardinghow dysregulation of lipid mobilization causes beta cell dysfunction in T2D through the following aims.Specific aim 1: Determine a mechanism by which ATGL increases lipolysis in response to glucose innon-diabetic beta cellsWe will systematically test potential targets by which glucose increases lipolysis in INS1 cells and non-diabetichuman beta cells. Aim 1a will test which glucose generated signals regulates lipolysis in beta cells. Aim 1b-dwill test whether glucose increases lipolysis by modifying ATGL co-lipases or perilipins.Specific aim 2: Determine a mechanism by which lipolysis is dysregulated in type 2 diabetic beta cellsAim 1 dissects a mechanism by which glucose regulates lipolysis in beta cells. Leveraging on the informationfrom Aim 1 we will determine why T2D islets are unable to increase lipolysis in response to glucose and howwe can restore lipolysis in T2D islets.Specific Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that defective lipolysis destabilizes stx1a in T2D isletsStx1a is proposed to contribute to the impairment of insulin secretion in T2D as Stx1a is reduced in islets ofT2D models and human islets affected by T2D. However it has been unknown why Stx1a is reduced in T2Dislets. Our preliminary data implicates that the impairment of lipolysis may cause the reduction of Stx1a in T2Dislets. Thus we will test the hypothesis that reduced lipolysis contributes to the reduction of Stx1a in T2D isletsthrough accelerating degradation of Stx1a due to reduced palmitoylation.Our study combines pharmacological and molecular approaches to increase our understanding of thepathogenesis of beta cell dysfunction in T2D. The information obtained will potentially lead us to a novel targetthat improves beta cell function in T2D by restoring LD mobilization in beta cells.","Affect;Beta Cell;Cell physiology;Cells;Data;Defect;Development;Emotional;Event;Exhibits;Exocytosis;Failure;Fatty Acids;Functional disorder;Glucose;Goals;Health;High Prevalence;Human;Impairment;Inflammation;Lead;Lipase;Lipid Mobilization;Lipids;Lipolysis;Mental Depression;Modeling;Molecular;Nature;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Overnutrition;Oxidative Stress;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Pharmacology;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Prevalence;Process;Protein S;Regulation;Reporting;Role;SNAP receptor;Shiga-Like Toxin I;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structure of beta Cell of islet;Testing;Triglycerides;Type 2 diabetic;Veterans;base;blood glucose regulation;endocrine pancreas development;endoplasmic reticulum stress;functional decline;functional loss;improved;insulin granule;insulin secretion;insulin sensitivity;islet;knock-down;mitochondrial dysfunction;non-diabetic;novel;palmitoylation;perilipin;preservation;prevent;protein complex;response;syntaxin 1A","A role and regulation of glucose responsive lipolysis in pancreatic beta cells","Type 2 diabetes is the major health problem for US veterans that imposes significant physical financial andemotional tolls.

"No NIH Category available","Despite the association between gut microbiota and multiple sclerosis (MS) being increasinglyappreciated the mechanism through which gut bacteria and their metabolites modulate disease in MS is poorlyunderstood. We and others have shown a link between perturbations in the gut microbiota in MS patients. Gutdysbiosis a qualitative alteration in healthy gut microbiota is characterized by an increased abundance ofinflammation-promoting bacteria (pathobiont) and depletion of beneficial bacteria (symbionts). As MS is aninflammatory disease an increase in pathobionts and/or decrease in symbionts might promote pro-inflammatory environment influencing disease development and progression. Pathobionts are known topromote pro-inflammatory environment by causing increased intestinal permeability which leads to leaky gutsyndrome by allowing leakage of bacterial products (LPS and other inflammatory mediators) into the systemiccirculation. Increased systemic levels of gut permeability linked inflammatory mediators (GPLIMS) can induceinflammation through canonical and non-canonical pathways including suppression of specialized pro-resolvingmediators (SPMs) a set of naturally occurring molecules produced within our body to dampen inflammation. Itis important to highlight that gut microbiota help in production of SPMs from diet. Alteration in the ratio ofGPLIMs and SPMs could modulate the disease course and clinical outcomes. Additionally depletion ofsymbionts responsible for maintaining immune homeostasis can also promote a pro-inflammatory environmentby tilting balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses towards pro-inflammatory response.We have earlier reported that multiple gut bacteria associated with metabolism of dietary phytoestrogens intoEquol is depleted in MS patients thus highlighting a critical role of phytoestrogen metabolism in mediatingbeneficial effect of gut microbiome. Although an inverse correlation between leaky gut and Equol had beenreported in some inflammatory diseases its role in the pathobiology of MS is unknown. There is a knowledge gap in our understanding about the mechanism(s) of gut dysbiosis in MSpatients. To this end our proposal is significant and critical to fill this void by determining the relativecontributions of pathobionts (leaky gut syndrome) and symbionts (phytoestrogen metabolism) in MS. Our long-term goal is to determine mechanism(s) through which gut bacteria and their metabolites influence protectionfrom or predisposition/progression to MS. We hypothesize that gut dysbiosis promotes MS throughenrichment of pathobionts which leads to leaky gut syndrome in addition to depletion of beneficial Equolproducing gut bacteria. We therefore propose to determine the significance of leaky gut and Equol producinggut bacteria in the pathogenesis of MS in the following three aims. In the first aim we will test the hypothesisthat gut dysbiosis in MS patients results in leaky gut and increased pro-inflammatory (GPLIMs) and decreasedanti-inflammatory mediators specifically SPMs. Second aim will enable us to test the hypothesis that treatmentnave MS patients will have reduced levels of equol and equol producing bacteria compared to HCs. In the lastaim we will test the hypothesis that MS patients on disease modifying therapies (DMTs) will restore the levelsof SPMs and equol/equol synthesizing bacteria. By the end of this study we expect to identify the potentialmechanism by which gut dysbiosis influences clinical outcomes in MS patients especially the significance ofGPLIMs SPMs and Equol producing bacteria. We expect to identify potential therapeutic biomolecules suchas SPMs and gut commensal bacteria which can suppress disease in the murine model of MS. This projecthas the potential to discover an indigenous set of biomolecules that can be utilized in clinical medicine aspotential biomarkers. Thus data from our study will enable us to take a bench side discovery to the bedside inMS patients.","Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Bacteria;Biological Markers;Blood Circulation;Cities;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Medicine;Clinical Research;DNA;Data;Development;Diet;Disease;Equilibrium;Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis;Extravasation;Feces;Fiber;Generations;Genes;Goals;Homeostasis;Immune;Immune response;Indigenous;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Intestinal permeability;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Leaky Gut;Link;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Medical;Metabolism;Modeling;Mucous Membrane;Multiple Sclerosis;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient Recruitments;Patients;Phase;Phytoestrogens;Predisposition;Production;Prognostic Marker;Reporting;Research;Role;Sampling;Serum;Side;Surface;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Urine;Veterans;bench to bedside;cohort;commensal bacteria;daidzein;diagnostic biomarker;dietary;dysbiosis;equol;gut bacteria;gut dysbiosis;gut microbiome;gut microbiota;in vivo;inflammatory milieu;intestinal epithelium;mouse model;multiple sclerosis patient;novel;novel diagnostics;pathobiont;potential biomarker;stool sample;symbiont;therapeutic target","Effect of Gut Microbiome Dysbiosis in the Pathobiology of Multiple Sclerosis","MS is a relevant medical problem faced by Veterans and understanding the factors responsible fordisease predisposition as well as progression will help in the development of better treatment options for MS.Recent clinical studies in MS patients have provided a strong case for the role of the gut microbiome in thepathobiology of MS.

The ultimate goal is to apply this knowledge todevelopment of improved measures to both prevent and treat diseases involving lymphocytes as well as toinform the clinical selection of the optimal available treatments for a specific Veteran's tumor. The basicscience investigations that began in the applicant's laboratory 30 years ago are now leading to importantcollaborations with physician-scientists to translate the findings of these studies into treatments and clinicaltrials. The projects to be pursued during the proposed funding period of this SRCS award and their relevanceto Veteran health include the following.1) Define the role of the signaling protein TNF Receptor Associated Protein 3 (TRAF3) as a tumor suppressorin B cell cancers. B cell lymphoma (BCL) and multiple myeloma (MM) the most common cancers oflymphocytes in humans are over-represented in the Veteran population. In both BCL and MM loss-of-functionTRAF3 mutations are common and the applicant discovered that post-translational loss of TRAF3 protein canalso occur. The proposed project will continue to define how TRAF3 restrains survival pathways which whendysregulated contribute to BCL/MM pathogenesis define how TRAF3 regulates BCL metabolism determinethe mechanisms and biological consequences of post-translational loss of TRAF3 protein in the B cells of aginghumans and develop new biomarkers for MM-initiating cells. Importantly all these projects will involve ongoingcollaborations with clinician colleagues. 2) Determine clinically-relevant roles of TRAF3 in other immune celltypes. The applicant's lab will continue studies revealing how TRAF3 enhances and regulates the function of Tlymphocytes critical to human immune responses to infectious disease and tumors. A new project incollaboration with two physician-scientists investigates the consequences of monoallelic TRAF3 disruption inhumans leading to chronic susceptibility to infections and autoimmunity. We strongly suspect that this geneticdefect is in fact much more widespread than previously appreciated. 3) Translate the applicant's knowledge ofCD40 function into clinical application. This involves projects that seek to optimize an antagonistic anti-humanCD40 antibody for use in blocking transplant rejection a clinical problem of relevance to Veterans and tounderstand the protective role played by CD40 in resistance to Ebola virus infection. 4) Provide key expertisein B lymphocyte biology to funded collaborative projects in MM and pancreatic cancer. Both these malignanciesoccur at higher-than-normal rates in the Veteran population.

"No NIH Category available","This application describes a structured research plan targeted to explore the role of the molecular clock which is responsible for maintaining endogenous circadian rhythm - in the mechanism of glucose regulationafter gastric bypass. It is estimated that ~ 30 million Americans have diabetes (mainly type 2) which has beentightly associated with insulin resistance and obesity. Furthermore 1 in every 3 Americans is currently obeseand by the year 2020 its estimated that ~ 75% will be either overweight or obese. Bariatric surgery proved tobe very effective in reducing body weight and reversing most of the obesity associated co-morbidities (suchas diabetes) with effects lasting as long as 20 years. Emerging evidence suggests that Roux-en-Y gastricbypass (RYGB) induces its metabolic effects by modulating neuronal-hormonal pathways between the gutand energy regulating centers within the brain. We developed a mouse model of RYGB that can recapitulatemost of the human findings and this model can be used to further dissect the underlying mechanism of thissurgery. In this proposal we show that RYGB reverses the disruption caused by high fat diet (HFD) on diurnalfood intake behavior. It causes an increase in the percentage of food intake consumed during the dark cycle(physiologic feeding time) back to that observed in healthy lean animals. RYGB also corrects the HFD-induced alteration in hepatic clock gene oscillation as well as the paraventricular nucleus of thehypothalamus. The improvement in glucose metabolism after RYGB was shown to be primarily due toreduction in hepatic glucose production and amelioration of hepatic insulin sensitivity. The molecular clockmachinery (within the liver and certain areas of the brain) plays a key role in lipid carbohydrate andxenobiotic metabolism in synchrony with the fasting/feeding cycle. Here we show that RYGB induces anattenuated response to weight loss and glucose improvement in clock19 mutant mice (deficient in the Clockgene) compared to wild-type controls. In addition we acquired new data showing that selective forebraindeletion of Bmal1 (another core clock gene) disrupts normal circadian feeding and results in abnormal hepaticglucose production independent of weight. Interestingly selective hepatic vagotomy corrects this metabolicabnormality. This data suggest that the molecular clock play a role in the gluco-regulatory effects of RYGB ina pathway involving the hepatic vagus nerve. Aim#1 will test if the effects of RYGB on glucose homeostasisrequire a functional central (i.e hypothalamic) and peripheral (i.e. hepatic) molecular clock. Aim#2 will test ifRYGB reprograms central clock gene expression to regulate glucose metabolism via a mechanism involvingthe hepatic vagus. Identifying pathways used by RYGB to induce its metabolic benefits will hopefully assist infuture development of less invasive therapies for obesity and type 2 diabetes.","ARNTL gene;Adrenergic Fibers;Affect;American;Animals;Area;Attenuated;Back;Behavior;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Calories;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Circadian Dysregulation;Circadian Rhythms;Consumption;Data;Denervation;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Diurnal Rhythm;Dorsal;Eating;Eating Behavior;Energy Metabolism;Fasting;Feeding behaviors;Fiber;Food;Future;Gastric Bypass;Gene Expression;Genes;Gluconeogenesis;Glucose;Hepatic;High Fat Diet;Hormonal;Human;Hyperglycemia;Hypothalamic structure;Insulin Resistance;Knockout Mice;Leptin;Light;Liver;Measures;Mediating;Medical;Metabolic;Modeling;Motor;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Nerve;Neurons;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obese Mice;Obesity;Obesity Epidemic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Overweight;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Periodicity;Peripheral;Phase;Physiological;Play;Prosencephalon;Regulatory Pathway;Research;Risk Factors;Role;Shift-Work Sleep Disorder;Signal Transduction;Sleep;Sleep Wake Cycle;Sleep disturbances;Structure;Syndrome;Testing;Thinness;Time;Vagotomy;Vagus nerve structure;Veterans;Weight;Work;Xenobiotic Metabolism;bariatric surgery;base;blood glucose regulation;carbohydrate metabolism;circadian;comorbidity;diet-induced obesity;energy balance;feeding;food consumption;glucose metabolism;glucose production;glycogenolysis;high risk;improved;insulin sensitivity;lipid metabolism;molecular clock;mouse model;novel;obesity management;obesity treatment;paraventricular nucleus;response;restoration;shift work;suprachiasmatic nucleus","Regulation of glucose homeostasis via the molecular clock machinery and the hepatic vagus nerve after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass","The spreading of the obesity epidemic did not spare the US veterans and placed them in fact at higher riskfor developing diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

"No NIH Category available","Regulation of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) expression in the kidney is critical to themaintenance of extracellular Na+ and volume homeostasis. This in turn plays an important rolein blood pressure control as illustrated by the observation that ENaC mutations cause inheritedforms of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome) and hypotension (PHA type 1). The overall goal ofour proposal is to elucidate signaling mechanisms and trafficking pathways that regulate ENaC.Building on our work in the previous funding period we will focus on a novel signaling pathwaythat regulates ENaC trafficking under conditions of hyperglycemia. Previous work indicates thatin diabetes mellitus renal Na+ absorption in the distal nephron is enhanced and ENaCabundance is increased. This may serve to counter Na+ and volume wasting induced byhyperglycemia. Moreover there is a critical link between diabetes mellitus and hypertension.Hypertension is two-fold more common in diabetics than in the general population and itdramatically increases the risk for cardiovascular complications. Previous work suggests acausative role for excessive renal Na+ reabsorption in the pathogenesis of diabetes-associatedhypertension. However the underlying mechanisms linking diabetes and hypertension as wellas the mechanisms to explain enhanced ENaC abundance have not been identified. In thisproposal we will address this critical gap in our knowledge. In preliminary studies we found thatENaC current was increased by exposure of collecting duct epithelia to elevated glucoseconcentrations within the range found in patients with diabetes mellitus. Glucose increasedcurrent by increasing ENaC abundance at the cell surface. Additional preliminary data support arole for an E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 in this regulation. Based on these findings we proposean overall hypothesis that hyperglycemia increases renal Na+ absorption by altering Nedd4-2-regulated trafficking of ENaC. We propose three specific aims to test this model.

"No NIH Category available","Alcohol abuse causes many long-lasting health consequences; one of which is impaired cognitivefunctioning known as alcohol-associated dementia (AAD). AAD is caused by the morphologicalneurophysiological and biochemical changes in the brain. The most devastating feature of brain damagefollowing chronic alcohol abuse is neurodegeneration. Alcohol abuse is frequently associated with thedeficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Besides alcohol exposure other factors such as genetic backgroundaging or nutritional status also contribute to thiamine deficiency (TD). The relationship between TD andalcohol-induced neurodegeneration remains unclear. Our studies indicate that TD exacerbated alcohol-inducedneurodegeneration. Alcohol exposure caused significant endoplasmic reticulum ER stress in the brain. Wehypothesize that TD causes a deficiency in unfolded protein response (UPR) which function as a protectiveresponse to alleviate ER stress-induced damage. MANF is an evolutionarily conserved neurotrophic factor andan important UPR component. We further hypothesize that MANF is a key protein that maintains ERhomeostasis and TD-induced deficiency in MANF makes neurons more susceptible to alcohol-induced ERstress and neurodegeneration. In this proposal we will first investigate the effect of TD on MANF expression.We will then determine the role of MANF in alcohol-induced ER stress and neurodegeneration. Finally we willdetermine whether manipulation of MANF expression in the brain can alter TD/alcohol-induced behavioraldeficits. As a unit the proposal will investigate the mechanisms of how TD exacerbates alcohol-inducedneurodegeneration and establish a protective role of MANF in alcohol-induced neurodegeneration.

Specifically the Veterans Health Administration performs about 400000 surgicalprocedures per year and data derived from the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program(VASQIP) indicate that major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) after non-cardiac surgeries occur inapproximately 5% while another study indicates that myocardial injury indicated by asymptomatic post-operative troponin elevation a major risk factor for post-operative mortality occurs in 13.9% of veteransundergoing non-cardiac surgery. On the other hand physical activity is one of the most powerful modifiers of cardiovascular risk withproven benefits both for those with healthy hearts and for those with diseased hearts. Skeletal muscles arecritical for mobility but there is also an emerging understanding that they produce and secrete cytokinestermed myokines which mediate local and systemic changes in order to promote exercise tolerance andoverall health. We recently demonstrated that the myokine musclin is upregulated in response to physicalactivity and augments physical endurance. Our preliminary data also indicate that musclin production drivesthe myocardial energetic adaptation necessary to increase cardiac stress resistance. Based on these findingswe propose that musclin upregulation is critical for exercise-induced cardiac conditioning and that this effectutilizes molecular pathways that once defined may be harnessed for therapeutic benefit. Musclin also known as osteocrin has high homology to the cardiac natriuretic peptides (NP) withcomparable affinity for the clearance receptor NPRC but low affinity for the guanylyl cyclase-coupledreceptors NPRA and NPRB. Through competitive interference for elimination at NPRC musclin increases thelocal concentration of NPs and augments their effect on synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)- a critical intracellular messenger. This project will use unique genetic mouse models and specially developedbioassays to determine the molecular mechanisms by which musclin integrates skeletal muscle andmyocardial adaptive exercise responses to promote the energetic remodeling necessary for enhanced cardiacperformance and stress resistance. Further the proposal will assess the ability of synthetic musclin infusion tomimic some of the benefits triggered by exercise and thereby reduce vulnerability of the heart to injury.Findings from this study are expected to provide a foundation for development of novel cardioprotectivestrategies for high-risk patients such as those for whom exercise is not possible or well-tolerated due toillnesses or injuries and who require stressful surgeries or interventions.","Accounting;Address;Affinity;Animals;Apoptosis;Binding Proteins;Biological Assay;Cardiac;Cardiovascular system;Cessation of life;Complement;Coupled;Cyclic GMP;Data;Development;Disease;Endocrine;Endocrine Glands;Event;Exercise;Exercise Physiology;Exercise Tolerance;Exhibits;Foundations;Future;Genes;Genetic;Guanylate Cyclase;Health;Heart;Heart Arrest;Heart Diseases;Hospitals;Infusion procedures;Injury;Intervention;Mediating;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Muscle;Myocardial;Myocardial Infarction;NPR2 gene;Natriuretic Peptides;OPA1 gene;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptides;Performance;Physical Endurance;Physical activity;Physiological;Postoperative Period;Prevention strategy;Process;Production;Regulation;Reporting;Resistance;Response Elements;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Stress;Supplementation;Surgical complication;Therapeutic;Tissues;Training;Training Support;Troponin;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Up-Regulation;Veterans;Veterans Health Administration;base;cardioprotection;cardiovascular risk factor;comorbidity;conditioning;cytokine;efficacy evaluation;exercise capacity;exercise training;experimental study;heart disease risk;high risk;improved;mortality;mouse model;myocardial injury;novel;novel strategies;perioperative morbidity;perioperative mortality;programs;protective effect;receptor;response;surgical risk;treadmill;treatment strategy","Myokine musclin and exercise induced cardiac conditioning","Heart attacks are a major complication of surgery. Prior exercise reduces this risk but not everyone canexercise enough to obtain this benefit often because of illnesses or injuries. Veterans undergo over 400000non-cardiac surgeries per year at VA hospitals and are among the 27 million people who undergo non-cardiacsurgeries nationally. Major adverse cardiac events are estimated to occur in up to 13.9 % of all non-cardiacsurgeries in veterans. To address this high risk this project will build on the discovery that exercise causesskeletal muscles to produce and secrete the molecule musclin which promotes both future exercise capacityand cardiac resistance to injury.

"No NIH Category available","Immunotherapy-based strategies (i.e. anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (anti-PD1) are highly suitableoptions for VA patients given the more favorable toxicity profile compared to chemotherapy strategies and theremarkable durable tumor responses that can be triggered. However only a minority of patients derive benefitfrom single-agent immunotherapies and improvements are needed before routine use of anti-PD1 agents asfirst-line treatment. Therefore there remains a significant need to identify novel alternative immunotherapeuticstrategies in order to improve survival outcomes for VA HNSCC patients. We propose that interleukin-1 (IL-1)ligands (e.g. IL-1 and/or IL-1) may represent an effective immunotherapy in HNSCC patients. IL-1 signalingcan activate a robust anti-tumor immune response via increased antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs)triggering of natural killer (NK) cell activity and activation/proliferation of CD4+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.This suggests that increasing levels of circulating IL-1 ligands may trigger anti-tumor immunity and enhanceHNSCC tumor response to other therapeutic strategies that can induce anti-tumor responses such asradiotherapy and anti-PD1 therapy. Our preliminary data has shown unprecedented and durable T cell-dependent anti-tumor responses with a single intraperitoneal administration of an IL-1 polyanhydridenanoparticle (IL-1NP) formulation to mice as a single agent. Additionally in comparison to administration ofrecombinant IL-1 which elicited severe weight loss and toxicity IL-1NPs showed no obvious signs of toxicity.Based on this data we believe that IL-1 administration using nanoparticle delivery may represent a promisingimmunotherapeutic approach AND adjuvant to other agents approved for the treatment of HNSCC that triggeranti-tumor immune responses (e.g. radiotherapy and anti-PD1). We hypothesize that IL-1NPs will trigger ananti-tumor immune response and enhance HNSCC tumor response to radiotherapy and anti-PD1 therapy. Aim1 will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety profile of IL-1NPs; Aim 2 will examine if IL-1NPs will enhanceHNSCC tumor response to radiotherapy; and Aim 3 will examine if IL-1NPs will enhance HNSCC tumorresponse to anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

"No NIH Category available","Insulin resistance and uncontrolled diabetes are very common among Veterans and lead to decreasedmuscle strength contributing to impaired recovery from illness and other disease-related morbidity. Indeedpatients with diabetes recover strength slower after major surgery than non-diabetic patients. These changesare associated with decreased muscle mitochondrial energy production but the signals that controlmitochondrial metabolism in muscle during diabetes remain incompletely understood. We recently showedthat insulin receptors (IR) and IGF-1 receptors (IGF1R) display overlapping roles in the control of muscleprotein turnover through cellular autophagy or self-eating to maintain muscle mass and that this control isdependent on FoxO transcription factors. Furthermore our preliminary studies show that knockout ofIR/IGF1R both chronically and acutely lead to mitochondrial abnormalities that can be prevented by deletion ofFoxOs in muscle. The goal of this proposal is to investigate whether FoxO proteins control musclemitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial-specific autophagy or mitophagy in the context of decreased IRand IGF1R signaling. To accomplish the goals of this project we propose 2 aims: Aim 1 will quantify mitophagyusing mitoTIMER/LAMP1-YFP and Parkin-YFP mitophagy biosensors in muscle from muscle-specific inducibleIR knockout both IR/IGF1R knockout or IR/IGF1R with FoxO1/3/4 quintuple knockout mice in concert withmeasurements of mitochondrial bioenergetics; Aim 2 will determine the regulation of transcriptional andprotein homeostatic mechanisms by which loss of IR/IGF1R and/or FoxOs signaling in muscle leads toimpairment of mitochondrial Complex I.

The major aim of this proposal is to modulatecerebello-thalamic circuits to treat migraine and PTH. Headache reduces quality of life and can coincide withdisabling sensory abnormalities including photophobia and pain. Migraine alone is estimated to affect 18% ofwomen and 6% of men (12% overall). However this prevalence is even greater in Veterans (50% overall) whohave served in Iraq and Afghanistan and have experienced TBI and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. To datenearly half of patients who have either migraine or PTH receive no beneficial outcomes with currenttreatments.This proposal will test the hypothesis that inhibition of cerebello-thalamic circuits can be used to treat migraine-like behaviors in mice. In the first aim the plan is to inhibit the posterior thalamic area and the fastigial nucleusof the cerebellum to treat mice that are in a headache-like state. To model headache we will use calcitoningene-related peptide (CGRP) (a neuropeptide that is necessary and sufficient to induce migraine) and a TBImodel involving mild closed head impact. We will test mice in three translatable behavior paradigms thatmeasure light aversion touch hypersensitivity and grimace. We will modulate the posterior thalamic area andfastigial nuclei of the cerebellum using a chemogenetic strategy with an inhibitory ligand-activated designerreceptor. Our preliminary data indicate that stimulation of those two brain regions is sufficient to inducemigraine-like behaviors in mice. Successful completion of this aim will provide translatable targets for directbrain modulation to treat headache disorders. In the second aim of this proposal we will use blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI) to identify downstream targets of theposterior thalamic area and cerebellum during a migraine-like or post-traumatic headache-like state. We willperform imaging in mice after they are given CGRP pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide(PACAP) (a peptide that is also reported to cause migraine in patients) or mild TBI. We will alsooptogenetically stimulate the posterior thalamic area and cerebellum fastigial nucleus to map functionalconnectivity changes of downstream targets in the brain. The goal is to identify additional brain targets that aremore accessible for modulation.The significance of this study is the potential translation of these pre-clinical studies to the clinic.

"No NIH Category available","The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic and risk is especially high in veterans. Currenttherapies consist mainly of alternative opioids but their efficacy is limited. Thus new treatments for pain andaddiction are in high demand. Improved knowledge of the mechanisms underlying opioid addiction and relapsecould help predict who might be a risk for addiction and help to develop better therapies for those alreadybattling addiction and relapse. The reinforcing effects of opioids depend in large part on the nucleusaccumbens (NAc) and mu opioid receptors which are expressed at glutamatergic synapses on medium spinyneurons in the NAc. Opioids and other drugs of abuse can hijack these synapses and alter their numbermorphology and glutamate receptor subunit composition. These changes are thought to produce abnormalsynaptic states that underlie addiction withdrawal craving and relapse. We recently identified a novelsignaling mechanism that can influence the synaptic and behavioral effects of opiate drugs. This mechanisminvolves protons released from presynaptic neurotransmitter-containing vesicles activation of the post-synapticacid sensing ion channel ASIC1A and pH buffering at the synapse by carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4). Ourprevious studies and pilot data suggest that ASIC1A plays a critical role in stabilizing glutamatergic synapsesin the NAc and that loss of ASIC1A increases vulnerability to synaptic abnormalities induced by opioids aswell as by cocaine. Interestingly reducing pH buffering by disrupting CA4 increases the inward synaptic Na+currents mediated by ASIC1A and appears to protect against the synaptic rearrangements thought tocontribute to addiction craving and relapse. Here we propose to extensively test the degree to which CA4 andASIC1A regulate opioid-induced synaptic abnormalities in the NAc and influence opioid-reinforced behaviors.Specific Aim 1 proposes to test the effects of opioids on synaptic physiology in mice lacking ASIC1A CA4 orboth. Specific Aim 2 proposes to test effects of opioids in these mice in multiple behavioral paradigmsincluding opioid self-administration withdrawal and relapse-related behaviors. We hypothesize thatdisrupting ASIC1A will alter synaptic and behavioral effects of opioids disrupting CA4 will protect against theseeffects and that effects of CA4 disruption will depend on ASIC1A. Together the experiments in this proposalwill pave the way to a better understanding of the neurobiology underlying opioid addiction. Moreover theknowledge gained from these studies could suggest new ways to treat opioid addiction through non-opioidergicpathways for example by manipulating brain pH ASICs or carbonic anhydrase for which several inhibitorsare already approved for human use.","AMPA Receptors;ASIC channel;Acids;Acute;Address;Affect;Ambulatory Care Facilities;American;Analgesics;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Paradigm;Brain;Buffers;Carbonic Anhydrase IV;Cations;Chronic;Cocaine;Data;Dendritic Spines;Enzymes;Functional disorder;Glutamate Receptor;Glutamates;Goals;Healthcare;Human;Knowledge;Lead;Measures;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Target;Morphine;Morphology;Mus;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;Neurobiology;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Nucleus Accumbens;Opiate Addiction;Opioid;Pain;Pain management;Pathway interactions;Patients;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Physiology;Pilot Projects;Play;Protons;Rattus;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;Risk;Role;Self Administration;Signal Transduction;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic Cleft;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;United States;Vesicle;Veterans;Wild Type Mouse;Withdrawal;addiction;carbonate dehydratase;cocaine self-administration;conditioned place preference;craving;density;drug of abuse;expectation;experimental study;extracellular;illicit opioid;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;mu opioid receptors;non-opioid analgesic;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;opioid epidemic;opioid overdose;opioid use disorder;opioid withdrawal;overdose death;overexpression;prescription opioid;presynaptic;prevent;receptor function;reinforced behavior;response;statistics","Investigating a novel regulatory pathway for opioid-induced synaptic plasticity and behavior","In 2016 64000 Americans died from accidental overdose of opioid drugs.

Checkpoint blockade with antibodies against PD-1 PD-L1 and CTLA-4 results inpartial and complete responses in patients with a variety of malignancies. Yet significant limitations exist. Withthe exception of patients with melanoma only a minority of patients respond to checkpoint blockage. Commoncancers such as prostate and colorectal cancer generally do not respond. Thus additional approaches areneeded to realize the full potential of cancer immunotherapy. Treatment with  T cells expressing V2V2 TCRs is one such approach. Unlike  T cells the responseof V2V2 T cells is not MHC restricted but instead requires the Ig superfamily protein butyrophilin 3A1 tosense the foreign-microbial isoprenoid metabolite HMBPP and the self-metabolite IPP. This sensing allowstumor cells to be recognized and killed by V2V2 T cells independent of their mutational burden. V2V2 Tcells safely expand to very high numbers during many infections (up to 1 in 2 circulating T cells) where they killinfected cells and secrete inflammatory Th1 cytokines chemokines and growth factors. Two approaches are being used to treat cancer with V2V2 T cells. The first is to immunize with stimula-tors such as the bromohydrin analog of HMBPP or the aminobisphosphonate zoledronic acid with low-dose IL-2. Although treatment has resulted in partial remissions these vaccines eventually cause anergy and deletionof the V2V2 T cells. The second is to adoptively transfer V2V2 T cells. This approach is safe and has in-duced complete remissions in three patients with solid tumors and induced partial remissions or stable dis-ease in others. However for widespread adoption V2V2 T cell therapy needs to be more effective. Live bacterial vaccines have been used to prevent tuberculosis typhoid fever and tularemia. The bacteriaproduce compounds that activate innate immunity and antigens that stimulate  T cells to provide help to theV2V2 T cells as they expand. We have now identified an attenuated Listeria strain that consistently ex-pands V2V2 T cells. Listeria preferentially accumulate in tumors which should allow the specific tar-geting of adoptively-transferred V2V2 T cells to tumors as well as TCR stimulation at the tumor siteby HMBPP. We also find that V2V2 T cells rapidly express checkpoint receptors such as CTLA-4 PD-1 TIM-3 and LAG-3 upon stimulation and that adding PD-1 checkpoint blockade markedly enhancesprostate tumor immunity by V2V2 T cells in a mouse model. We have also identified a novelbisphosphonate prodrug. To accomplish these goals we will: delete inlB in actA prfA* (G155S) Listeriavaccine and assess dosing and timing of immunization assess the ability of Listeria bacteria to target and acti-vate adoptively transferred V2V2 T cells to control tumors and assess effectiveness of combining checkpointblockade and a new PTA bisphosphonate prodrug with adoptively transferred V2V2 T cells. We have an outstanding team with an excellent track record and have extensive experience working with T cells and isoprenoid metabolism. We have established in vivo models and techniques. An effective Liste-ria vaccine have been identified. The molecular methods to create more vaccines are well developed. In con-clusion immunotherapy using bacterial vaccines for V2V2 T cells has the potential to be broadly applicablefor the treatment of many different tumors both by direct activation and through potentiating adoptive transfer.","Adoption;Adoptive Immunotherapy;Adoptive Transfer;Anabolism;Antibodies;Antigens;Attenuated;B lymphoid malignancy;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Bacterial Vaccines;Bladder;Blood Cells;CAR T cell therapy;CTLA4 gene;Cancer Etiology;Cells;Cessation of life;Colon Carcinoma;Colorectal;Colorectal Cancer;Developed Countries;Developing Countries;Diphosphates;Disease remission;Dose;Effectiveness;Environmental Hazards;Exposure to;Goals;Growth Factor;Gulf War;Human;Immunity;Immunization;Immunize;Immunodeficient Mouse;Immunoglobulins;Immunotherapy;In complete remission;Incidence;Infection;Inflammatory;Interleukin-2;Kidney;Koreans;Listeria;Listeria monocytogenes;Lung;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Metabolism;Methods;Microbe;Military Personnel;Minority;Molecular;Monitor;Monkeys;Mutation;Natural Immunity;Partial Remission;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern recognition receptor;Persian Gulf;Play;Primates;Prodrugs;Prostatic Neoplasms;Proteins;Protozoan Infections;Renal carcinoma;Risk;Role;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Stable Disease;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Lymphocyte;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Tuberculosis;Tularemia;Tumor Immunity;Typhoid Fever;United States;Vaccines;Veterans;Vietnam;World War II;Zoledronic Acid;analog;anergy;bisphosphonate;butyrophilin;cancer immunotherapy;cancer type;cell killing;checkpoint receptors;chemokine;chimeric antigen receptor;cytokine;effectiveness evaluation;experience;high risk;immune checkpoint blockade;improved;in vivo Model;inorganic phosphate;intravenous injection;isopentenyl pyrophosphate;isoprenoid;malignant breast neoplasm;melanoma;metabolic engineering;mevalonate;microbial;mortality;mouse model;neoantigens;neoplastic cell;novel;pamidronate;partial response;prenyl;prevent;programmed cell death ligand 1;programmed cell death protein 1;tumor; T cells","Metabolic Engineering of Bacteria for Cancer Immunotherapy by Gamma Delta T Cells","Many studies have found higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality amongveterans.

"No NIH Category available","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects over half of all Veterans and threatens the lives of those withimpaired immune systems. Even among Veterans with normal immune systems the insidious reactivationof the virus taxes the immune system incites low-level inflammation and possibly accelerates aging andshortens lifespan. HCMV is the most common infectious cause of birth defects. There is no HCMV vaccineand the antiviral drugs have problems with potency toxicity and drug-resistance. The long-range goal ofthis research is to identify critical pivot points in the viral transcription-DNA replication cycle that arevulnerable new targets for therapeutic intervention. This proposal is based on the premise that our gap inknowledge of how viral early transcription begets viral DNA replication and viral DNA replication begets virallate transcription limits our ability to design therapeutic treatments for the viral disease. We have developedmodified PRO-Seq and PRO-Cap methods to determine exactly where on the viral genome that Pol II andits attached nascent transcript is located and at what frequency the engaged Pol II is at that nucleotideposition during the infection. This allows us to precisely determine where transcription is initiating the extentof promoter-proximal Pol II pausing and the degree to which productive transcription elongation is takingplace. We designed bioinformatics algorithms to analyze this data. Our preliminary studies show that HCMVutilizes host Pol II elongation control in early and late infection but HCMV evolved different strategies inpromoting the viral transcription and linking it to viral DNA replication. Frequently used viral promoters moreoften contain upstream TATA elements than do host promoters and viral initiator elements differ from that ofthe host in nucleotide preference. In late infection HCMV and not the host uses TATT as a Pol II positioningelement which presumably requires the actions of viral late transcription factors (LTFs). We also find thatnearly 20% of paused Pol II is found in the non-coding long RNA4.9 gene at a location in the viral lytic originof replication (oriLyt) that is essential for oriLyt function; robust enhancer transcription underlies the worldrenown viral major immediate-early promoter; and viral transcription is pervasive and exhibits a patternpredictive of that arising from an unchromatinzed DNA template. Our research plan is designed to furthervalidate establish meaning of and mechanistically understand these findings. To advance these objectiveswe have adapted a newly developed approach to specifically and rapidly deplete viral proteins putativelyinvolved in viral transcription. As proof of concept we observe changes in levels of multiple viral RNAs aftereliminating all the viral IE2 protein isoforms in late infection over a 6-hr timeframe suggesting that theactions of one or more of these viral protein isoforms may have an overarching effect on viral transcription.We will combine this technique with PRO-Seq and PRO-Cap to determine the roles of the IE2 isoforms andthe UL79 LTF (a putative late viral transcription elongation factor) in viral late transcription. In doing thesestudies we will test the hypothesis that HCMV usurps Pol II initiation and elongation control to direct viralDNA replication coordinate the viruss gene expression program in lytic and latent-like infections andcontend with the threat of chromatin invasion. Our studies have been specifically designed to determine therole of transcription and structural elements in the function of the HCMV replication origin (Aim 1); determinethe core DNA elements and viral factors required in late viral transcription (Aim 2); and determine howtranscription differs in a quiescent infection and responds to activation (Aim 3). This proposal integrates thepertinent and extensive expertise of the Meier and the Price labs in virology and transcription respectively.This research could not be done by either lab alone. The Meier and Price labs have a strong foundation ofproductive collaboration on which to build and complete this research plan.","Address;Aging;Algorithm Design;Algorithms;Antiviral Agents;Biochemical Genetics;Bioinformatics;Biological;Cell model;Chromatin;Collaborations;Congenital Abnormality;Cost Savings;Cytomegalovirus;Cytomegalovirus Infections;Cytomegalovirus Vaccines;DNA;DNA Polymerase II;DNA biosynthesis;Data;Disease;Drug resistance;Early Promoters;Elements;Enhancers;Exhibits;Foundations;Frequencies;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Human;Immune system;Impairment;Infection;Infection prevention;Inflammation;Institute of Medicine (U.S.);Knowledge;Life;Link;Location;Longevity;Lytic;Methods;Modeling;Mutation;Nucleotides;Outcome Study;Pattern;Pharmacology;Positioning Attribute;Price;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Replication Origin;Research;Research Design;Role;Site;Structure;Taxes;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Toxic effect;Transcript;Transcription Elongation;Transcriptional Elongation Factors;Untranslated RNA;Veterans;Viral;Viral Drug Resistance;Viral Genome;Viral Proteins;Virus;Virus Diseases;base;cell type;design;genetic approach;human disease;human model;insight;mortality risk;new therapeutic target;preference;prevent;programs;promoter;transcription factor;viral DNA;viral RNA;virology","Mechanisms regulating cytomegalovirus","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection takes a toll on the life and health of thousands of Veterans becausethe currently available antiviral drugs are woefully inadequate.

Thousands ofVeterans already have CMV within them that has re-activated from dormancy to produce disease.This motivates a search for alternative ways of blocking CMV infection. Our research goal is todeactivate CMV before it starts replicating. By studying how CMV activates its gene expressionprogram for replication we aim to identify vital targets susceptible to precision-guided neutralizationby pharmacologic agents.

"No NIH Category available","Chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) is a worldwide health problem that can lead to cirrhosis endstage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the HCV epidemic theincidence of HCC is rising at an alarming rate and US veterans with cirrhosis have 5-8% lifetimerisk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). New highly effective antiviral therapies forHCV have recently become available but these have had little impact on development of HCCand it is virtually unknown how the virus causes cancer. Our group has been studying theeffects of HCV on the host cellular enzyme telomerase which is a reverse transcriptase (RT)that repairs short chromosomal DNA 3' telomeric ends in dividing cells. Adequate telomerelengths must be maintained to avoid chromosomal injury and to support continuous cellularreplication. Consequently telomerase is induced or upregulated in the majority of malignantcells and has proven to be a valuable cellular target enzyme for cancer detection and anticancertherapy.Our laboratory has recently shown that HCV induces telomerase early after infection and wehypothesize that this behavior contributes to the virus' oncogenicity. Induction of telomerase islikely facilitated in part through the actions of HCV proteins core NS5A and NS3-4A in the hosthepatocyte. We have also demonstrated that HCV core and NS5A proteins transcriptionallyactivate TERT promoter and that NS3-4A the viral protease-helicase complex bindsspecifically to TERT and stimulates telomerase catalytic activity. Our data are the first to showthat HCV can induce TERT expression as well as catalytically activate host telomerase. Theoverlying hypothesis of this application is that HCV reactivates telomerase through initialinteractions with the Wnt/-catenin signaling system which then drives TERT promoter to opentranscription. This is likely accomplished by core and NS5A which have been shown to stabilizeactivated Wnt/-catenin signaling complexes. We also hypothesize that NS3-4A amultifunctional protease-helicase increases telomerase catalytic activity by optimizing theenzyme's type II processivity. By increasing telomerase processivity NS3-4A thus promotesefficiency of telomere repair and facilitates neoplastic progression. Collectively the actions ofthe virus upregulate chromosomal maintenance and repair mechanisms and promotehepatocarcinogenesis. The long term goals of our work are two-fold: we wish to determine themechanisms of how the virus induces telomerase expression and increases telomerasecatalytic activity. Achievement of both of these goals will lead to the identification of cellularevents that are undoubtedly important for HCC development and ultimately treatment. Thisapproach is highly relevant for understanding how HCV promotes liver cancer and the data willlay a firm foundation for eventual drug targeting of telomerase or the viral helicase withanticancer agents.","Achievement;Antineoplastic Agents;Antiviral Agents;Antiviral Therapy;Behavior;Binding;Biopsy Specimen;Cancer Detection;Cancer Etiology;Cells;Chronic Hepatitis C;Cirrhosis;Complex;Core Protein;DNA;Data;Development;Drug Targeting;Enzymes;Epidemic;Event;Foundations;Future;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Grant;Health;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C Therapy;Hepatitis C virus;Hepatocarcinogenesis;Hepatocyte;Holoenzymes;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;Infection;Injury;Laboratories;Lead;Length;Liver;Liver diseases;Maintenance;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of liver;Mus;Neoplasms;Nuclear;Oncogenic Viruses;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Primary carcinoma of the liver cells;Proteins;RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;Signal Transduction;Structure;System;Telomerase;Transcriptional Activation;Transcriptional Regulation;Veterans;Viral;Viral Core Proteins;Virus;WNT Signaling Pathway;Work;beta catenin;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cellular targeting;experimental study;helicase;humanized mouse;in vivo;lifetime risk;mouse model;neoplastic;prevent;promoter;repair function;repaired;telomere;tumor progression;virtual","Neoplastic interactions of hepatitis C virus with telomerase.","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis and cause of liver cancer in USveterans and around the world.

"No NIH Category available","The Leishmania spp. protozoa cause a group of diseases that are common in the many endemiccountries worldwide. These include Afghanistan and Iraq countries where recent outbreaks ofleishmaniasis have initiated among US military personnel. The most common clinical forms ofleishmaniasis and the most common causes of these outbreaks are cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL)due to Leishmania major and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by L. infantum or L. donovani. Leishmania are obligate intracellular parasites in mammals. Most parasites reside inmacrophages where they replicate and survive long-term. Recent data show that neutrophils are thefirst host cells to infiltrate and internalize parasites in the skin after the bite of an infected sand fly. Thepassage of Leishmania through neutrophils before they are internalized by other phagocytes hasbeen cited as a means of paralyzing the microbicidal and antigen presenting functions ofmacrophages and dendritic cells early in infection. During studies of human leishmaniasis we weresurprised to find a subset of neutrophils expressing class II MHC antigens and other markers ofantigen presenting cells (APCs) in chronic infection. MHCII+ PMNs also expressed PD-L1 a T cellexhaustion receptor ligand leading us to question a potential role in adaptive immunity. A further roleof neutrophils was implied by studies of mice lacking NLRP10 which developed prolonged severecutaneous lesions but no change in their parasite load suggesting that NLRP10 is critical forresolution of a neutrophilic infiltrate that contributes to the manifestations of disease. Theseobservations led us to hypothesize that neutrophils contribute toward exacerbating or prolongingsymptomatic leishmaniasis in a manner independent of leishmanicidal activity. We propose topursue these hypotheses by examining the following three aims.Aim 1: The extent of neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil phenotypes at the sites ofinflammation during murine leishmaniasis. Hypothesis: Unusual subsets of neutrophils arerecruited to the site of Leishmania spp. infection acutely and through chronic phases of infection.Aim 2: The development and functions of neutrophil subsets in Leishmania spp. infection.Hypothesis: The dysfunctional immune responses observed in leishmaniasis leading the host type 1immune response astray from eradicating the parasite and curing disease is amplified in part bysubsets of neutrophils expressing markers of APCs and/or T cell exhaustion partners.Aim 3.

"No NIH Category available","Destructive parenchymal lung diseases such as emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis are largely irreversibleand strategies for eliciting alveolar repair and regeneration are an important priority. This applicationaddresses mechanisms which guide alveolar fibroblasts to optimal locations for generation of a coherentmechanically integrated elastic and collagen fiber network. Learning how signaling platforms integrate andcondition signals from the extracellular environment during alveolar development is critical for modifying howfibroblasts migrate and transition to myofibroblasts (MF). When their neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) was depletedpulmonary MF did not diminish but the surrounding alveolar ducts were enlarged. Preliminary studies alsoshowed that collagen enhanced Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate-1 (Rac1) activation which isrequired for cell polarization and migration. Hypothesis: Nrp1 and discoidin domain receptor-2 (DDR2) modifyPDGFR-mediated signaling through Rac1 to direct lung fibroblast (LF) migration and extracellular matrix(ECM) remodeling during alveolar septation. Components of these signaling pathways assemble inmembrane lipid rafts (MLR) where integrins link the ECM to the cellular actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions.In Aim 1 MF from the lungs of mice bearing deletions of PDGFR or Nrp1 will be used to dissect the signalingpathways which transmit information from collagen 1-integrins and DDR2 to activate Rac1 and therebyregulate the formation of lamellipodia. These studies will (a) examine how Nrp1-deletion alters PDGFR-targeted protein kinases adapter proteins and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (b) evaluate how PDGF-Ainteracts with Nrp1 and (c) how Nrp1 regulates endosomal trafficking of PDGFR. Aim 2 will examine defectsin collagen fibers of PDGFR Nrp1 or DDR2-deleted mice and how these defects impact the positioning ofMF and collagen fibers. These studies will show how DDR2 and integrin 21 determine the way fibroblastsrespond to fibrillar collagen-1 including their polarization of lamellipodia and membrane type-1 matrixmetalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) during migration. They will also determine how the rigidity of collagen fibersalters Rac1-activation focal adhesion formation and cell migration. Aim 3 will investigate how PDGFR andNrp1 interact with DDR2 and via Rac1 assemble podosomes where membrane type-1 matrixmetalloprotease (MT1-MMP) targets collagen fibers for degradation to direct the migration and positioning ofMF. These studies will explore how podosomes and Rac1 enable fibroblasts to probe and remodel collagenfibers along the axis extending into the distal alveolar septum. In all three aims the collagen composition andthe rigidity of the cellular environment will be manipulated to define how they influence cell polarity (oflamellipodia and podosomes) Rac1 activation migration towards stiffer substrates (durotaxis) and theremodeling of collagen fibers. Learning how MLR and their protein constituents integrate and condition signalsfrom the extracellular environment is critical to modifying how fibroblasts migrate and transition to MF. Thisprocess is fundamental to understanding these diseases and how they may be remediated through alveolarregeneration.
