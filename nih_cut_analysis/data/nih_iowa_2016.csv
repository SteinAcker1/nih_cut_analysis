"No NIH Category available","Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality for people with compromisedimmunity. Unfortunately the mortality associated with invasive fungal infections remains unacceptably high.One of the contributing factors to this poor outcome is the fact that there are relatively few therapeutic optionsfor the treatment of invasive fungal infections particularly when compared to the number of antibioticsavailable for the treatment of bacterial infections. To identify new antifungal drug candidates we have initiateda high throughput screening and chemical biology-based project to identify molecules that interfere with fungalcell wall biosynthesis. Application of this strategy has rapidly led to the identification of humanphosphoinositide dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) inhibitors as highly active antifungal molecules in vitro. PDK1inhibitors have been extensively developed as targeted anticancer molecules because of their low toxicitytoward normal cells. Encouragingly two of the PDK1 inhibitors identified in our preliminary work (UCN-01 andOSU-03012) have been or are being evaluated in human clinical trials. In order to develop the promisingpotential of PDK1/Pkh inhibitors as antifungal drugs we will: characterize the molecular basis for the activity ofmammalian PDK1 inhibitors toward fungal PDK1 orthologs (Aim 1); characterize the function of PDK1orthologs in the human fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (Aim 2); determinein vivo efficacy of PDK1 inhibitors in animal models (Aim 3); and optimize antifungal properties of PDK1inhibitors and identify antifungal PDK1 inhibitors with novel chemical scaffolds (Aim 4). Successful executionof these aims is expected to not only provide a fundamental chemical and biological foundation for thedevelopment of antifungal PDK1 molecules but could also lead to the rapid translation of PDK1 inhibitors toclinical use since two of our lead compounds have already been evaluated in human clinical trials."," ","Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 as an antifungal drug target","Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality for people with compromisedimmunity.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephronophthisis (NPHP) one of the most frequent genetic causes of chronic renal failure in the first three decades of life is a group of autosomalrecessive diseases characterized by progressive kidney cystic degeneration and fibrosis. Mutations in the gene GLIS2/NPHP7 are the cause of nephronophthisis type 7 both in humans and mice. GLIS2 is a transcription factor with high sequence homology to GLI1 GLI2 and GLI3 the vertebrate orthologs of Drosophila Ci (cubitus interruptus). Like Drosophila Ci GLI proteins are key molecules in the vertebrate Hedgehog (Hh) signaling a pathway highly conserved in the evolution and central in the regulation of proliferation differentiation and repair during embryonc and postnatal life. We have recently tested and confirmed the hypothesis that Glis2 is a repressor of Hh signaling in the postnatal kidney and demonstrated that malfunctioning of this pathway results in kidney cysts and fibrosis increased inflammatory infiltration and apoptosis but the molecular events leading to this kidney phenotype are still unexplained. Preliminary studies performed in my laboratory have unexpectedly revealed that loss of Glis2 results in over expression of Toll like receptor 2 (Tlr2) and other components of the pro-inflammatory TLR/NF-B pathway in kidney epithelial cells and in the Tlr2-dependent activation of this pathway. We have also found that expression of several miRNAs in kidney epithelial cells is controlled by Glis2 suggesting that microRNAs are effectors of Glis2/Hh signaling in mouse kidneys. We propose to test in vivo the effect of the inhibition of TLR-2/NF-B signaling on the inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis in Glis2mut/mut mice kidneys by generating Tlr2-/-;Glis2mut/mut and Myd88flox/flox;Glis2mut/mut;KspCre double mutants and establishing Tlr2-/-;Glis2mut/mut bone marrow chimeras. In addition we propose to systematically identify at genome wide level the canonical and non-canonical Glis2 target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation-highly parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and high-throughput microRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq). In light of our most recent results identifying downstream effectors that are deregulated in Glis2 knockout kidneys has gained even more importance and is likely to produce further insights in the complex regulatory network that is altered in our model of cystic kidney diseases and fibrosis."," ","Role of GLIS2 in the Development of Cystic Kidney Disease","Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an inherited disease causing cystic and fibrotic degeneration of the kidneys and is one of the most frequent genetic causes of chronic renal failure in the first three decades of life.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARYPlasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Malaria affected more than200 million people last year killing nearly 600000. Antibody responses that target the parasite are essential forcontrolling parasite replication and limiting the severity of malaria. Potent antibody responses and optimallystimulated B cells require `help' from CD4+ T cells. Our published work has shown that CD4+ T cell function ismarkedly impaired following Plasmodium infection. We linked the reduced function of CD4+ T cells to theinduction of co-inhibitory receptor expression a class of T cell surface expressed proteins that directly limit theability of CD4+ T cells to orchestrate protective immune responses against microbial pathogens. We furthershowed that blocking the activity of co-inhibitory receptors during malaria restored CD4+ T cell functionpromoted strong antibody responses and accelerated parasite control and clearance from the infected host. Recently we identified that we can also restore the function of Plasmodium-specific CD4+ T cells byactivating OX40 a member of a class of T cell stimulating receptors. Our new data show that therapeuticallystimulating the OX40 receptor during the second week of experimental Plasmodium infection overcomes co-inhibitory networks markedly improves CD4+ T cell activity and secreted antibody responses and limitsmalaria parasite replication. Importantly we also identified parallels in children infected with P. falciparumestablishing the relevance and significance of our discoveries and strengthening the scientific premise of thecurrent proposal. In this project we apply new cellular genetic and parasitological reagents to study how theOX40 receptor regulates communication between parasite specific CD4+ T cells and B cells and thegeneration of antibody responses. Our scientific questions and experimental approaches facilitate our long-term goal to identify new immune-based approaches to therapeutically stimulate host resistance againstmalaria. Our goal is addressed by three specific aims that will determine: 1) the distinct characteristics ofPlasmodium infection that uniquely regulate the functional expression of OX40 receptors on CD4+ T cells; 2)whether the OX40 receptor is required for effective communication between CD4+ T cells and B cells togenerate potent antibody responses; and 3) whether B cell expression of the OX40 ligand is regulated byparasite byproducts and necessary for generating potent secreted antibody responses. Our proposed studiesand new reagents provide tractable systems and a detailed framework for sustainable extensions of thisproject that will establish additional new paradigms for enhancing CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity againstPlasmodium.

"No NIH Category available","Plasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Plasmodium parasitesreplicate within and cause the destruction of host red blood cells which triggers inflammation and causes thesymptoms of malarial disease. Parasite-specific antibody responses that develop following infection are criticalfor controlling parasite burden and limiting disease severity. CD4+ helper T cells are essential for coordinatingthese protective antibody responses. However sterilizing anti-Plasmodium immunity rarely develops evenfollowing repeated infection. We hypothesize this is due to deficient Plasmodium-specific effector and memoryCD4+ T cell formation. One of the most critical challenges to developing new immune-based therapies orvaccines against Plasmodium is understanding how or whether long-lived Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+T cells develop function and persist following infection. In this project we have developed powerful newcellular genetic and biochemical approaches that enable direct high-resolution analyses of bona fidePlasmodium-specific memory CD4+ T cells.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The t(4;14) chromosomal translocation found in 20% of multiple myeloma (MM) cases leads to a shorter survival rate in an already incurable disease. The candidate oncogene overexpressed from the t(4;14) translocation WHSC1 (MMSET) is unable to transform cells in culture or drive tumorigenesis in mice on its own. Examination of a 2 MB region around the t(4;14) breakpoint revealed the overexpression of a 125 bp orphan H/ACA class non-coding RNA ACA11 which was confirmed to be up-regulated in t(4;14) MM cell lines and patient samples. Further preliminary studies demonstrate ACA11 localizes to the nucleolus as part of an small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) complex. In addition ACA11 overexpression reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to oxidative stress and increases cell survival in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents. We hypothesize that the overexpression of ACA11 in t(4;14) MM reduces ROS-induced cell death leading to the development and/or progression of MM. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which ACA11 exerts its inhibitory effects on ROS-induced cell cycle inhibition and cell death in t(4;14) MM cell lines. We hypothesize that the overexpression of the ACA11 snoRNA in t(4;14) MM results in the altered splicing of specific RNA transcripts involved in the cellular response to ROS. These selected transcripts will encode either RNA or proteins critical for B-cell survival in MM. Therefore ACA11 and its associated snRNP's will be potential novel targets for MM treatment or diagnosis. Three specific aims of the grant are proposed: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that ACA11 must interact with snRNPs to exert its inhibition of oxidative stress induced cell death Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that ACA11 regulates ROS levels through modulating splicing of  snoRNAs from ribosomal protein transcripts Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that overexpression of ACA11 leads to an inhibition of nucleolar  stress-induced p53-regulated ROS production"," ","ROLE OF ACA11 AN ORPHAN SMALL NUCLEOLAR RNA IN RESISTANCE TO CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of antibody-secreting plasma B-cells and those patients with a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation (20% of all cases) have a shorter survival.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The onset of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery continues to be the most common and costly post-operative complication. Despite rigorous investigation of POAF by physicians and scientists significant gaps remain in our understanding as to why it occurs and specifically why it only occurs in certain patients. Ourlaboratory has obtained exciting preliminary data showing that high activity of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) a mitochondrial outer membrane-bound enzyme and substantial generator of H2O2 in atrial myocardium is strongly correlated with POAF independent of other known risk factors. So are to a lesser extent glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) both critical for maintaining intracellular redox balance. These enzymes were all measured in discarded right atrial appendage (RAA) obtained during cardiac surgery. From a mechanistic perspective these findings are compelling and scientifically plausible because they integrate catecholamine overload mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance in the atrial myocardium all factors in the peri-operative period that are known to contribute to arrhythmogenesis. In the current proposal by obtaining tissue and performing analyses using a much larger cohort of cardiac surgery patients we will build on this highly promising data in order to establish a statistical model of POAF risk based on MAO as a predictive biomarker and to elucidate mechanisms connecting elevated MAO activity in right atrium to POAF by focusing specifically on mitochondrial energetics in the atrial cardiomyocytes. In Aim 1 we will validate MAO as a predictive biomarker of POAF alone or in combination with other redox enzymes by obtaining the RAA tissue intra-operatively from a large cohort (N=770) of adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery and immediately measuring activity of these enzymes. As an exploratory component of this Aim we will examine if MAO and/or GPx in platelets and RBC's respectively obtained pre- operatively from this same cohort of patients can alternatively be used as predictive biomarkers of POAF. In Aim 2 using a much smaller subset of the patient cohort recruited for Aim 1 we will begin to dissect mechanisms by which high MAO activity in atrium leads to POAF by focusing on the interaction between MAO and mitochondrial function in atrial myocardium. Thus these studies will have both a practical applied research component (Aim 1) as well as a basic research component (Aim 2). It is anticipated that the findings from the first Aim will have immediate and sustained clinical impact because they will provide clinicians the ability to predict with high probability which patients are predisposed and therefor at high risk to develop POAF. This would create a pathway to specifically target the 'high-risk' patients with prophylactic anti- arrhythmic medication in the near future. We expect the findings from our basic research on interactions between cardiac MAO and mitochondrial energetics to enhance our understanding of mechanisms connecting high levels of MAO activity in right atrium to POAF."," ","Myocardial redox status catecholamine metabolism and post-operative arrhythmia","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) is the most common and costly complication after open heart surgery. It typically occurs within the first 5 post-operativedays increasing the patient's risk of stroke and infection lengthening the hospital stay and greatly increasing overall costs to the health care system. This project is directed towards validating a biochemical marker which could identify patients who are at high risk of developing this complication so that clinicians would be able to aggressively treat these high-risk patients with certain drugs in order to prevent this complication from happening. Other studies directed at understanding how this complication develops in the first place will also be performed.","NHLBI","9392268","3/15/2017","PA-16-285","7R01HL122863-04","7","R01","HL","122863","04","","SCHWARTZ, LISA ","12/1/2016","6/30/2019","Clinical and Integrative Cardiovascular Sciences Study Section[CICS]"," ","9777963","ANDERSON, ETHAN JOHN","Not Applicable","01","PHARMACOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF PHARMACY","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","3/15/2017","6/30/2017"," ","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","365252"," ","NHLBI","262530","102722"," ","365252",
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Cancer; Clinical Research; Patient Safety","It is becoming clear that cancer and subsequent treatment impact cognitive function. These deficits may result either from pathological changes due to cancer itself the treatment program or both. Despite the prevalence of cognitive symptoms it is currently difficult to accurately assess the symptoms for a number of reasons. Specifically existing gold standard assessments often lack sensitivity to many cancer related deficits cannot be repeated and thus cannot be  used for monitoring of cognitive change and are generally disconnected from the cognitive psychology and neuroscience tasks that inform our current mechanistic understanding of cognitive function. We have developed a mobile platform for collecting cognitive and behavioral data that overcomes the issues noted  above. In the current proposal our objective are to 1) develop a cancer-specific cognitive assessment tool that can be  used with minimal supervision inside or outside of a clinic 2) develop a clinician dashboard that provides access to data collected through the platform and 3) perform comprehensive usability testing of the prototype product with a group of clinicians and patients with cancer.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Dementia; Diagnostic Radiology; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is projected by 2050 to affect approximately 13.8 million Americans and cost 1.2trillion dollars per year. Insulin resistance (IR) a reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin is typicallyinduced by obesity. In late middle-age IR is associated with deficits in memory and executive functionperformance and increased AD risk. The applicant Dr. Auriel Willette recently found using MagneticResonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data that IR in late middle-aged adults isassociated with atrophy lower glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in prefrontal cortex (PFC) a brain areaimpacted by early AD that subserves executive function. He also previously found that long-term calorierestriction (CR) in aged rhesus macaques lowers IR reduces PFC atrophy associated with IR and improvescognitive performance. The goal of this project is to determine if a previously validated intermittent CR diet thatreduces IR in late middle-aged adults composed of five ad libitum days and two consecutive days ofconsuming 530 kilocalories (5-2 CR) improves executive function performance and changes PFC functionalMRI (fMRI) activation during executive tasks. To accomplish this project Dr. Willette requires additionalsupervised research training in human 5-2 CR clinical trials task-based fMRI neuroimaging cognitive testingAD neuropathology and endocrinology specific to insulin signaling. Dr. Willette's primary mentor at theNational Institute on Aging Dr. Mark Mattson is a leader in CR neuroscience and conducting CR clinicaltrials. Dr. Willette will work with a cross-disciplinary team of intramural and extramural co-mentors to gain therequired training for performing this study. Specifically Dr. Willette will add to his two years of clinicalexperience by being trained in conducting clinical trials through Dr. Josephine Egan the NIA Clinical Directorand Chief of the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation Dr. Mattson and Dr. Dimitrios Kapogiannis a tenure-trackNeurologist who has conducted several clinical trials. Dr. Willette will develop expertise in task-based fMRI andcognitive testing from Dr. Kapogiannis Dr. Arthur Kramer a leader in the field of cognition and aging with over30 years of neuroimaging experience and Dr. Richard O'Brien Chair of Neurology at Johns HopkinsUniversity. For AD neuropathology Drs. Mattson and O'Brien are established experts in animal models andolder adults respectively. For insulin signaling Dr. Egan is a senior investigator and pioneer in the field ofinsulin regulation incretins and glucose metabolism. In Aims 1 and 2 (K99 mentored phase) 40 cognitivelynormal late middle-aged women with IR on a given visit will engage in a battery of executive function tasksoutside of the MRI scanner perform a fMRI color-word Stroop task that induces PFC brain activity andperform a fMRI energy-dense food preference task that also activates PFC through cognitive appraisal of food.This testing will occur at baseline and after 8 weeks of either 5-2 CR (n=20) or an ad libitum control diet (n=20).Compliance visits will be conducted every 2 weeks. This project will be conducted through the Laboratory ofClinical Investigation at Harbor Hospital the NIA's clinical research unit. The NIA Scientific Review Committeehas approved this project and through the Intramural Research Program has adequate resources anddedicated personnel time to be completed in a timely manner. Additional training will include coursework inclinical trials neurobiology of aging ethics management seminars and workshops for prospectiveindependent investigators including grant writing and tenure-track topics. In Aim 3 (R00 independent phase)Dr. Willette will combine his previous and new training to conduct a similar 5-2 CR intervention in aged patientswith Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and IR. In addition to cognition and fMRI he will acquire and processfluorodeoxyglucose data (FDG-PET) to examine resting glucose uptake in PFC. He will gain FDG-PET trainingduring the K99 phase from Dr. Bradley Christian senior PET researcher and co-director of PET Physics at theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to understand how thoracic multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) combined with innovative image analysis techniques can be used to identify COPD patients at greatest risk. The overall objective of this proposal is to focus on the pulmonary vasculature. We hypothesize that novel quantitative MDCT-based metrics that characterize heterogeneity of pulmonary parenchymal perfusion and pulmonary vascular anatomy in early stage COPD subjects will allow us to identify subjects at greater risk for rapid disease progression. Numerous observations from our own laboratories and others point to an abnormal pulmonary vascular response to smoking induced parenchymal inflammation that leads to the development of emphysema. We have established imaging methods for the quantitative assessment of the pulmonary vascular tree and regional pulmonary parenchymal perfusion status. The former measure takes advantage of volumetric MDCT and the later makes use of dual energy MDCT (DE-MDCT) to provide clinically implementable tools for the interrogation of lung structure and function. Our Specific Aims are as follows: (1) determine whether objective quantitative measures of increased PBV heterogeneity derived from DE-MDCT as an index of emphysema susceptibility will serve as a very early indicator of rapid emphysema progression (assessed by MDCT) and lung function decline; (2) determine whether anatomic changes in pulmonary vascular geometry will identify subjects at risk for more rapid emphysema progression and lung function decline possibly in more urgent need of intervention; and (3) determine whether early anatomic and functional markers of vascular disease will combine to identify subjects at increased risk for development of frequent exacerbations who require more intense therapy before significant lung function decline has occurred. In this time-sensitive proposal we will leverage the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). SPIROMICS offers a unique opportunity to study at risk smokers and individuals with COPD in a longitudinal study that are well-characterized in terms of repeated clinical physiological and biological evaluations. We propose to insert a baseline DE-MDCT scan to evaluate an index of pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity (Perfused Blood Volume: PBV) in 200 GOLD 0/I subjects at baseline and to insert a 3rd year MDCT exam into the SPIROMICS protocol for these same individuals. We also propose a year 3 MDCT exam in an additional 125 GOLD II-III SPIROMICS subjects. Our over-riding goal is to evaluate early functional and anatomic indices of vascular dysfunction to determine the association between these metrics and rate of emphysema progression lung function decline and risk of AECOPD.","3-Dimensional;Acute;Adopted;Anatomy;Biological;Biological Markers;Blood Vessels;Blood Volume;Blood flow;Chest;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Complex;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Etiology;Evaluation;Frequencies;Funding;Geometry;Goals;Heterogeneity;Hypoxia;Image;Image Analysis;Individual;Inflammation;Intervention;Laboratories;Lesion;Longitudinal Studies;Lung;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Outcome Measure;Parents;Pathology;Patients;Perfusion;Peripheral;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Predisposition;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary Emphysema;Pulmonary Hypertension;Resolution;Respiratory physiology;Risk;Role;Scanning;Smoker;Smoking;Staging;Structural defect;Structure;Study Subject;Target Populations;Techniques;Testing;Time;Tissues;Tobacco smoke;Trees;United States National Institutes of Health;Vascular Diseases;X-Ray Computed Tomography;alveolar destruction;animal data;base;cohort;contrast enhanced;detector;follow-up;imaging biomarker;imaging modality;improved;indexing;innovation;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;public health relevance;pulmonary function;repaired;response;tool;vascular abnormality;vascular bed;vasoconstriction","Defining the role of early pulmonary vascular disease in COPD","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We seek to evaluate the role of imaging-based measures of pulmonary vascular structure and function to identify smokers at risk of rapid emphysema progression and/or at risk of having frequent acute exacerbations of their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetics; Hematology; Lymphoma; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer Genes and Pathways Research in the newly restructured Cancer Genes and Pathways (CGP) program focuses on the study of biologically significant genetic alterations and molecular pathways that underlie cancer development and immune surveillance. The primary goal of this basic science program is to better understand fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis and cancer immunology thereby defining new molecular entities that can be exploited as disease biomarkers and/or innovative anti-cancer therapies. This is accomplished through three overlapping research themes centered on 1) genome organization regulation and cancer gene expression 2) cellular proliferation survival and transformation and 3) tumor immunosurveillance. Key scientific achievements over the prior funding period include advances in understanding mechanisms of damaged DNA repair and replication identification and characterization of novel tumor-promoting genetic alterations and cancer gene networks development of innovative animal models of cancer and determination of pathways controlling B and T lymphocyte survival and activation. CGP membership includes 54 full and 6 associate members spanning 16 departments (10 basic science 6 clinical) across 3 colleges. Annual CGP total funding for peer-reviewed research in the last budget year was $10.36 million ($2 NCI funding) and $1.99 million for non-peer-reviewed research projects. CGP members are highly collaborative having authored or co-authored 353 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past 4 years with 17% (n=59) intra-programmatic 22% (n=77) inter-programmatic and 32% (n=113) inter-institutional. 49 manuscripts appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor >10).

"Aging; Arthritis; Clinical Research; Osteoarthritis; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic painful disorder that is the most frequent cause of mobility disability in older people. The MOST study has been a major source of new knowledge about the course of this disease and factors that affect its course. Since the study began in 2003 it is increasingly recognized that by the time people develop chronic symptoms of knee OA they usually have advanced structural findings of disease on MRI. Findings such as meniscal tears malalignment and cartilage loss drive further structural deterioration and almost certainly limit prevention opportunities. We believe that prevention opportunities are likely to be greater if started in those who do not yet have severe continuous knee pain or advanced structural findings of disease. The functional impacts of knee OA occur in older people who experience multiple musculoskeletal comorbidities and preventing disablement from OA requires a broader perspective than a focus on a single knee. For example those with pain in one knee are at high risk of pain in other lower extremity musculoskeletal regions and even if the knee is replaced they may ultimately need treatment for pain in other joints developing as a consequence of the first joint affected. Also in additionto functional loss persons with OA experience buckling falls and constraints in their involvement with the outside environment. We suggest there are opportunities to develop treatments and disease prevention strategies that have been unexplored and that by using new technologies and focusing on persons at a milder or earlier disease stage than previous studies we can identify such opportunities. We propose to recruit a new mild disease cohort and continue to study the existing MOST cohort to identify new risk factors for disease and to study consequences of disease. Our goal is to find new strategies to prevent disease at an early stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred.","Acute;Address;Affect;Age;Animal Model;Arthritis;Biomechanics;Bone Density;Calcium;Cartilage;Chronic;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Degenerative polyarthritis;Deposition;Deterioration;Development;Disease;Elderly;Employee Strikes;Environment;Evaluation;Frequencies;Gait;Goals;Health;Heel;Hip region structure;Inflammation;Iowa;Joints;Knee;Knee Osteoarthritis;Knee joint;Knowledge;Lead;Lower Extremity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Muscle Weakness;Musculoskeletal;Outcome;Pain;Pain management;Persons;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Recruitment Activity;Risk;Risk Factors;Sensory;Severities;Source;Staging;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;Time;Walking;age related;base;bone;chronic pain;cohort;disability;disorder prevention;experience;falls;functional loss;high risk;insight;joint injury;knee pain;loss of function;member;new technology;novel;persistent symptom;prevent","Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) Second Renewal: Iowa Clinical Center","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knee osteoarthritis which causes chronic knee pain affects at least 12% of persons age 60 and over and is the most common cause of disability in elders yet little is available to treat or prevent this disease.

"Clinical Research; Urologic Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While some patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) have etiologies limited to peripheral or end- organ dysfunction (e.g. bladder urethra vagina prostate and/or pelvic floor muscle dysfunction) we hypothesize that many patients have central or systemic pathophysiologic processes contributing to their symptoms. For example women and men with a history of childhood or adult trauma and those with psychological co-morbidities may represent one group of patients who have a systemic process causing or contributing to their LUTD. To better understand and develop targeted treatment approaches for patients with such central LUTD the Iowa Research Site proposes to perform multicenter and multidisciplinary research with other sites to 1) develop and test an innovative symptom-based instrument for men and women which will better characterize LUTD patients' urologic symptoms and symptom-related bother and 2) collect detailed and extensive longitudinal data (including symptom-based outcome measures and biomarkers) in men and women with LUTD to better understand phenotypic subgroups of patients. We will recruit equal numbers of men and women with clinically- and urodynamically-defined LUTD including detrusor overactivity with or without urge incontinence stress urinary incontinence and obstruction. Data collection will occur at baseline monthly and at 12 months including symptom progression and flares. Furthermore we will obtain both systemic (salivary cortisol serum C-reactive protein and resting heart rate and blood pressure) and urinary (inflammatory cytokines neurotropins stress proteins tissue remodeling proteins) biomarkers related to neuroendocrine dysfunction and systemic inflammation which may correlate with systemic vs. peripheral LUTD phenotypes.","Adaptive Behaviors;Address;Adult;Affect;Area;Biological Markers;Bladder;Blood Pressure;C-reactive protein;Characteristics;Childhood;Comorbidity;Data;Data Collection;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease regression;Etiology;Flare;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Heart Rate;Heat shock proteins;Hydrocortisone;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Information Systems;Interdisciplinary Study;Iowa;Longitudinal Studies;Lower urinary tract;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Mental Health;Methods;Neurosecretory Systems;Obstruction;Organ;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Pelvic Floor Muscle;Peripheral;Phenotype;Process;Prostate;Psychological Impact;Questionnaires;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Rest;Salivary;Serum;Site;Stress Urinary Incontinence;Subgroup;Symptoms;Testing;Tissues;Trauma;Urethra;Urge Incontinence;Urologic Diseases;Vagina;Variant;Woman;associated symptom;base;clinical phenotype;cytokine;design;effective therapy;expectation;health related quality of life;improved;innovation;instrument;lower urinary tract symptoms;men;men&apos;s group;neurotropin;prevent;protein biomarkers;psychologic;stress protein;targeted treatment;tool;urinary;urologic","Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN)","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this project will improve our ability to assess patients' lower urinary tract symptoms and symptom- related bother.

"Atherosclerosis; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Genetics; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease; Nutrition; Prevention","The whole diet the combination of foods and beverages is important in the prevention and treatment ofcoronary heart disease (CHD). Dietary intake is a life-long environmental factor indispensable for humans.Although the gene-environment interaction is pivotal in CHD it is not completely known how the whole dietregulates gene expression and whether such regulation is a mechanistic link between the whole diet and CHD.MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. Dietary patterns have been used toevaluate the whole diet. In our pilot studies we demonstrated that miRs were associated with a healthy wholediet pattern modified Mediterranean diet (mMedDiet) pattern and were prospectively associated with CHD.Thus our overall objective is to prospectively investigate dietary modulation of miRs and CHD for betterunderstanding of dietary regulation of gene expression and its relation to CHD in the large cohort. Ourpreliminary data showed that a mMedDiet pattern was prospectively associated with low CHD risk in a well-characterized community cohort the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC). Similarly ourpublished data showed that a mMedDiet pattern was prospectively related to lower subclinical atherosclerosisin a well-characterized multi-ethnic cohort the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Therefore wepropose a two-phase individually matched case-control (1:2) study nested in both ARIC and MESA cohorts.Matching on age sex race field center calendar date for plasma collection and freeze/thawing cycle usingrisk-set sampling we will include 412 incident CHD cases and 824 risk-set matched controls from ARIC (phase1 for next-generation sequencing based miR measures) and for phase 2 replication  361 incident CHD casesand 722 risk-set matched controls from MESA. To capture the complex nature of the whole diet and numeroussynergies and antagonism among food items (including nutrients food components and substances such asadditives and preservatives) we will use multiple healthy dietary patterns. Systemic miRs will be profiled inplasma using the state-of-the art small RNA-seq in ARIC and candidate and screened miRs will be measuredusing qPCR in ARIC and MESA. We aim to determine cost-efficiently: 1) whether the whole diet representedby healthy dietary patterns is prospectively associated with miRs; and 2) whether pre-diagnosis miRs that areprospectively related to incident CHD are associated with whole diet. We will identify diet-related and CHD-relatedmiRs from candidate miRs and other miRs. We will further assess to what extent miRs explain the difference inCHD risk between participants with higher diet scores and those with lower diet scores. Findings from ourstudy will shed light on miRs as a novel pathway linking whole diet to CHD event and will provide insight intothe use of miRs as novel biomarkers for dietary regulation of genes and as proxies to evaluate new therapeuticapproaches and public health strategies to prevent CHD events.","Address;Age;Anthropometry;Atherosclerosis;Attention;Beverages;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Calendar;Clinical;Collection;Communities;Complex;Coronary heart disease;Data;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diet;Dietary Component;Dietary Practices;Dietary intake;Dimensions;Disease;Environmental Risk Factor;Evaluation;Event;Food;Freezing;Frequencies;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Goals;Human;Individual;Institutes;Knowledge;Life;Life Style;Light;Link;Literature;Logistic Regressions;Measures;Mediterranean Diet;Methodology;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Molecular;Nature;Nested Case-Control Study;Nutrient;Outcome;Participant;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phase;Pilot Projects;Plasma;Prevention;Prospective Studies;Proxy;Public Health;Publishing;Questionnaires;Race;Regulation;Research;Resources;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Risk;Risk Factors;Sampling;Small RNA;Systems Biology;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Validation;Visit;Woman;base;case control;circulating microRNA;cohort;cost;demographics;design;gene environment interaction;gene interaction;good diet;heart disease risk;innovation;insight;men;next generation sequencing;novel;novel marker;novel therapeutic intervention;phase 1 study;phase 2 study;prevent;prospective;screening;sequencing platform;sex;socioeconomics;transcriptome sequencing","miRNAs Whole Diet and Coronary Heart Disease","A prospective study of miRNAs that examines the influence of pre-diagnostic miRNA levels onincident coronary heart disease and the influence of whole diet on later-on miR levels can beperformed through comparing nested cases with controls for understanding of a novel diet-geneinteraction on coronary heart disease.

"Aging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Hematology","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thrombotic complications such as cardiovascular diseases and stroke are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our aging population. Despite the strong clinical association between aging and thrombosis the mechanisms of thrombosis in the elderly are not well understood. In a recent study we demonstrated that aged mice display increased susceptibility to thrombosis. Our findings also revealed that aged mice develop increased intra-platelet hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and platelet hyperactivity (increased integrin aIIb3 activation). Importantly genetic approaches to eliminate H2O2 prevented platelet hyperactivity in aged mice suggesting that H2O2 is a critical mediator. Importantly our pilot studies in human subjects demonstrate that platelets from aged humans exhibit peroxide mediated hyperactivity The objectives of this application are to identify the upstream mechanism leading to accumulation of H2O2 in platelets and to determine whether prevention of H2O2-mediated platelet hyperactivity decreases aging-associated increased thrombotic susceptibility. Our central hypothesis is that aging results in increased arterial and venous thrombotic susceptibility via enhanced platelet activation in a pathway that includes generation of superoxide by a Nox2- containing NADPH oxidase followed by conversion of superoxide to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) leading to H2O2-induced enhancement of platelet activation. The rationale for this hypothesis is that Nox2- containing NADPH oxidase is the major source of platelet reactive oxygen species and our recent study demonstrated upregulation of NADPH oxidase and SOD1 in platelets from aged mice. Aim 1 will determine the mechanistic roles of NADPH oxidase and SOD1 in platelet hyperactivation in aging. Aim 2 will determine whether inhibition of H2O2-mediated platelet hyperactivity is sufficient to decrease thrombotic susceptibility with aging. Studies will utilize a novel mouse model in which endogenous platelets are immunodepleted prior to transfer of platelets from aged or young mice allowing assessment of the effects of donor platelets on arterial occlusion and venous thrombosis in the absence of potential confounding effects of host platelets. Aim 3 will evaluate hyperactivity of platelets from aged humans and its thrombotic consequences. Understanding the mechanism by which platelet activation with aging contributes to thrombotic susceptibility has the potential to reveal new therapeutic strategies to minimize vascular decline in the elderly.","Adoptive Transfer;Aging;Antibodies;Biological Assay;Blood Platelets;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Clinical;Coagulation Process;Collaborations;Comorbidity;Data;Deep Vein Thrombosis;Elderly;Enzymes;Epidemiologic Studies;Epitopes;Event;Exhibits;Generations;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Hyperactive behavior;Incidence;Integrins;Life Expectancy;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;NADPH Oxidase;Oxidases;Pathway interactions;Peptides;Peroxides;Pilot Projects;Platelet Activation;Population;Predisposition;Prevention;Pulmonary Embolism;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research Personnel;Role;Source;Stress;Superoxides;Surface;Testing;Thrombosis;Thrombus;Transgenic Organisms;Up-Regulation;Venous;Venous Thrombosis;Wild Type Mouse;Work;age effect;age related;aged;aging population;artery occlusion;base;genetic approach;glutathione peroxidase;human subject;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;mortality;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;older patient;overexpression;prevent;research study;stroke","Peroxide mediated prothrombotic effects of aging","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart attack and stroke due to clot formation in blood vessels are common causes of morbidity and mortality in aging.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Radiation Oncology","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT) is a novel form of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) delivered through shielded rotating catheters which provide unprecedented control over radiation dose distributions. RSBT is expected to provide superior sub-volume boosting and toxicity relative to any existing radiotherapy modality resulting in a paradigm shift in HDR-BT for many cancer sites. Although RSBT was conceptualized more than ten years ago its clinical implementation poses tremendous challenges demanding fundamentally advanced innovative technologies. With recent development of radiation sources an effective and efficient RSBT treatment planning system has become a limiting factor for clinical development of RSBT. To this end this project will develop fundamentally novel technology and algorithms to break the formidable computational barriers to bring RSBT into clinic.  We hypothesize that rotating shield brachytherapy powered with advanced treatment planning techniques and software will provide significant dosimetric improvements in tumor coverage and critical structure avoidance relative to conventional HDR-BT with a clinically acceptable delivery time. We propose to: 1) Develop an efficient compressed sensing based RSBT inverse dose optimization method enabling  sparse intensity modulation and optimized homogeneity of dose distributions with smooth fluence  maps in the resulting treatment plan. 2) Develop efficient shield sequencing methods to optimize the delivery of RSBT treatment plans striving to achieve the best tradeoff between plan quality and treatment time and to facilitate clinicians' decision making on selecting the best patient-specifi treatment plan. 3) Dosimetrically validate the RSBT treatment planning system retrospectively with clinical cases of cervical cancers and prostate cancers previously treated with HDR-BT. As a result our project will pave the road to make RSBT clinically available triggering a new era inbrachytherapy delivery.","Algorithms;Applications Grants;Attenuated;Automobile Driving;Biomedical Engineering;Brachytherapy;Breast;Cancer Patient;Catheters;Cervix Uteri;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Combinatorial Optimization;Complex;Complication;Computer software;Decision Making;Development;Discipline;Dose;Electronics;Endometrium;Epidural Anesthesia;Foundations;General Anesthesia;Goals;Health;High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy;Image;Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy;Interdisciplinary Study;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Maps;Medical Computer Science;Methods;Modality;Motion;Nature;Organ;Patients;Performance;Phase;Physics;Planning Techniques;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prostate;Radiation;Radiation Oncology;Radiation therapy;Rectum;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Risk;Source;Spinal Anesthesia;Structure;System;Techniques;Technology;Time;Toxic effect;Treatment Effectiveness;Vagina;arm;base;cancer site;dosimetry;empowered;human subject;improved;innovation;innovative technologies;meetings;new technology;next generation;novel;tool;treatment planning;tumor","Developing a Treatment Planning System for Next Generation Rotating-Shield Brachytherapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project is directed to establish a novel rotating-shield brachytherapy (RSBT) treatment planning system to advance high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-RT) to a new paradigm.

"No NIH Category available","ESRPS Project Summary NarrativeGiven the large impact of Iowa's egg handling industry providing high quality inspections based onthe scientific principles of feed/food safety is paramount to protecting Iowans and consumersthroughout the nation and world. Furthermore the President has provided a significant level of focuson food safety nationally as has Congress with the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act(FSMA). Similarly within Iowa we have found an added interest in food safety.Because of the Congress passage of FSMA the Bureau has identified that we will be no longer ableto keep up with the growing number of questions and requests to provide assistance and speak tovarious groups regarding egg safety. As part of the ESRPS cooperative agreement option theBureau is requesting funding to help answer these questions. The Bureau will hire a new employeeto oversee this endeavor. It will also be necessary to restructure duties of existing staff usingESRPS funding at the beginning of this grant to allow the program to organize. Continuing thisendeavor is absolutely essential to meet the needs of Iowans interested in adding value to allagricultural commodities. However the State's resources are currently not adequate to respond tothe growing needs of egg handlers and consumers across Iowa.The Bureau anticipates participation in this cooperative agreement will result in significantenhancement in the quality of inspections and inspectors egg and bio-security knowledge for Iowa'segg handling facilities. This will be obtained by the following:  The State will achieve and sustain significant to full conformance with the Egg Safety Regulatory Program Standards (ESRPS);  The State has and will continue to actively engage through an annual face-to face meeting (if applicable) and participation in committees supporting ESRPS;  The State has and will collaboratively develop strategies and share those strategies with FDA States Counties and local agencies;  The State will work with FDA establishing the foundation for pursuing regulatory action based upon the findings of state inspections at state egg handler facilities; and  The State will seek to further enhance its capability to protect public health through development and implementation of Standard Enhancement Projects.The goal of this project is to attain full conformance.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza","Abstract The Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion system (T3SS) functions like a molecularsyringe to inject toxins into host cells. The primary cellular targets are phagocytes and epithelialcells. The injected toxins promote phagocytic avoidance and tissue destruction resulting insystemic spread of the bacteria and overwhelming sepsis. Deployment of the T3SS is highlyregulated and only activated when bacteria contact host cell surfaces. The overriding hypothesisguiding the studies is that increased understanding of mechanisms that regulate T3SS geneexpression will lead to the identification of critical steps that can be targeted by anti-virulencetherapeutics the long term goal of the proposed work. The primary protein required for contact-dependent activation of the T3SS is a transcription factor called ExsA. Preliminary datademonstrate that exsA transcription ExsA synthesis and ExsA activity are each subject tocontrol by global regulatory systems. The goals of this proposal are to define novel mechanismsthat control exsA transcription and possibly ExsA synthesis or activity. Our preliminary datademonstrate that the 300 bp intergenic region located between exsB and exsA functions in twocapacities. First the intergenic region contains a Vfr-dependent promoter dedicated to exsAtranscription. Vfr is cAMP-dependent transcription factor previously known to regulate T3SSgene expression but the mechanism has not been defined. Second expression of the intergenicregion in trans has a stimulatory effect on T3SS gene expression. Unclear is whether thestimulatory activity is an RNA or a protein. The three aims will characterize the stimulatoryactivity of the intergeneic region and factors that regulate intergenic promoter activity as follows: Aim 1. Characterize the stimulatory (trans-acting) activity of the exsB-exsA intergenic region. Aim 2. Characterize IR promoter activity. Aim 3. Determine whether Vfr MvaT/MvaU and VqsM function together antagonistically or independently to modulate IR promoter activity.","Accounting;Animals;Bacteria;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical Genetics;Cell surface;Cells;ChIP-seq;Cyclic AMP;DNA Binding;Data;Elements;Epithelial Cells;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Genetic Complementation Test;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Histones;Human;Infection;Initiator Codon;Intercistronic Region;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Maps;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Nosocomial pneumonia;Open Reading Frames;Operon;Phagocytes;Phenotype;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Postoperative Period;Property;Proteins;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;RNA;Regulation;Role;Sepsis;Site;Syringes;System;Therapeutic;Tissues;Toxin;Transcript;Transcription Coactivator;Translating;Type III Secretion System Pathway;Urinary tract;Virulence;Work;abstracting;arm;cellular targeting;cytotoxic;expectation;genetic approach;interest;mutant;novel;pathogen;promoter;quorum sensing;research study;transcription factor","Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa type III secretion","NarrativePseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes life-threatening infectionsin humans and is reliant on mechanism used to inject toxins into host cells.

It also supports highthroughput screening for studies exploring the biology of cancer.The automatic miniaturized and parallel high-throughput approaches foster hit and lead generation for drugdiscovery and development through screening of systematic unbiased large chemical/biologics libraries.These strategies also facilitate molecular probe discovery for mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies of chemicalbiology through screening of focused intellectually designed compound collections. In addition these high-throughput approaches aid the interrogation of cells especially those derived from patients.The HTS was established in 2012 by university sponsors including the HCCC and an NIH S10 SharedInstrumentation grant funding. HTS is equipped to perform high-throughput screening in 96- 384- and 1536-well formats with plate reader detection (Perkin-Elmer EnVision) using absorbance fluorescence andluminescence including advanced FRET and BRET techniques. HTS can also perform high content screening(HCS Perkin-Elmer Operetta Confocal Imaging System) to detect and quantify phenotypic changes i.e. celldifferentiation cell migration neurite outgrowth and target trafficking; or by fluorescence intensities for targetprotein expression transcription factor or signaling pathway analysis. Systems available in the HTS areintegrated with robotics for plate handling and assay execution suitable for small- or large-scale compoundlibrary screens with walk-away levels of automation. HTS currently holds five small molecule librariescontaining approximately 140000 compounds. In addition HTS is in the process of determining the need andfeasibility of obtaining a biologics library i.e. genome-wide siRNA antibodies and diverse cell lines.Overall HTS is a shared research resource focused on scalable screening approaches for drug discovery anddevelopment and molecular probe discovery for mechanism-of-action studies for cancer investigators acrosscampus and beyond.","Action Potentials;Antibodies;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Applications Grants;Automation;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Biomedical Research;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center Support Grant;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Line;Cells;Chemicals;Clinical;Collection;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Data Set;Detection;Excretory function;FDA approved;Flow Cytometry;Fluorescence;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer;Fostering;Funding;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genomics Shared Resource;Goals;Grant;Lead;Libraries;Ligands;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolism;Microscopy;Mission;Molecular;Molecular Probes;Neurites;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphotransferases;Process;RNA Interference;Reader;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Robotics;Running;Screening for cancer;Services;Signal Pathway;Small Interfering RNA;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic antibodies;Tissues;Toxic effect;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Walking;Xenograft procedure;absorption;cancer cell;cancer therapy;cell motility;chemical synthesis;combinatorial;data management;design;drug development;drug discovery;genetic approach;genome-wide;high throughput screening;imaging system;in vitro testing;instrumentation;luminescence;member;miniaturize;novel;novel strategies;personalized cancer therapy;pre-clinical;protein expression;research facility;screening;small molecule;small molecule libraries;small molecule therapeutics;therapeutic development;trafficking;transcription factor","Cluster B: 7 High Throughput Screening","n/a","NCI","9292694","7/29/2016","PAR-13-386","3P30CA086862-16S2","3","P30","CA","086862","16","S2","PTAK, KRZYSZTOF "," "," ","Cancer Centers Study Section (A)[NCI-A]","7663","10166675","WU, MENG ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","114094"," ","75000","39094"," "," ",

"Genetics; Human Genome","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic instability plays a critical role in carcinogenesis making knowledge about the mechanisms that lead to genome rearrangements and mutagenesis a critical tool in the fight against cancer. This project is focused on a novel type of DNA synthesis migrating-bubble DNA synthesis (MiBS) which promotes bursts of genomic instability including hyper-mutagenesis translocations and copy number variations. In stark contrast to S- phase replication MiBS is initiated at a double-strand break (DSB) site rather than at a replication origin is carried out by a migrating bubble rather than by a replication fork and leads to conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA. This proposal aims to unravel the molecular mechanism of MiBS and to determine how MiBS promotes various types of genetic instabilities characteristic of human cancers. To study MiBS we will use a dependable and powerful system in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where a single DSB initiated by a site-specific HO endonuclease is repaired by break-induced replication (BIR) an important DSB repair pathway which proceeds through MiBS. More specifically a DSB is repaired by invasion of one free end of broken DNA into the homologous chromosome followed by DNA synthesis mediated by MiBS that proceeds for approximately 100 kilobases to the end of the homologue resulting in a repaired molecule with a normal telomere. We will use direct physical methods including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis dynamic molecular combing and electron microscopy to determine the mechanism of MiBS and to characterize the roles of replication proteins that are responsible for it. We will further determine the mechanism of increased mutagenesis promoted by MiBS employ sensitive genetic analyses to fully characterize the role of DNA polymerases in MiBS-associated hypermutability and assess the role of MiBS in the formation of mutation clusters using whole-genome DNA sequencing. Importantly the results of these investigations will shed light on a mechanism of regional hyper-mutability kataegis which has recently been described in various types of cancer. Finally we will determine the role of MiBS in promoting complex GCRs similar to those associated with chromothripsis a cancer-related phenomenon that involves massive genomic changes localized to a single chromosome. Preliminary results obtained in the PI's lab suggest that chromothripsis-like GCRs may occur when DSB repair switches from MiBS to microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR). The proposed research will unravel the mechanism mediating switches from MiBS to MMBIR including the role of translesion DNA polymerases in this process and will determine the role of MMBIR in formation of GCRs. Overall the results of this proposed research are expected to establish a novel concept: the notion that a burst of genetic instabilities that can lead to cancer may result from an unusual type of replication (MiBS) rather than from a continuing accumulation of small genetic changes during semi-conservative S-phase replication.","Biological Assay;Cancer Biology;Cancerous;Chromosomal Rearrangement;Chromosomes;Comb animal structure;Complex;Copy Number Polymorphism;Coupled;DNA;DNA Sequence;DNA biosynthesis;DNA replication fork;DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;Development;Disease;Double Strand Break Repair;Electron Microscopy;Event;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Gene Conversion;Genetic;Genetic Materials;Genome;Genomic Instability;Genomics;Goals;HO nuclease;Health;Homologous Gene;Human;Human Characteristics;Interruption;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Left;Lesion;Light;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammals;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Play;Polymerase;Process;Property;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Replication Error;Replication Origin;Research;Risk;Role;S Phase;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Single-Stranded DNA;Site;Structure;System;Testing;Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis;Work;Yeasts;cancer cell;cancer genome;cancer type;carcinogenesis;chromothripsis;data mining;expectation;fight against;gel electrophoresis;genetic analysis;migration;molecular dynamics;new technology;novel;prevent;repaired;telomere;therapeutic target;tool;tumorigenesis;two-dimensional;whole genome","Amplification of risk resulting from mis-routing of double-strand break repair","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our understanding of tumorigenesis is rapidly evolving as new technologies used in cancer biology detect patterns in cancer genomes that suggest the accumulation of pre-cancerous genetic lesions is not slow and random but more likely to be induced and temporally and spatially clustered.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Pediatric; Substance Abuse","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal drug addiction constitutes a major public health problem for both women and affected children with long lasting consequences on children's social emotional and cognitive development. Current treatment strategies tend to focus on the mother and her current addiction rather than her relationship with her child and developmental processes that may perpetuate the addiction problems such as unresolved childhood attachment trauma neglect and chronic stress. Unlike mothers who find engaging with their own infant to be a uniquely rewarding experience mothers with addictions may be less able to respond appropriately to their infant's cues finding them less intrinsically rewardin or salient and more stress provoking. Our current study has identified key areas in dopaminergic and oxytocinergic brain pathways that show a diminished functional MRI response when addicted mothers view the faces of their own vs. unknown infants compared with non- addicted mothers. These areas include the hypothalamus striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Oxytocin a neuropeptide with decreased peripheral levels seen in addicted mothers is integrally involved in maternal brain and behavioral responses. When administered intranasally our pilot data has shown enhanced activation of the striatum prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The purpose of this renewal grant is to continue and expand upon our investigation of maternal addiction by conducting a randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled crossover study of intranasal oxytocin on maternal brain responses. A new group of 150 mothers from our two current study sites (Baylor College of Medicine and the Yale Child Study Center) will be enrolled (75 with a history of drug addiction and 75 matched control mothers) along with their 4 to 7-month-old infants to participate in four study visits over a two-month period. During Visit 1 mothers will complete the Adult Attachment Interview to determine their attachment classification and to identify markers of unresolved trauma. At Visit 2 a videotaped free-play assessment of mother-infant interaction (the CARE-Index) and a modified Still Face Procedure will be conducted to assess the quality of maternal caregiving and synchrony. During the final two study visits functional MRI will be used to compare maternal brain responses to infant face cues after receiving either intranasal oxytocin or placebo comparing ""own"" vs. ""unknown"" happy and sad faces. We will focus on activation of and functional connectivity between the striatum prefrontal cortex and amygdala key reward and stress related regions containing oxytocinergic neuronal connections. We will also examine factors that may moderate oxytocin's effect in the brain including attachment classification mother-infant synchrony sensation-seeking or risk-taking behavior and stress/trauma exposure. This knowledge will contribute significantly to our long-term goal of discovering novel treatment strategies for mothers who suffer from drug dependency and addiction.","Adult;Affect;Amygdaloid structure;Area;Behavior;Brain;Brain imaging;Child;Child Abuse and Neglect;Childhood;Chronic stress;Classification;Code;Corpus striatum structure;Cross-Over Studies;Crossover Design;Crying;Cues;Data;Development;Developmental Process;Distress;Dopamine;Dorsal;Double-Blind Method;Drug Addiction;Emotional;Enrollment;Esthesia;Face;Family;Figs - dietary;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Glucocorticoids;Goals;Grant;Habits;Health;Hypothalamic structure;Individual Differences;Infant;Interview;Investigation;Knowledge;Literature;Maternal Behavior;Medicine;Modeling;Mothers;Motor output;Negative Valence;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Neurosecretory Systems;Oxytocin;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Placebo Control;Placebos;Play;Positive Valence;Predisposition;Prefrontal Cortex;Procedures;Process;Public Health;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research Domain Criteria;Rewards;Risk-Taking;Site;Smiling;Social Processes;Stress;Substantia nigra structure;System;Thalamic structure;Trauma;Ventral Striatum;Ventral Tegmental Area;Videotape;Visit;Woman;Work;addiction;behavioral response;biological adaptation to stress;brain circuitry;brain pathway;caregiving;cognitive development;college;drug of abuse;experience;indexing;maternal caregiving;neglect;novel;pediatric trauma;response;sensory input;social;treatment strategy","Oxytocin and Brain Reward and Stress Responses to Infant Cues in Addicted Mothers","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug addiction problems in mothers are of major public health significance for both the women and their affected children with long lasting consequences on children's social emotional and cognitive development.

"Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Genetics; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):    The central nervous system (CNS) plays important roles in the regulation of blood pressure and body weight and abnormalities in these pathways can cause both hypertension and obesity. Obesity and hypertension remain a serious health problem worldwide in particular in Western societies where the incidence of hypertension and obesity-associated hypertension continues to rise. The long term goal and central theme of the Central Regulation of Blood Pressure and Metabolism (CRBPM) PPG is to understand fundamental mechanisms by which central angiotensin (ANG) and leptin regulate blood pressure in hypertension and obesity-associated hypertension and their convergence on energy homeostasis. The Program will focus on conditions of activation of the central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and altered leptin signaling in hypertension and diet-induced obesity (DIG) and on the role of brain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidant stress as mechanisms regulating sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) blood pressure and energy homeostasis. The projects will test several novel hypothesis. Project 1 hypothesizes that ER/oxidant stress contributes to the increased renal SNA and blood pressure in DIG mice but conversely acts in the SFG-PVN axis to blunt or reverse brain ANG- and/or leptin-mediated facilitatory effects on thermogenic SNA and energy expenditure in this model of obesity-hypertension. Project 2 will test the hypothesis of that local synthesis of ANG in the brain controls blood pressure water intake and energy expenditure through overlapping yet discrete ANG-dependent mechanisms and efferent pathways and that DIG blunts the effects of brain RAS activation on energy expenditure by stimulating the adipose RAS acting through an AT2R-dependent mechanism. Project 3 will test the hypothesis that Bbs genes in the central nervous system are critical for the control of energy homeostasis and the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and that defects in the brain BBSome receptor trafficking ER stress and the brain RAS are critically involved in the metabolic autonomic and blood pressure alterations associated with BBS. The Program is tightly focused and cohesive and is strengthen by one administrative and two scientific cores.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 20% of those over the age of 75 and 50% over the age of 85. It is difficult to identify early stages of AD and there are no methods to quantitatively follow disease progression. Therapies to slow AD or to cure AD are also absent. One of the neuropathological features of AD is the neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. The discovery of mutations in the tau gene that cause age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia has led to research showing that (1) abnormally phosphorylated tau is sufficient to cause disease and (2) neuronal death is caused by abnormal tau. Moreover AD is now considered a ""tauopathy"". To discover new biomarkers and therapeutics for AD and other tauopathies it is critical to determine how tau causes disease. While many investigators have focused in the well-known property of tau as a microtubule-associated protein we have focused on identifying new properties for tau as there are many microtubule-associated proteins that have no connection to AD. We have found that tau associates with Src-family non-receptor tyrosine kinases and is tyrosine phosphorylated. We have also found that tau can up-regulate kinase activity and that both abnormally phosphorylated and mutated forms of tau can associate more strongly with Fyn a Src-family kinase. In fact other investigators have shown that deleting Fyn is neuroprotective forAD in mouse models. Because tau is tyrosine phosphorylated we investigated the possibility that tau might function as a signal transduction protein. We found that tau potentiated NGF-induced MAPK and AP1 activation in neuronal cells and that phosphorylation of tau at thr231 and tyr18/tyr29 were critical for this new property. Microtubule binding was not involved. In addition we found that tau associated with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in an NGF-dependent manner. In this application we propose to investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation of tau using two approaches. In Specific Aim I we will determine if deletion of Fyn from a tauopathy mouse model alters the tau pathology and neuronal viability in the model. We will also determine if the behavior of the mouse is altered. In Specific Aim II we will investigate thefunction of abnormally phosphorylated tau. Specifically we will investigate the role of phosphorylation in the interaction between tau and SHP2 as well as the functional significance of the interaction. In Specific Aim III we will determine if SHP2 is activated in AD. SHP2 and MAPK activation will also be investigated in a mouse tauopathy model. These aims will (1) advance our knowledge of the mechanisms undertaken by abnormally phosphorylated tau and (2) determine if these mechanisms are taking place during neurodegeneration. Abnormally phosphorylated tau is the earliest sign of neurodegenerative disease and our investigation aims to identify the earliest steps taken towards the neuropathogenic process. Our data will aid in the identification of new targets for disease therapeutics and new biomarkers for tracking disease progress.","Affect;Age;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Animal Model;Behavior;Binding;Biological Markers;Brain;Caring;Cause of Death;Cell Count;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cells;Chemosensitization;Data;Dementia;Disease;Disease Progression;Early Diagnosis;Exhibits;Family;Frontotemporal Dementia;Genes;Goals;Grant;Human;Investigation;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Link;MAP Kinase Gene;MAPT gene;Methods;Microtubule-Associated Proteins;Microtubules;Modeling;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurofibrillary Tangles;Neurons;Neuropathogenesis;PTPN11 gene;PXXP Motif;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patient Care;Patients;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Process;Proline-Rich Domain;Property;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Role;SH3 Domains;Signal Transduction;Staging;Tauopathies;Transcription Factor AP-1;Tyrosine;Tyrosine Phosphorylation;United States;abnormally phosphorylated tau;age related;cost;mouse model;neurofibrillary tangle formation;neuron loss;neuropathology;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutics;src-Family Kinases;tau Proteins;tau function;tau mutation;tau phosphorylation;tau-1;therapeutic biomarker","Tyrosine phosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease","Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and caring for Alzheimer's disease patients costs close to $200 billion per year.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary:The ultimate goal of this research is to predict and optimize deposition of orally inhaled particles in the humanlungs for targeted drug delivery by employing an integrative statistics-guided multi-scale physiologically-realistic imaging-based and subject-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) lung model. To assess inter-subject variability in delivery of oral inhalation drug products to small airways in asthmatic lungs we adopt anovel statistics-guided computational framework that applies cluster analysis to computed tomography (CT)imaging-based structural and functional variables over a population of asthmatic lungs to identify asthmaticsub-populations. We then apply our subject-specific lung model suite to selected representative subjects ineach sub-population to study inter-cluster variability. This strategy allows bridging individual and populationscales. Our airway model and CFD boundary conditions are based on CT volumetric image data of the humanlungs scanned at multiple volumes representing normal and disease phenotypes in a physiologically-realisticand subject-specific manner. Our model is multi-scale because the airway model spans from the mouth cavityto the trachea as a three-dimensional (3D) geometry then to the terminal bronchioles using a novel 3D-1D(three-dimensional large airways coupled with one-dimensional small airways) and 3D-3D (3D large airwayscoupled with 3D small airways) coupled approach bridging from the central airways to the lung parenchyma aswell as describing regional ventilation. Our mechanics model is further integrated with thermodynamics modelsfor heat and water vapor transfer. Our CFD employs large eddy simulation allowing accurate representation oflaminar transitional and turbulent flows under various breathing conditions. To address inter-subject variabilityin small airway delivery we propose the following specific aims. (1) Obtain representative regional ventilationand geometry. (2) Construct physiologically-consistent 3D geometry of small airways. (3) Reproduceheterogeneous airway constriction for asthmatic subjects. (4) Develop oropharyngeal air flow heat watervapor and particle models. (5) Develop acinar air flow and particle models. (6) Simulate air flow heat watervapor and particle in small airways. (7) Validate computer models. We propose to analyze existing non-imaging and imaging databases from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP).

"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are emerging as an enormous public health problem. Up to 80% of PD patients will suffer debilitating cognitive symptoms in the course of their disease. In PD patients cognitive impairments predict a malignant disease course leading to loss of employment independence driving deficits nursing home placement and death. Because PD is strongly associated with aging this problem will surge as our society ages. There are few treatments that improve PD-related cognitive symptoms. Thus there is a critical need to develop new mechanistic treatments for cognitive symptoms of PD. A challenge in developing new treatments is that there is a knowledge gap about the mechanism of PD-related cognitive symptoms. Cognitive deficits in PD patients include impaired working memory attention reasoning planning and timing. One elementary cognitive task in which PD patients are reliably impaired is interval timing. In this task subjects are presented with a stimulus and estimate its duration over several seconds. Interval timing is an ideal window into cognition in PD because this task depends on dopamine and can be readily studied in animal models. Elucidating the neural circuitry of interval timing could help close the knowledge gap about cognitive dysfunction in PD. Our preliminary data strongly implicate D1-type dopamine receptors on pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal area of the cerebral cortex in interval timing. However it is unclear precisely howprefrontal neurons influence interval timing. Here we combine highly selective and specific techniques such as optogenetics focal drug infusions and neuronal ensemble recordings to systematically interrogate the neural activity of prefrontal D1 neurons in great detail and to mapthe projections of these neurons. In Aim 1 we determine how prefrontal D1 neurons control interval timing. In Aim 2 we determine which projections of prefrontal D1 neurons control interval timing. Finally in Aim 3 we rescue interval timing deficits in animal models of PD by stimulating prefrontal D1 neurons and their projections. This work will identify key drivers of a cognitive process impaired in PD patients. Our findings could link a brain region and a receptor system to cognitive processes impaired in PD and could spur development of targeted pharmacological genetic or brain-stimulation therapies. Insights from this work could have relevance for PD as well as for other diseases involving prefrontal dopamine circuits such as schizophrenia ADHD addiction and Huntington's disease.","Affect;Age;Aging;Animal Model;Area;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Brain;Brain region;Cerebral cortex;Cessation of life;Cognition;Cognitive deficits;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Development;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine D1 Receptor;Dopamine Receptor;Dorsal;Employment;Genetic;Goals;Health;Huntington Disease;Impaired cognition;Infusion procedures;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Malignant - descriptor;Maps;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurons;Nursing Homes;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Public Health;Pyramidal Cells;Ramp;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Societies;Stimulus;System;Techniques;Time;Transgenic Mice;Ventral Tegmental Area;Work;addiction;cognitive control;cognitive process;cognitive task;cost;dopaminergic neuron;effective therapy;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;improved;insight;mortality;neural circuit;new therapeutic target;optogenetics;receptor;relating to nervous system;research study;time interval","Prefrontal D1 signaling and cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease cause morbidity and mortality and have no effective treatments.

"Aging; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related","Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) arecoronavirus-mediated human respiratory diseases with high case-fatality rates. Disease is especially severe inaged populations. In the previous funding period we showed that age-dependent increases in prostaglandinD2 (PGD2) and an upstream phospholipase A2 PLA2G2D contributed to poor immune responses anddecreased survival. The lung is in a state of chronic inflammation resulting from continued exposure toenvironmental antigens. We postulated that PLA2G2D which has anti-inflammatory properties is upregulatedto counter this low grade inflammation resulting in delayed responses to innocuous antigens but also to rapidlyreplicating viruses like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Transient blockade of PGD2 signaling or genetic absenceof PLA2G2D greatly increased survival. In marked contrast knock-out of DP1 the PGD2 receptor on myeloidcells converted a sublethal SARS-CoV infection to a lethal one indicating that PGD2/DP1 signaling hasadditonal roles in the infected lung. Our central hypothesis is that PGD2 and PLA2G2D along with othermembers of the small lipid mediator pathways have central roles in modulating the inflammatory state of thelung. In specific they regulate multiple steps in the innate and subsequent T cell responses in mice infectedwith SARS-CoV MERS-CoV and likely other viral respiratory pathogens. This hypothesis will be approachedin the following specific aims: 1. To determine the mechanism of PLA2G2D upregulation and the role ofPLA2G2D in vaccine responses in 12m old mice. CoV replication includes extensive cellular membranerearrangements. The role between these rearrangements the induction of oxidative stress and theupregulation of PLA2G2D will be investigated. 2. To determine the role of PGD2-DP1 signaling in the immuneresponse to SARS-CoV in 12 m mice. The absence of PGD2-DP1 signaling results in diminished rDCactivation and type I IFN (IFN-I) expression and increased inflammasome activation. Our goal is to determinewhether changes in inflammasome activation are the major pathogenic effect of absent PGD2-DP1 signaling orif other factors are also involved. 3. To determine whether PGD2 and PLA2G2D contribute to poorer outcomesin mice infected with MERS-CoV another infection in which severity is age-dependent. Using our newlydeveloped hDPP4-KI mice and mouse-adapted MERS-CoV we will determine whether MERS-CoV in micealso causes an age-dependent disease and whether changes in eicosanoid expression contribute to moresevere disease.","Affect;Age;Age-Years;Aging;Alveolar Macrophages;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antigens;Case Fatality Rates;Cells;Cellular Membrane;Chronic;Coronavirus;Coronavirus Infections;Data;Dendritic Cells;Dendritic cell activation;Dependence;Depressed mood;Dinoprostone;Disease;Dopamine D2 Receptor;Eicosanoids;Elderly;Exposure to;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Human;ITGAX gene;Immune response;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interferons;Knock-in Mouse;Knock-out;Life;Lung;Lung diseases;Mediating;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Mus;Myeloid Cell Activation;Myeloid Cells;Outcome;Oxidative Stress Induction;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phospholipase;Phospholipase A2;Phospholipids;Population;Property;Prostaglandin D2;Prostaglandins;Respiratory Tract Infections;Role;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome;Severities;Severity of illness;Signal Transduction;T cell response;Up-Regulation;Vaccines;Viral;Virulent;Virus;age related;aged;base;cell motility;lipid mediator;lymph nodes;member;middle age;mortality;new therapeutic target;pathogen;receptor;respiratory;response;vaccine response","Role of eicosanoids in pathogenic human CoV infections","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cause severe respiratory disease especially in aged populations.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Pediatric","Project Summary/AbstractStatistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types ofstatistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information basedon linear dependencies e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items whereaslearning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs nouns) thatshare distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with languageimpairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in thesepopulations.Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to havedownstream effects causing poorer comprehension but this relationship has not been experimentally shown.In this project children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an onlinecomprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs amade-up language. In the online comprehension task participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferredinterpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to thedistributional properties of the verb an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LIare sensitive to verb bias effects but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis ofprevious work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In theartificial grammar learning task participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statisticalregularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participantswill form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizingdistributional information from novel input but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by thispopulation suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between themfor the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This studywill provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to usedistributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end we will discover the role ofinput and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments.","Accounting;Adult;Categories;Cereals;Child;Clinical;Complex;Comprehension;Computers;Cues;Dependency;Development;Eating;Environment;Eye;Failure;Future;Goals;Hearing;Individual;Infant;Intervention;Judgment;Knowledge;Language;Language Delays;Language Development;Lead;Learning;Linguistics;Machine Learning;Measurement;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Mus;Nursery Schools;Participant;Performance;Persons;Population;Probability;Process;Property;Qualifying;Research;Role;Semantics;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;Techniques;Testing;Time;Training;Work;abstracting;base;comprehension deficit;experience;farmer;improved;insight;language comprehension;language impairment;natural language;novel;peer;research study;social;sound;syntax;teacher;therapy design","Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment","Project NarrativeThe proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without languageimpairment utilize distributional information in the input specifically as regards to language.

At present there is no preventive or curative treatment for AD orin age-related cognitive decline and clinical trials of cognitive-modifying compounds have notsucceeded in identifying an effective treatment. Despite a lot of efforts no candidates areavailable to slow down the development or even cure this devastating disease. Although most ofthe efforts are focusing on the amyloid and the tau pathways we have taken a differentapproach and targeted oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a major pathogenic mechanism that underlies both the pre-clinicaldevelopment and subsequent progression of AD and one that could potentially be targetedpreventively as well as therapeutically. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase duringinflammation mitochondrial dysfunction and metal redox cycling catalyzed by A all processesassociated with AD development. ROS-catalyzed lipid peroxidation generates bifunctionalelectrophiles (BFEs). We have shown that BFEs generated by oxidative stress accelerate Aoligomerization generating oligomers that have similar neurotoxicity and immunoreactivity asthe amyloid-derived diffusible ligands. They inhibit proteosomal activity cause mitochondrialdysfunction and promote dendritic cell activation of T cells. Importantly we have shown thatlevels of BFE adducts on proteins are significantly elevated in hippocampus of AD post mortemhuman brains and correlate positively with both the CERAD plaque score and the Braak stage. We have found that 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) reacts 1600-fold faster with BFEsthan lysine preventing protein modification in vitro and in vivo. Importantly in hApoE4transgenic mice 2-HOBA inhibits all the effects of BFEs described above and prevents workingmemory deficit. 2-HOBA a natural product present in buckwheat seeds has been developed for use inhumans by Metabolic Technologies Inc. (MTI Ames IA). The chemical manufacturing andcontrol data have been generated and pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology data arecurrently being collected. In this project we propose to do single and multiple escalation dosestudies necessary to characterize pharmacokinetics metabolism and safety of 2-HOBA. Wealso propose to establish brain penetrance of 2-HOBA and to determine whether it reducesblood and CSF markers of oxidative modification of proteins.","Address;Adult;Adverse effects;Adverse event;Affect;Age-associated memory impairment;Aging;Aldehydes;Alzheimer disease prevention;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Amines;Amyloid;Amyloid beta-Protein;Animals;Biological;Biological Availability;Biological Markers;Blood;Blood Platelets;Body Surface Area;Brain;Cause of Death;Chemicals;Clinical;Clinical Pharmacology;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cognitive;Collaborations;Complete Blood Count;Data;Dendritic cell activation;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Evaluation;Functional disorder;Goals;High Density Lipoproteins;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Impaired cognition;In Vitro;Inflammation;Injury;Kidney;Kinetics;Ligands;Lipid Peroxidation;Liver;Lysine;Malondialdehyde;Measures;Memory impairment;Metabolic;Metabolism;Metals;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Muscle;N-methylacetamide-oxotremorine M;Natural Products;No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level;Nutritional;Oral;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;PTGS2 gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetrance;Peptides;Pharmacodynamics;Plasma;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Preventive treatment;Process;Production;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regimen;Research;Safety;Seeds;Short-Term Memory;Spinal Puncture;Staging;T-Lymphocyte;Technology;Testing;Tissues;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Transgenic Mice;Validation;adduct;age related;amyloid peptide;base;clinical toxicology;crosslink;curative treatments;cyclooxygenase 1;effective therapy;immunoreactivity;in vivo;manufacturing process;mild cognitive impairment;mitochondrial dysfunction;neurotoxic;neurotoxicity;novel;pre-clinical;prevent;protein folding;protein function;research study;small molecule;tau Proteins;volunteer","2-Hydroxybenzylamine for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease: Initial evaluation in humans","Alzheimers disease is the 5th cause of death for people over 65 and over 5 millionAmericans suffer from it.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Genetics; Prevention; Smoking and Health; Substance Abuse; Tobacco","Smoking is the most common preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Each yearsmoking causes the premature death of over 450000 Americans and $200 billion of economic damage.Effective treatment is possible but barriers to its implementation limits the success rate of smoking cessation inthe general population to about 5%. Notably reward based incentive smoking cessation methods could tripleor quadruple that abysmal response rate. But their implementation is hindered by a number of factors-mostimportantly the lack of a good biomarker for quantifying the decrease of cigarette consumption or reduction inharm (RIH). In a very successful prior R43 project we demonstrated that methylation at cg05575921 as quantified byour Smoke Signature assay increases as a function of successful smoking cessation and that DNAmethylation at cg05575921 reliably distinguishes non-smokers from smokers (with an AUC of 0.99) and 2)methylation at cg05575921 regresses to mean as a function of the success of smoking cessation. Howeverour data are incomplete since the cohorts used in this Phase I study were limited in size and ethnic diversity.In this Phase II project we will confirm and extend those findings into a more generally representativepopulation and develop CLIA compliant processes that can be used to translate this Phase I finding into FDAapproved digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) test (a.k.a Smoke Signature) for monitoring of smoking cessation. In this Phase II project we will collect and characterize an ethnically diverse group of 250 subjects as theyundergo smoking cessation therapy. We will then determine their DNA methylation as a function of smokingcessation success. From this we will produce a refined reversion curve that can be used in biomarker guidedtherapy and create other data for the FDA submission of our assay. Our project will have high commercial andclinical impact because the Smoke Signature assay could create the basis for an improved clinical paradigmfor the treatment of smoking and be an unambiguous indicator of smoking for civil (e.g. insurance companiesetc) assessments of smoking status. Our plan is highly feasible because of Behavioral Diagnostic's control ofrelevant intellectual property expertise in clinical epigenetics an operational ddPCR methylation assayaccess to subjects and staff of experienced clinicians. It is innovative because epigenetic techniques have notyet been incorporated into behavioral medicine.

"Aging; Brain Disorders; Neurosciences","Mitochondria play a central role in cell metabolism and control multiple aspects of neuronal signaling. Byefficiently buffering Ca2+ influx during neuronal excitation and slowly releasing Ca2+ back into the cytosolmitochondria shape [Ca2+]i transients and regulate Ca2+-dependent neuronal functions such as excitabilitysynaptic transmission and gene expression. Ca2+ rise in the mitochondrial matrix stimulates Ca2+-dependentdehydrogenases and boosts ATP production to meet the increase in energy demand during excitation.However mitochondrial overload with Ca2+ can kill neurons and mitochondrial Ca2+ dysregulation is implicatedin neuronal damage during stroke and in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson'sdiseases. Despite the importance of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport to neuronal life and death the molecules thatmediate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release in neurons are not known. This knowledge gap presents amajor obstacle in our progress toward understanding and therapeutically correcting mitochondrial functions inneurons. The main objectives of this proposal are to identify molecules that mediate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptakein peripheral and central neurons and to establish their roles in neuronal Ca2+ signaling ATP synthesissynaptic transmission and excitotoxicity. Our preliminary studies indicate that two novel molecules MCU(CCDC109A) and MCUb (CCDC109B) are broadly expressed in the peripheral and central nervous systemsand that MCU is required for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in neurons whereas MCUb inhibits this Ca2+ transportmechanism. Moreover our pilot data using MCU KO mice showed that MCU loss dramatically but notcompletely reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake altered Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial function and providedremarkable protection against glutamate-induced toxicity. Our central hypothesis is that MCU and MCUb playimportant but opposite roles in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in neurons bioenergetics Ca2+signaling and synaptic transmission and that knockout of MCU but not of MCUb protects neurons fromexcitotoxicity and reduces neuronal damage in ischemic stroke. We will employ a multidisciplinary approachinvolving genetic Ca2+ and ATP sensors patch-clamp recording knockout mice and a mouse model ofischemic stroke to test this hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will establish the roles of MCU and MCUbin mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and Ca2+ signaling in central and peripheral neurons. Aim 2 will examine theimpact of MCU and MCUb on presynaptic Ca2+ signaling and synaptic transmission. Aim 3 will establish theroles of MCU and MCUb in excitotoxicity and ischemic stroke. We anticipate that this work will betransformative because it will establish the molecular basis for genetic and pharmacological manipulation ofmitochondrial Ca2+ transport in neurons and may lead to the development of new therapeutics that targetmitochondrial Ca2+ uniporters for treating stroke and other neurological disorders associated with excitotoxicity.","ATP Synthesis Pathway;Action Potentials;Agonist;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Back;Bioenergetics;Buffers;Cellular Metabolic Process;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Cytosol;Data;Development;Electrophysiology (science);Gene Expression;Genetic;Glutamates;Hippocampus (Brain);Homeostasis;Image;Inner mitochondrial membrane;Ischemia;Ischemic Stroke;Killings;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Mediating;Membrane Potentials;Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Matrix;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Oxidoreductase;Parkinson Disease;Peripheral;Play;Production;Regulation;Role;Sensory;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Spinal Ganglia;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;TRPV1 gene;Testing;Toxic effect;Work;base;excitotoxicity;in vivo;interdisciplinary approach;meetings;mitochondrial membrane;mouse model;nervous system disorder;neuron loss;neuronal survival;neuroprotection;neurotoxicity;neurotransmission;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;patch clamp;presynaptic;research study;response;sensor;stroke;stroke treatment;uptake","Molecular Mechanisms and Functions of Mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in Neurons","Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays important role in neuronal signaling and ATP production.

"Burden of Illness; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Pediatric","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasingly recognized in children with an incidence approaching that of adults. Most children with pancreatitis have a single mild acute episode that resolves without complications. However a subset of children with AP develops recurrent episodes (defined as acute recurrent pancreatitis or ARP) and some progress to chronic pancreatitis (CP). Few studies have been performed to characterize ARP and CP in children. We recognized that the lack of a well-phenotyped pediatric cohort presented a major obstacle in understanding the pathophysiology of CP and its sequelae. To address this knowledge gap we have formed INSPPIRE (INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE) composed of 18 participating sites. Results from 301 pediatric patients enrolled into our study revealed a high frequency of pancreatitis-associated gene mutations and substantial disease burden in children with CP. The objective of this application is to determine the natural history of pediatric CP identify risk factors and genetic modifiers for its onset and sequelae and develop approaches to improve clinical outcomes. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that pediatric CP has unique characteristics that determine disease onset and sequelae. Our specific aims are: 1) Characterize pediatric CP determine predictors of disease severity and progression from ARP to CP; 2) Define the role of genetic mutations in early onset CP and identify disease modifiers; 3) Determine the efficacy of early pain management using cognitive-behavioral intervention on pediatric CP. Our long-term goal is to develop diagnostic modalities prognostic factors and innovative treatment approaches for pediatric ARP and CP.","Abdominal Pain;Acute;Address;Adult;Anxiety;Calcium-Sensing Receptors;Carboxypeptidase;Characteristics;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Cognitive Therapy;Control Groups;Cystic Fibrosis;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Progression;Emotional;Endocrine;Enrollment;Environmental Risk Factor;Epidemiology;Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency;Foundations;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;Genes;Genotype;Goals;Growth;Health;High Prevalence;Hospitalization;Hybrids;Impaired health;Incidence;Interdisciplinary Study;International;Internet;Knowledge;Laboratories;Manuscripts;Measures;Mental Depression;Modality;Natural History;Nutritional;Onset of illness;Outcome;Pain;Pain management;Pancreas;Pancreatitis;Phenotype;Population;Problem behavior;Procedures;Prognostic Factor;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recurrence;Registries;Research Personnel;Role;SPINK1 gene;Serine Protease;Serine Proteinase Inhibitors;Severity of illness;Site;Testing;Trypsinogen;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;acute pancreatitis;base;behavioral health;burden of illness;chronic pain;chronic pancreatitis;chymotrypsin C;clinical practice;clinically relevant;cohort;data registry;early onset;genetic risk factor;health care service utilization;health related quality of life;improved;innovation;pediatric patients;programs;prospective;repository;socioeconomics","INSPPIRE to Study Pediatric Chronic Pancreatitis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pancreatitis is an emerging but poorly understood condition in children that carries a significant socioeconomic burden.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Lung; Rare Diseases; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","Project SummaryAirway submucosal glands (SMGs) are thought to contain facultative stem cell niches for the surface airwayepithelium (SAE). In mice this niche serves only the trachea; however in larger mammals such as humanspigs and ferrets SMGs are present throughout the cartilaginous airways and may serve the broader function ofmaintaining the proximal conducting airway epithelium in the setting of disease. In cystic fibrosis (CF) defectsin human pig ferret and mouse CFTR-mediated SMG secretions lead to alterations in the expression of theneuroendocrine peptide CGRP which promotes airway progenitor cell proliferation following injury. In CF micethis pathology alters the characteristics of slowly-cycling stem cells in both the SMG and SAE nichessuggesting that glandular dysfunction in CF may impact mechanisms involved in airway repair. During theprevious five funding cycles this grant has addressed multiple aspects of airway SMG biology SMGstem/progenitor cells and CF pathogenesis. Recently our studies have focused on elucidating the Wnt-dependent mechanisms that overlap in the control of SMG development and the adult SMG stem cell niche.These studies have shown that Wnt-dependent changes in Lef-1 and Sox2 expression are key to thecommitment of primordial glandular stem cells to form SMGs. We now have evidence that Wnt-active nicheswithin adult SMGs may play an important role in regulating slowly-cycling stem cells and that conditionaldeletion or overexpression of Lef-1 influences glandular stem cell properties. Using lineage tracing we havedemonstrated that myoepithelial cells of SMGs can differentiate into both glandular and SAE cell types. Wepropose to use lineage tracing in Lef-1 and Sox2 conditional knockout and overexpressing mice to investigatehow these two transcription factors control the Wnt pathways that are critical for mobilizing SMG stem cellsfollowing airway injury. Using a BATgal Wnt-reporter transgenic line we have demonstrated that this reporterspecifically marks primordial glandular stem cells glandular niches in adult SMGs associated with residentslowly-cycling stem cells and the first cycling stem/progenitors within SMGs following injury. UsingCRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in BATgal zygotes we have converted this transgenic reporter line into aBATCreERT2 driver mouse which will enable lineage-tracing and conditional gene deletion studies of this uniqueWnt-regulated compartment. Lastly we will dissect how SMG defects in CF mice impact the stem cells thatreside in the glandular niche using lineage-tracing of glandular myoepithelial cells and Wnt-activatedprogenitors following airway injury.

"Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Prevention; Violence Research","Project Summary/AbstractThe global injury burden is disproportionately concentrated in low and middle income countries(LMIC).This project to be named ICREATE (Injury Capacity in Research in EAsTern Europe)introduces injury and violence training to the LMIC countries of Armenia Georgia and Moldovawhich are strategic global priorities due to their political and economic ties to the Middle EastRussia and Europe. Capacity for medical and public health education in these countries hasbeen growing but injury and violence is not currently addressed. Our University of Iowa trainingprogram builds on a successful decade of capacity building for injury and violence research inRomania where our partnership helped establish the Cluj School of Public Health and itsindependently-funded injury research unit. Training will be conducted in partnershipdemonstrating a successful transition in Romania from trainees to trainers. The aims of ourtraining program are to: train a critical mass of researchers from Armenia Georgia andMoldova to conduct innovative research; facilitate the transition of trainees to positions ofleadership; develop our partner institutions as sustainable centers of excellence in injuryresearch and education; and engage partners to translate research into effective preventionand treatment programs. Based on the needs of our partner countries and expertise of theproject leadership we will focus on three areas: road traffic safety; violence against women andchildren; and acute care. Our training program will prioritize long-term MPH and PhD training to build research andleadership skills focused on injury and violence prevention. Through a European UnionTEMPUS grant our partner institutions have MPH programs that allow transfer of credit. Withinthis structure we will integrate two injury and violence courses; a Global Injury and ViolenceSummer Symposium; and a mentored research project. Injury and violence training will occur atthe University of Iowa and Cluj School of Public Health.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing obesity through improved nutrition and increased physical activity is one of the goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles initiative. Reducing obesity in rural residents is especially important since they are more likely to be obese than urban residents. Indeed Iowa residents rank 33rd of 50 states in the percent of residents who are obese and half of Iowa's adults do not meet PA recommendations. Effective interventions to increase PA in rural micropolitan (<50000 residents) communities are scant since most evidence-based interventions have been tested in urban or suburban areas. In the Midwest these micropolitan communities are also ""new destination"" locations for an influx of Latino populations. The Prevention Research Center for Rural Health (PRC-RH) with a focus on obesity addresses the health challenges of residents of micropolitan and other rural communities in Iowa through a variety of Center activities and resources as well as the implementation of an intervention research project ActiveOttumwa. PRC-RH Center activities include maintenance of an infrastructure with cores focusing on community engagement communication and dissemination of PRC-RH research and best practices training of public health professionals students and community members and evaluation of PRC-RH activities. The PRC-RH has vibrant partnerships with the Iowa Department of Public Health an active Community Advisory Board with local health department and community organization representation in Ottumwa Iowa a micropolitan new destination community. The PRC-RH intervention research project Active Ottumwa focuses on increasing physical activity in Ottumwa by determining the effectiveness of a community-based PA intervention that uses a lay health advisor (LHA) approach - to implement evidence-based PA strategies. Based on the available evidence and strategies from the Community Guide the Active Ottumwa will implement activities at three levels of influence: 1) community-wide campaigns (e.g. newspaper TV and radio announcements website exposure and public health education programs; 2) behavioral and social support interventions (e.g. behavioral contracts buddy systems goal-setting to promote and support PA activities; and 3) land-use policies and access to places for PA (.e.g. working with local governmental officials and agencies and community leaders to advocate improve and create opportunities for access and use of facilities for PA). To evaluate Active Ottumwa mixed methods will be used including a community-wide survey; longitudinal follow up of a cohort of residents that will complete accelerometry physical and anthropometric measures and survey data; observational measures; key informant in-depth interviews; and project documentation. The research project and PRC-RH will address a major evidence gap in our PA knowledge by adapting intervention strategies tested in urban and suburban areas to a micropolitan new destination community in a rural state.         "," ","University of Iowa Prevention Research Center for Rural Health","Project NarrativeThe Center activities and its research focus on the issue of obesity in rural populations.

"Biotechnology; Diabetes; Genetics; Nutrition; Obesity","Project Summary / AbstractThe studies outlined in this proposal are designed to prepare the PI Dr. Kathleen Markan with the technical andintellectual expertise required to become an expert in beige adipocyte development and metabolism. SpecificallyDr. Markan will perform in vivo metabolic phenotyping studies and perform ChIP-seq analysis and functionalscreening of putative TBX1 target genes using adipocytes isolated from the novel adipocyte specific TBX1 mousemodels she has generated. Beige adipocytes display a tremendous capacity for energy expenditure and theirbiology is being actively studied as a potential means to treat human obesity meaning Dr. Markans work willprovide direct insights regarding processes that could be used to treat human obesity. With these goals inmind the following studies are proposed: 1) determine if TBX1 adipocyte expression is both sufficient andnecessary for the development of beige adipocytes by phenotyping TBX1 adipocyte-specific transgenicmice under lean and diet induced obese conditions and testing the ability of TBX1 adipocyte-specific knockoutmice to defend core body temperature during a cold challenge. This application was thoughtfully designed to allow Dr. Markan to transition her work into independence andprogress to tenure-track faculty status at the end of the award period. The work outlined above will be conductedby Dr. Markan under the supervision of her mentor Dr. Matthew Potthoff Assistant Professor of Pharmacologyand co-mentor Dr. Dale Abel Director of the F.O.E.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; HIV/AIDS; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Mental Health; Neurosciences","Despite significance advances in anti-retroviral treatments HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND)remains prevalent and can affect a broad range of everyday activities. An effective brief cognitive screen thatcould be implemented in busy HIV clinics where clinicians have limited time to provide care for patients withcomplex medical psychiatric and cognitive conditions has the potential to significantly impact patient care interms of both identifying patients who may warrant additional treatment considerations as well as the potentialto track changes in cognition over time. Unfortunately current brief cognitive screens have lacked sensitivity tothe generally mild and mild-to-moderate deficits associated with modern HAND. Phase I saw the developmentof a brief iPad-based cognitive screening tool that could be self-administered and exhibited good validity(relative to a gold-standard neuropsychological (NP) test battery) and test-retest reliability. The 4-testcombination taking only 6 minutes to complete produced very good classification accuracy with sensitivityspecificity positive and negative predictive values all approximately 80%. The aims of Phase II are to 1) enhance the technical capabilities and usability of the iPad-based cognitivescreen for both patients and clinicians 2) improve the clinical relevance of the iPad-based cognitive screeningtool and 3) establish the clinical utility of the revised tool. To accomplish these aims we will improve the existing interface by creating a revised dashboard basedupon input from senior clinicians and adapt it to present results in a user-friendly and easily interpretablemanner and add additional brief questions address mood and problems with everyday functioning. In year 1we will develop demographically-adjusted norms based upon 125 healthy adults including norms for 6- and12-month follow-up assessments in order to optimize the tool for use in monitoring patients over time. In year 2we will implement this new normed tool in HIV clinics in both San Diego and collaborating clinics in the UnitedStates. At least 150 HIV+ participants will complete the iPad measure in clinics and at a 6-month (or clinic visitapproximating that time) follow-up. A subset of these individuals (n = 100) will also provide more detailedneuropsychological data captured during a clinic or research-based evaluation. We will then assess theeffectiveness of the tool in detecting HIV-related cognitive impairments based upon a gold-standardassessment. As a result of this project we will have a fully functional validated and marketable brief screening measurefor evaluating patient cognition improving HIV patient care facilitating future studies of HAND and itstreatment and which will position Digital Artefacts in a key leadership role in the development of user- andclinician-friendly screening measures for HAND as well as potentially other neurologic conditions.","Address;Adult;Affect;Age;Anti-Retroviral Agents;Caring;Classification;Clinic;Clinic Visits;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Complex;Data;Development;Education;Effectiveness;Ethnic Origin;Evaluation;Exhibits;Feedback;Foundations;Frequencies;Future;Gender;Gold;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Individual;Leadership;Measures;Medical;Memory;Moods;Morphologic artifacts;Neurologic;Neuropsychological Tests;Participant;Patient Care;Patient Monitoring;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physicians;Positioning Attribute;Predictive Value;Provider;Research;Research Project Grants;Risk;Role;Self-Administered;Sensitivity and Specificity;Speed;Testing;Thinking;Time;United States;Visit;age effect;alternative treatment;base;brief screening;clinical application;clinically relevant;dashboard;data management;digital;follow-up;improved;interest;neuropsychological;patient subsets;performance tests;quality assurance;screening;tool;treatment strategy;usability;user-friendly","A brief iPad-based screening measure for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders","Difficulties with memory concentration and thinking speed remain common in individuals withHIV infection despite effective medical treatments.

"Aging; Bioengineering; Cancer; Prostate Cancer; Radiation Oncology; Urologic Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Among men prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer andsecond-leading cause of cancer death with over 220000 new diagnoses expected in 2015. Approximately14% of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime1. Current treatment options for prostatecancer however have sub-optimal incidences of side effects that have a significant impact on patients' qualityof life including urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction. As prostate cancer patients may live with the sideeffects of their treatment for decades there is a critical need for lower-toxicity treatment techniques with anequal or greater probability of cancer control than current techniques. Here we propose a new prostate cancertreatment technique Rotating Shield Brachytherapy (RSBT). RSBT uses a novel radiation source 153Gd.Unlike the 192Ir radiation source used in existing radiotherapy approaches 153Gd can be partially shieldedwhich enables the radiation source to emit a deliberately non-symmetric dose distribution. This effectivelydirects radiation away from sensitive healthy tissues and into tumor tissue and therefore offers severaladvantages over existing treatment techniques. Our preliminary data indicate RSBT stands to become theprostate cancer treatment with the lowest incidence of resulting sexual dysfunction gastro-intestinal andgenitourinary toxicity due to its ability to reduce urethral rectal and bladder dose relative to conventionaltreatments. We hypothesize RSBT will further enable prostate cancer dose escalation beyond conventionalmethods without increasing dose to healthy tissues thus improving metastasis-free tumor control at 10+ yearspost-treatment. RSBT may also reduce the number of treatment sessions patients need compared to currenttherapies. We have already developed concept models of several sub-components of the prostate RSBTsystem to prove each component can be successfully constructed for eventual integration into a full RSBTprototype system. Here we will demonstrate feasibility of the RSBT approach and its advantages over existingtreatments. We will develop a prototype of the needle/catheter/source capable of delivering RSBT. We willdevelop RSBT apparatus functionality to enable the control and monitoring of the positioning of single catheterwith using a simple moving template design that converts translational template motion to rotational cathetermotion. We will develop a multiple-catheter control system by integrate the previously-developed componentsinto a complete RSBT prototype and validate the complete system by dose measurement.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease","Age is a major risk factor for a wide range of human diseases such as cancer diabetesneurodegeneration and heart disease. Specifically aging is associated with high incidence of suddencardiac death (SCD) the leading cause of death in western countries. The treatment and costs associatedwith aging-related heart disease contribute to substantial personal societal and economic burdens.Resolving the contributing mechanisms of heart disease is a pressing goal of basic and translational agingresearch. In all cells including those of heart muscle the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) andautophagy/lysosome system provide proteolytic mechanisms to regulate protein turnover and degradation.The effective removal of protein aggregates and damaged mitochondria via autophagy might be crucial forthe maintenance of homeostasis in heart and cardiac function. Although reduced autophagy is associatedwith many age-related heart diseases it remains unknown whether altered autophagy with age is acontributing factor or merely a response to cardiac senescence. We have recently identified Activinsignaling a member of the TGF- superfamily as a regulator for longevity and muscle autophagy inDrosophila. Very little is known whether and how Activin signaling might influence cardiomyopathy or itsprogression with age. In order to further understand the underlying mechanisms and translate our discoveryin fly muscle to mammalian research we will investigate the role of Activin in aging fly heart andsimultaneously in homologous cardiomyocytes of a rabbit model of heart aging. Specifically we will identifythe molecular mechanisms through which Activin signaling controls autophagy using Drosophila cell culture(Aim 1). We will then determine how Activin signaling modulates myocardial cell autophagy and heartfunction of aging Drosophila (Aim 2). Finally we will translate our discovery in fly to mammalian cardiacsystem by dissecting the regulation of autophagy and tissue homeostasis by Activin signaling in aging rabbitcardiomyocytes (Aim 3). A better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance ofheart tissue homeostasis will be critical for the development of therapeutic strategies for preventing cardiacdysfunction during aging. This Pathway to Independence award will help Dr. Hua Bai to achieve his careergoal in many ways and help his transition to an independent investigator. Dr. Bais long-term career goal isto establish an independent program at a major research university or biomedical research institute wherehe will lead and teach basic research on functional aging and age-related diseases with an emphasis onautophagy and its roles in cardiac aging. During the K99 training phase Dr. Bai will build his owntranslational expertise by simultaneously learning experimental systems of cardiac aging with Drosophilaand the rabbit heart (an exceptional human model). While he will continue to be mentored by Dr. Marc TatarDr. Bai will train with Dr. Gideon Koren Director of Cardiovascular Research Center (CVRC) of RhodeIsland Hospital and Dr. Rolf Bodmer Director of Development and Aging Program at Sanford BurnhamMedical Research Institute. Both Dr. Koren and Dr. Bodmer are the experts in the field of cardiac aging anddiseases.

"Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","Project Summary/AbstractEpilepsy is a common and disabling disease for which current treatments remain inadequate. Epilepsy isknown to have a major genetic contribution but a small proportion of epilepsy overall is explained by knowngenes and mechanisms. Thus there is a critical need to identify the molecules and pathways that underlieepilepsy pathophysiology and to find novel therapeutic strategies. Focusing on pathways which lead toepilepsy-related phenotypes in diverse species and model systems may help accelerate the discovery process.Recently we found mutations in the Prickle genes can contribute to seizures in multiple species ranging fromflies to humans. This system can provide a basis for the development of safer and more effective drugregimens for treating epilepsy. Our preliminary findings led us to the hypothesis that mutations in thePRICKLE pathway are associated with epilepsy and that Prickle-modulating reagents can be used to treatepilepsy or seizures. The objective of this R01 application is to identify the molecules involved in Pricklesignaling and to determine whether Prickle pathway-modulating reagents alleviate seizures in our multiplemodel systems. The studies proposed here should both further our understanding of the biology of thePrickles and their connection to epilepsy and lead to new therapeutic modalities. Our specific aims are: to 1)Test Prickle-pathway molecules as anti-epilepsy drug targets and 2) Test Wnt5a and related moleculesas anti-epileptics in Prickle mutant mice. These experiments should provide insight into the biology ofPrickle signaling how it and whether Prickle-modulating reagents offer new epilepsy treatments.","Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Antiepileptic Agents;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Biology;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Polarity;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complex;Data;Defect;Development;Diagnosis;Drosophila genus;Drug Targeting;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiology (science);Epilepsy;Etiology;Fishes;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;General Population;Genes;Genetic;Genetic screening method;Genomics;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Kinesin;Knock-out;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Ligands;Link;Maps;Mediating;Methods;Modality;Molecular;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Neurons;Organism;Orthologous Gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Plant Roots;Process;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;Reagent;Regimen;Research;Role;Seizures;Signal Transduction;Slice;System;Testing;Tissues;Translating;Work;Zebrafish;abstracting;base;disabling disease;drug discovery;fly;insight;meetings;member;mutant;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;planar cell polarity;research study;small molecule;therapeutic target;ubiquitin isopeptidase","Exploring Novel Epilepsy Pathways","Project Narrative/Relevant to Public HealthEpilepsy is a disabling disease that affects ~1% of the general population and requires long-term treatment.Most forms of epilepsy are inheritable but for over 70% of patients the underlying genetic basis for theircondition remains unknown impeding effective diagnosis and treatment.

Amyloid  (A) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles made up of hyperphosphorylated Tau are the twohallmark features of AD. Although no mutation in the Tau gene has been identified to cause AD FTDP-17 canbe caused by the P301L mutation. Fyn a Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SFK) has recently beenimplicated in AD. A activates Fyn to cause behavioral deficits Tau hyperphosphorylation and downregulationof N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) at the synapse. Previously our laboratory discovered that wildtype Tau (TauWT) upregulates Fyn activity and mutant Tau (TauP301L) has increased affinity for Fyn. Missingfrom our current knowledge is the role of the Fyn-Tau interaction in both normal physiological functions and inFTDP-17 where A is absent. This proposal is based on our hypothesis that during disease pathogenesis aninteraction between Tau and Fyn serves as a key event leading to neurodegeneration. To investigate the role of the Fyn-Tau interaction in both normal functions and neurodegeneration wewill first create a Fyn-/-/Tau-/- mouse and then induce Tau pathology by injecting Adeno-associated virus (AAV)expressing TauP301L (AAV TauP301L) into the ventricles of the double knockout mouse on postnatal day 0 (p0).We propose the following specific aims:1) Characterize behavioral and biochemical properties of Fyn-/-/Tau-/- mice. We will perform various behavioraland biochemical assays starting with areas where single knockout animals display deficits in order to identifypathways that are affected by both Fyn and Tau. Fyn-/- Tau-/- and WT mice will be used as controls. Theresults obtained from this aim will also serve as a control for experiments in specific aim 2.2) Determine how Fyn depletion affects TauP301L induced neurodegeneration in an FTDP-17 mouse model. Wewill create Fyn-/-/Tau-/-(AAV TauP301L) animals and use behavioral biochemical and immunohistochemicalassays to compare the properties of this mouse against those of Tau-/-(AAV TauP301L) animals. Fyn-/-/Tau-/-(AAVTauWT) Tau-/-(AAV TauWT) Fyn-/-/Tau-/- and Tau-/- will be used as controls. Our proposal will investigate the interaction between Fyn and Tau during both normal neuronal functionand during the neurodegenerative process in an FTDP-17 mouse model.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Injury - Trauma - (Head and Spine); Neurosciences; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","PROJECT SUMMARYOcular surface injury is second only to cataracts as the most common cause of visual impairment worldwide.Chemical exposure is a frequent route of ocular surface injury and both acid and alkali burns of the cornea areconsidered ophthalmologic emergencies. However alkali burns present more frequently and often pose agreater threat to sight due to the rapidity by which damage occurs after exposure.Healing of corneal epithelial injury occurs through cooperation between corneal stem cells called limbalepithelial stem cells (LESCs) and the terminations of trigeminal neurons called corneal nerves that denselyinnervate the cornea. LESCs are responsible for generating new epithelial cells to replace those lost to injurywhile corneal nerves contribute to maintenance of corneal avascularity number and function of LESCs anddifferentiation of postmitotic corneal epithelial cells. When injury prevents rapid and efficient repair of thecornea vision can be compromised or permanently lost due to abnormal epithelial growth and scarring.Standard clinical approaches to corneal injury focus on minimizing inflammation or restoring a stable tear filmto promote corneal reepithelialization with less attention paid to corneal reinnervation. This project aims toascertain the therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of a pair of novel pharmacologic agents in the corneafollowing alkali burn with the goal of informing improved strategies for managing corneal injury. Our agent (-)-P7C3-S243 has demonstrated potent neuroprotective effects in both peripheral and central nervous systemsfollowing injury while P18C8 has demonstrated mitogenic efficacy. We hypothesize that (-)-P7C3-S243 andP18C8 will target the corneal nerves and epithelial cells respectively to accelerate recovery following alkalicorneal injury. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims:1) Determine whether coadministration of (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 accelerates wound healing in a mousemodel of chemical corneal injury. We will model alkali-induced corneal injury in mice through application ofsodium hydroxide to the ocular surface and evaluate both acute and chronic phases of corneal wound healing.2) Determine the effects of (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 on cultured corneal epithelial and trigeminal neurons.The focus of this aim will be on corneal nerves and corneal epithelial cells the hypothesized targets of (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 respectively. We will model axonal and epithelial injury in cultured mouse trigeminalneurons and corneal epithelial cells.At the conclusion of this project we will have characterized the therapeutic efficacy of two novel pharmacologicagents in a model of alkali-induced corneal injury and established a foundation on which to advancemechanistic work for these agents. This research is thus positioned to advance current clinical practiceparadigms by laying the groundwork for advancing new approaches to corneal injury thereby supporting themission of the National Eye Institute.","Acids;Acute;Adhesions;Adult;Affect;Alkalies;Alternative Therapies;Anatomy;Animals;Anterior;Area;Attention;Axotomy;Bilateral;Biological Assay;Blindness;Burn injury;Cataract;Cell Death;Cells;Chemical Exposure;Chemical Models;Chemicals;Chronic;Chronic Phase;Cicatrix;Clinical;Clinical Management;Complementary therapies;Cornea;Corneal Injury;Defect;Development;Ectoderm;Emergency Situation;Environment;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Eye;Film;Foundations;Goals;Growth;Healed;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Injury;Invaded;Investigational Drugs;Light;Maintenance;Measures;Mission;Mitotic;Modeling;Mus;Names;National Eye Institute;Natural regeneration;Nerve;Nerve Degeneration;Nerve Regeneration;Neuraxis;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Neuroprotective Agents;Newborn Infant;Operative Surgical Procedures;Optical Coherence Tomography;Peripheral;Peripheral Blood Stem Cell;Positioning Attribute;Procedures;Process;Recovery;Recovery of Function;Research;Route;Sclera;Shapes;Sodium Hydroxide;Stem cell transplant;Stem cells;Stimulation of Cell Proliferation;Stratification;Structure;Structure of trigeminal ganglion;Surface;Testing;Tissues;Trauma;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment Protocols;Trigeminal System;Vision;Visual Acuity;Visual impairment;Work;Wound Healing;axon regeneration;base;cellular targeting;chemical elimination;clinical practice;corneal epithelium;corneal repair;daughter cell;healing;improved;in vivo;limbal;mouse model;nerve stem cell;neural precursor cell;neurogenesis;neuron loss;neuroprotection;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;ocular surface;postnatal;pre-clinical;prevent;regenerative;reinnervation;relating to nervous system;repaired;standard care;stem cell differentiation","Therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of (-)-P7C3-S243 and P18C8 coadministration in a model of chemical corneal injury","PROJECT NARRATIVECovered by a thin film of protective cells the cornea is a transparent dome-shaped structure that focusesincoming light and maintains a physical barrier against infection and injury to the eye.

"Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","Project Summary/AbstractObesity is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality partly through the development ofhigh blood pressure (hypertension). However the molecular basis for the relationship between obesity andhypertension remains ill defined. Aberrant leptin action and leptin receptor (LepR) signaling has emerged as animportant mechanism underlying obesity-associated hypertension. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormoneinvolved in the regulation of energy homeostasis through its action in the brain to suppress food intake andincrease energy expenditure. Additionally leptin has been implicated in the control of blood pressure viaregulation of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) with pathophysiological implications in obesity-inducedhypertension.In the brain the LepR is known to activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways which are differentiallyinvolved in mediating the various physiological effects of leptin. Of note mammalian target of rapamycincomplex 1 (mTORC1 composed of multiple subunits including raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)has emerged as a key molecular hub underlying the pressor and sympathetic actions of leptin. However thespecific neuronal population(s) in which mTORC1 mediates these effects of leptin are not known. Mypreliminary data and published work suggest that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are critically involvedin mediating the renal sympathoexcitatory and hypertensive effects of leptin pointing to these neurons as apotential candidate for the locus of mTORC1-mediated pressor and sympathetic actions of leptin. Thus Ihypothesize that mTORC1 signaling in POMC neurons mediates the effects of leptin on blood pressure andSNA. To test this hypothesis I developed a genetically modified mouse model in which raptor a critical subunitof mTORC1 is conditionally deleted in POMC neurons (POMCCrexRaptorfl/fl mice). I will perform a series ofexperiments to characterize the blood pressure and regional SNA responses to leptin in these mice to definethe role of mTORC1 in POMC neurons in mediating these processes.","Adipocytes;Blood Pressure;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Complex;Data;Development;Diet;Eating;Energy Metabolism;Event;FRAP1 gene;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Health;Homeostasis;Hormones;Hypertension;Kidney;Knock-out;Leptin;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Nerve;Neurons;Obesity;Physiological;Population;Pro-Opiomelanocortin;Process;Publishing;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Research;Role;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Testing;Work;abstracting;base;blood pressure regulation;hemodynamics;leptin receptor;mTOR protein;mortality;mouse model;pressure;prevent;receptor;research study;response","mTORC1 in POMC Neurons as a Mediator of the Hemodynamic and Sympathetic Effects of Leptin","Project NarrativeObesity-associated high blood pressure (hypertension) is a major national health concern because it promotescardiovascular disease.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness","Project Summary Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of schizophrenia that often precedes formal diagnosis andcontinues throughout disease progression. It is one of the chief factors in determining quality of life for manypatients and remains difficult to treat. The underlying basis of cognitive dysfunction is unknown. The prefrontalcortex (PFC) and striatum are involved in cognition and are consistently dysfunctional in schizophrenia.However their respective roles are incompletely understood. This proposal approaches this knowledge gapwith a combination of behavioral neurophysiological and optogenetic techniques. We will study in detail howprefrontal and striatal regions interact during elementary cognitive operations. In Aim 1 we will implant multielectrode arrays in both the PFC and striatum in rats. We will record theactivity of neuronal ensembles in each region during an interval-timing task which draws on the same neuralsubstrates as working memory tasks. This approach will give us information about the simultaneousprocessing in these two structures and will identify patterns of neuronal activity that underlie elementarycognition. In Aim 2 we will elucidate the relationship between the PFC and striatum during elementarycognition. We will employ optogenetics to specifically modulate frontostriatal circuits. First we will inhibitprefrontal projections to the striatum with ArchT while recording striatal activity during interval timing. Secondwe will stimulate frontostriatal projections with ChR2 while recording striatal activity during timing behavior. These experiments will determine the role of frontostriatal circuits in elementary cognitive processing.This information could suggest possible therapeutic targets and strategies for alleviating the currentlyuntreatable cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric diseases.","Address;Area;Attention;Behavior;Behavioral;Behavioral Assay;Brain;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Corpus striatum structure;Correlation Studies;Data;Decision Making;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Progression;Dorsal;Electrophysiology (science);Functional disorder;Goals;Human;Impaired cognition;Implant;Knowledge;Linear Regressions;Medial;Mental disorders;Motor;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurons;Patients;Prefrontal Cortex;Presynaptic Terminals;Process;Proteins;Quality of life;Ramp;Rattus;Regression Analysis;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Structure;Symptoms;Techniques;Time;Work;base;cognitive process;cognitive task;executive function;multi-electrode arrays;neuronal patterning;neurophysiology;neuropsychiatric disorder;novel;novel therapeutics;operation;optogenetics;relating to nervous system;research study;response;therapeutic target;time interval","Prefrontal control of striatal neuronal ensembles during elementary cognition: Implications for schizophrenia","Project Narrative Cognitive dysfunction is a devastating and currently untreatable symptom of schizophrenia and remainspoorly understood.

"Bioengineering; Nanotechnology; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYThe steady growth of products containing engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) has outpaced research todetermine their impact on biological systems most importantly human health. Our goal in this NanomaterialsHealth Implications Research (NHIR) Consortium proposal is to elucidate how physicochemical properties ofENMs and their molecular interactions affect the immune and hormonal status of exposed animals. We willaccomplish this goal by collaborating with NIEHS project scientists and NHIR Consortium members to testENMs provided by the ENM Resource and Coordination Core (ERCC) first in vitro using a novel air-liquidinterface system and then in vivo for a subset of ENMs using a Pulmonary Tox Protocol and a DevelopmentalTox Protocol. Each protocol will employ nose-only and whole-body inhalation exposure and a host of outcomemeasures to assess body condition cytotoxicity inflammation oxidative stress gene expression immunemodulation endocrine disruption and histopathology. We will share our data and methods within the NHIRConsortium and beyond thereby contributing to the development of comprehensive biological responseprofiles of selected ENMs and identifying those that pose significant hazards for vulnerable populationsincluding pregnant women and children. Three specific aims will be addressed: AIM 1: Identify which ERCC-characterized ENMs are most likely to induce cytotoxicity inflammation or immunomodulation in airwayepithelial cells using our established in vitro air-liquid interface model system. AIM2: Characterizecomprehensive biological responses to selected ENMs following subchronic inhalation exposure in pregnantcompared to non-pregnant mice. AIM 3: Elucidate biological response profiles in male and female offspringfollowing exposure to ENMs in utero and then postnatally by inhalation and lactation. These aims will beaccomplished by an experienced research team with expertise in inhalation toxicology of nanomaterialsdevelopmental toxicology nanoaerosol generation and characterization and ENM proteomics. Five primaryhypotheses will be tested: H1) Inhalation of the ENM under study induces significant biological responses atthe selected dose compared with controls. H2) ENM exposure produces adverse effects with a distinctbiological response profile that is dependent on pregnancy status. H3) Maternal ENM inhalation exposure frompre-conception to delivery produces adverse developmental responses in fetuses. H4) Pups with further post-natal exposure develop toxicological responses not seen in sham-exposed controls or in ENM-exposed adults.H5) Following in utero and post-natal ENM exposure maturation without exposure is associated with diseaseprogression. The research proposed herein will significantly advance understanding of the dose-specifictoxicity of inhaled ENMs and the operative AOPs and thus will establish a framework for improving the safetyprofile of commercial ENMs and guide their safe and sustainable use.","Address;Adult;Adult Children;Adverse effects;Affect;Air;Animals;Area;Binding;Biological;Biological Models;Birth;Breathing;Cell Line;Cell Survival;Cell physiology;Child;Collaborations;Conceptions;Consultations;Copper;Couples;Data;Development;Disease Progression;Dose;Embryo;Endocrine;Endocrine disruption;Engineering;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Equilibrium;Exposure to;Female;Fetus;Gene Expression;Generations;Genes;Goals;Growth;Health;Histopathology;Hormonal;Human;Immune;Immune Response Genes;Immune Tolerance;Immune system;Immunocompetence;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Inhalation Exposure;Inhalation Toxicology;Lactation;Life;Liquid substance;Lung;Manufactured Materials;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;Natural immunosuppression;Nose;Organ;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Oxidative Stress;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Perinatal;Perinatal Exposure;Pregnancy;Pregnant Women;Production;Property;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research;Resources;Route;Safety;Scientist;Serum;Signal Pathway;Spleen;Surface;System;Testing;Toxic effect;Up-Regulation;Vulnerable Populations;Weaning;Work;adverse outcome;aged;base;biological adaptation to stress;biological systems;body system;chemokine;consumer product;cytokine;cytotoxicity;developmental toxicology;embryo/fetus antigen;experience;exposed human population;fetal;gene repression;hazard;immunoregulation;immunotoxicity;improved;in utero;in vivo;in vivo Model;innovation;insight;male;member;nanomaterials;nanoparticle;novel;offspring;postnatal;pregnant;prenatal;programs;pup;response;screening;sharing data","Biological Response Profiles of Selected Engineered Nanomaterials after Perinatal Exposure","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe primary goal of this project is to conduct innovative research to elucidate biological response profilesassociated with inhalation of commercially important engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) after perinatalexposure.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Diagnostic Radiology; Networking and Information Technology R&D; Radiation Oncology","ABSTRACTThe integrated Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET-CT) has become anindispensable tool in modern cancer therapy. Accurate target delineation is an inevitable first steptowards fully making use of the potentials of PET-CT. However in current clinical practice thisimportant task is typically performed visually on a slice-by-slice basis with very limited support ofautomated segmentation tools. The state-of-the-art PET-CT segmentation techniques rely on either asingle modality or the fused PET-CT data which may not fully take advantage of both modalities thuscompromising the segmentation accuracy. In addition the state-of-the-art therapeutic responseprediction methods highly rely on the handcrafted image features and parameters which poses alimiting factor for their wide use in clinic. This research proposes to develop fast and objective PET-CTanalysis methods to facilitate the utilization of the dual modality imaging for both large-scale clinicaltrial research and daily clinical care. The novel feature of the proposed methods is the first time tointroduce co-segmentation for PET-CT tumor delineation which recognizes the contour difference oftumors in PET from those in CT. New PET-CT specific priors will be explored and incorporated intothe segmentation framework further improving the accuracy of segmentation. The proposedresponse prediction method is built on the accurate tumor definition from our PET-CT co-segmentation approach with an innovative design of a convolutional neural network for automaticallylearning hierarchical features directly from the PET-CT scans leading to highly accurate prediction ofresponse. The developed methods will be tested in comparison with state-of-the-art methods utilizedtoday. The performance of the methods will be statistically assessed in data samples of sufficientsizes.","Address;Algorithms;Automobile Driving;Binding;Biological Neural Networks;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Data;Dependence;Development;Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging;Evaluation;Excision;Graph;Hand;Health;Heterogeneity;Image;Image Analysis;Image Reconstructions;Individual;Informatics;Inherited;Intraobserver Variability;Learning;Manuals;Medical;Methodology;Methods;Modality;NIH Program Announcements;Nature;Outcome;PET/CT scan;Pathology;Performance;Physics;Physiological;Physiology;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prediction of Response to Therapy;Predictive Value;Protocols documentation;Radiation Oncology;Radiation therapy;Reporting;Research;Sampling;Scanning;Scheme;Slice;Source;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tomography Computed Scanners;Tumor Volume;Tumor stage;Uncertainty;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;anticancer research;base;cancer radiation therapy;cancer therapy;clinical care;clinical practice;design;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;image processing;image registration;imaging Segmentation;imaging modality;improved;improved outcome;innovation;novel;outcome forecast;predicting response;prognostic;prognostic value;radiation response;response;tool;treatment planning;treatment response;tumor;uptake;usability","Developing Enabling PET-CT Image Analysis Tools for Predicting Response in Radiation Cancer Therapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCEThis study addresses important problems of PET-CT image segmentation and therapeuticresponse prediction that are vital to many applications of PET-CT in modern cancer therapy.The methods developed in this project will greatly accelerate the pace of PET-CT imageprocessing and thus help fulfill the compelling clinical needs of analyzing a large amount ofvolumetric PET-CT data potentially improving clinical outcome.","NCI","9185750","9/6/2016","PAR-15-334","1R21CA209874-01","1","R21","CA","209874","01","","ZHANG, YANTIAN ","9/6/2016","7/31/2018","Special Emphasis Panel[ZCA1 TCRB-W (M2)]"," ","8438058","WU, XIAODONG ","Not Applicable","01","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/6/2016","7/31/2017"," ","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","165844"," ","NCI","108750","57094"," ","165844",

"Contraception/Reproduction; Endocrine Disruptors; Estrogen; Infertility","7. Project summary:Approximately 11% of U.S. females suffer from infertility often without any clear cause. At birth females areborn with an irreplaceable pool of oocytes the female gamete. Chemical exposures that target the ovary candeplete and/or damage this oocyte pool which is manifested physiologically as infertility and accelerated entryinto the menopausal state. The post-menopausal years are associated with a number of deleterious healthissues thus a longer time spent in this physiological state increases a womans chance to develop such healthcomplications. In addition to follicle depletion some chemical exposures cause infertility by impacting ovarianhormone production.Glyphosate (GLY) is a widely used herbicide in rural and urban environments and annual use comprises 155million lbs. In cell lines GLY reduces expression of STAR and CYP19A critical enzymes in ovarian 17-estradiol synthesis. In our preliminary experiments we have discovered that GLY exposure in vivo reducesSTAR and CYP19A and increases phosphorylation of AKT (pAKT) a key ovarian regulatory molecule. Thesealterations translate into potential impacts of GLY on female gamete and sex steroid hormone production. Inaim 1 we will determine the contribution of increased pAKT on folliculogenesis using an ex vivo and in vivoapproach. Aim 2 will investigate a phenotypic effect of reduced STAR and CYP19A on 17-estradiol levelsovarian cyclicity and fertility outcomes in female mice. Both aims will characterize a time- and dose-dependentresponse to GLY exposure. Completion of these aims will thoroughly interrogate our central hypothesis thatGLY alters ovarian PI3K signaling leading to increased pAKT but reduced STAR and CYP19a withconcomitant impacts on folliculogenesis 17-estradiol synthesis and fertility in female mice and a temporalmechanistic map of events that occur upon GLY exposure which could translate into compromised femalefertility will be constructed. Using the generated knowledge consideration of GLY as a female reproductivetoxicant will be possible. Additionally identification of GLY targets within the ovary that compromise femalefertility will be completed.","1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Address;Affect;Aromatase;Birth;Cell Line;Chemical Exposure;Cholesterol;Classification;Cytochrome P450;Data;Dermal;Development;Dose;Endocrine Disruptors;Endocrine disruption;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Enzymes;Estradiol;Estrogen Receptor beta;Estrus;Event;Exposure to;Female;Fertility;Foundations;Gametogenesis;Genetic Transcription;Germ Cells;Glean;Goals;Gonadal Steroid Hormones;Growing Follicle;Health;Herbicides;In Vitro;Infertility;Ingestion;Knowledge;Maintenance;Maps;Measurement;Mediating;Menopause;Messenger RNA;Methods;Molecular Target;Monitor;Mus;Oocytes;Oral;Outcome;Ovarian;Ovarian hormone;Ovary;Partner in relationship;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Periodicity;Phosphorylation;Physiological;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Postmenopause;Pregnancy Outcome;Primordial Follicle;Process;Production;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Proxy;Reproduction;Reproductive Health;Rural;Side;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Staining method;Stains;Steroid biosynthesis;Time;Translating;Woman;base;folliculogenesis;glyphosate;in vivo;male;meetings;novel;ovotoxicity;postnatal;reproductive;reproductive function;research study;response;steroidogenic acute regulatory protein;toxicant","Investigating modes of action of glyphosate-induced ovotoxicity","8.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a mosquito-borne Neglected Tropical Disease caused by filarial worms includingBrugia malayi; over 120 million people worldwide are infected with over 1.4 billion at risk in 70 endemiccountries. Current control strategies employing mass drug administration have reduced prevalence in manyareas but LF remains a significant global health concern. There is a recognized need for new strategies tocontrol LF and other diseases caused by parasitic nematodes. This project focuses on the host-parasiteinterface during parasite infection development and persistence of LF and represents an exciting new directionfor investigating this field. We propose a novel mechanism by which B. malayi modulates the host immunesystem through small regulatory RNAs and proteins delivered via a specific type of extracellular vesicle calledexosomes. Our preliminary data demonstrate that infective stage larvae of B. malayi secrete exosomes thatthese exosomes contain a diverse miRNA and protein cargo and that distinct parasite miRNA potentially targethost genes. Further these exosomes are internalized by host macrophages and elicit a specific modulatoryphenotype. The overall goals of this proposal are to define the cargo of parasite exosomes secreted across theintra-mammalian Brugia life cycle and probe the mechanistic basis for their bioactivity.In Specific Aim 1 we propose to profile the small RNA and protein cargo of secreted exosomes across theintra-mammalian B. malayi life cycle using a combination of small RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-Seq) andproteomic profiling to identify the molecular mediators of host manipulation delivered by parasite exosomes. InSpecific Aim 2 we will define the mechanisms of exosome bioactivity on cellular mediators of the host immuneresponse. We will examine uptake of parasite exosomes by host macrophages to reveal how these vesiclesare internalized by host cells then leverage the genetic capacity of the murine model by using genetic knockouts to generate mechanistic insight into the modulatory phenotype elicited in host macrophages by exosomeinternalization.The long-term impact of the project will be new knowledge of B. malayi biology and the exposure of newmolecules that may be exploited in novel LF control strategies. Further the mechanisms we describe here maybe conserved across animal human and plant parasitic nematodes and could be utilized for broad-spectrumcontrol applications.","Animals;Anthelmintics;Area;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biology;Bone Marrow;Brugia;Brugia malayi;C57BL/6 Mouse;Cells;Country;Culicidae;Culture Media;Data;Development;Disease;Equilibrium;Filarial Elephantiases;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Health;Host-Parasite Relations;Human;Immune response;Immune system;Infection;Intervention;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Larva;Life;Life Cycle Stages;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;MicroRNAs;Molecular;Mouse Strains;Mus;Nematoda;Nematode infections;Parasite Control;Parasites;Parasitic nematode;Pathway interactions;Phagocytosis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Plants;Prevalence;Proteins;Proteomics;RNA;Risk;Small RNA;Staging;Structure;Toll-Like Receptor Pathway;Vesicle;base;chemotherapy;deep sequencing;exosome;experience;extracellular vesicles;global health;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;macrophage;mouse model;neglected tropical diseases;novel;novel strategies;prevent;programs;research study;skills;transcriptome sequencing;uptake","Exploring the Structure and Function of Parasitic Nematode Exosomes","This project will significantly advance our understanding of how parasitic nematodes manipulate their hostduring parasitic nematode infection.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Pediatric","Project Summary All typically developing infants develop language yet significant disparities exist across infants ofdifferent backgrounds in vocabulary growth starting as early as infants' first year. Prior research hasdocumented the importance of input and caregiver-infant social interactions for language development;however the specific mechanisms that support developmental change are unclear. One clearly establishedfinding is that caregiver responsiveness has effects on language outcomes. Specifically sensitiveresponsiveness (i.e. following in to infants' attentional focus) facilitates development whereas redirectiveresponsiveness negatively impacts development; however a recent study found that redirective responseswere positively associated with language development if the response was successful in re-orienting infants'attention. Thus it needs to be determined how infants' attentional behavior changes in the moment inresponse to different caregiver response styles and relate these immediate effects to word learning andlanguage outcomes. Therefore the long-term objective of the study is to uncover processes underlyingthe association between caregiver responses and language development which is important to identifypossible interventions that can support robust language development in all infants. The specific aims ofthis study are to: 1) determine real-time changes in infant visual attention as a result of mothers' and fathers'interactive and response styles; and 2) link infant visual attention during social interactions to word learningand language development. This study will evaluate whether visual attention mediates the associationbetween caregiver responses and language outcomes. For Specific Aim 1 the study will make use of novel technology head-mounted eye-trackers.Caregivers and infants will engage in freeplay interactions in the lab while infants are wearing a head-mounted eye-tracker. Experimental manipulation of parents' responses to infant vocal and nonvocalexploratory behavior will elucidate the effects of sensitive vs. redirective responses on infants' real-timevisual attention when infants are 10 months of age. For Specific Aim 2 word learning and language will beassessed at 14 and 18 months of age. The relationship between response types infant visual attention andvocabulary will be explored. An important outcome of the research linking caregivers' responsiveness andinfants' visual attention to variation in vocabulary growth will contribute to understanding individualdifferences in language development.

"Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryClostridium difficile the most common cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea is responsible for250000 infections and 14000 deaths each year in the United States alone. Much of the pathologyassociated with C. difficile infections is caused by two major toxins TcdA and TcdB. Multiple studieshave demonstrated the critical role TcdA and TcdB play in causing C. difficile infections. Previous studieshave established that expression of the toxins is induced in response to nutrient limitation. Moreoverseveral factors that mediate this response have been identified including an alternative sigma factor(TcdR) a global regulator that responds to GTP and branched chain amino acids (CodY) and a globalregulator that responds to easily metabolized carbon sources like glucose (CcpA). Here we describethe use of single cell analysis to monitor expression of the toxin genes in C. difficile. We fused the genefor a red fluorescent protein (RFP) to the promoter for toxin A which allowed us to monitor toxin expres-sion in single cells by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Surprisingly tcdA-rfp expressionappears to be bistable. In stationary phase when toxin expression is highest about 30% of the cellsare TcdA-ON and the mean fluorescence intensity of these cells is ~50 fold higher than in the TcdA-OFF population. We find that bistability is dependent upon the levels of TcdR. These findings raiseseveral important questions: How is bistability controlled? Are other genes regulated in a bistable man-ner? What is the biological significance of this phenotypic diversity? Here we propose to address thefirst two questions by (a) testing the hypothesis that bistable expression of toxin production is mediatedby global regulators of gene expression controlling levels of TcdR and (b) identifying genes co-regulatedwith tcdA. Achieving the aims of this proposal will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms bywhich toxin gene expression is controlled in C. difficile at the level of the single cell.

As the number of dental implants placed per year worldwide increases thefrequency of implant-related infections is also on the rise. Peri-implantitis is responsible for asignificant number of delayed implant failures and ultimately for the costly replacement ofimplant-supported prostheses. It is associated with a combination of bone loss and biofilmformation. Since bacterial etiologic agents are also associated with numerous implant-relatedinfections prevention of biofilm formation has become a global health priority. We propose todevelop novel antimicrobial coatings capable of preventing biofilm formation by releasing bothon demand and in situ highly active platinum-doped silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). This noveldesign will build upon highly reactive Pt-doped AgNPs encapsulated in pH-responsiveamorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) carriers capable of enhanced release of silver ions bygalvanic reaction when the pH becomes acidic as-triggered by infection. Our preliminary datademonstrates that we can successfully synthesize Pt-doped AgNPs and encapsulate them intobiosoluble ACP carriers. The final outcome will provide in situ antimicrobial coatings activatedsolely by infection-triggered acidosis. The associated byproducts are biosoluble and bioactiveand could favor osseointegration. The project will initiate with the synthesis of Pt-doped AgNPs(Aim 1) followed by the refinement of the encapsulation process with ACP carriers (Aim 2) andfinally assessment of silver release profiles biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of dopedand undoped encapsulated AgNPs as well as coated CP-titanium discs (Aim3).

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Peripheral Neuropathy; Prevention","Chemotherapy is frequently accompanied by peripheral neuropathies so painful and debilitating that it may benecessary to reduce the dose of agent delay one or more cycles of chemotherapy or even cease treatment.Furthermore the peripheral neuropathies can worsen after treatment has ended and may not resolve withtime. Both the dose-limiting nature and the persistence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies(CIPN) are significant health care problems. There are few - if any - evidence-based therapies for the relief ofCIPN. The long term goal of this research team is to identify a new strategy to alleviated CIPN in cancerpatients resulting in a meaningful improvement in their quality of life and the ability to sustain better andlonger treatment. Here we propose a phase II clinical trial of the efficacy of nicotinamide riboside (NR) anaturally occurring vitamin precursor of NAD+ as a therapeutic agent. This proposal is based on thehypothesis that paclitaxel injures primary afferent neurons by reducing NAD+ in these neurons and theirfibers. Our preclinical data demonstrate that paclitaxel does indeed decrease levels of NAD+ in dorsal rootganglia and that NR protects neuronal NAD+ in the face of intense chemotherapy treatment. Moreover pre-treatment with NR protects against and post-treatment with NR reverses the mechanical hypersensitivityand the aversive dimension of pain in a rodent model of CIPN induced by paclitaxel. The specific aim of thisproposal is to evaluate if daily dosing of NR prevents progressive worsening of sensory neuropathy inpatients undergoing adjuvant or neo-adjuvant therapy with paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the treatment ofstage 1-3 breast cancer. The primary outcome measure is the change in the grade of sensory neuropathybetween the baseline assessment and the 8th day of NR treatment after the final (i.e.12th) taxane infusion asdetermined by the CTCAE questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures are incidence of dose reductionactual vs planned cumulative dose of paclitaxel administered percentage of patients with dose reduction andpatient-reported function. This trial will be an open-label study in which all patients receive NR. Comparisonswill be made to historical data on severity and progression in this population. Additional analyses will confirmthat NR increases levels of NAD+ or its metabolite NAAD in blood and does not interfere with the pharmaco-kinetics of paclitaxel. This phase II clinical trial will provide preliminary data as to whether NR treatmentprevents a progressive worsening of CIPN and enables patients to complete the chemotherapy treatmentwithout a reduction in dose of paclitaxel. It will also generate preliminary data correlating efficacy to anincrease in NAD+ levels. This work will drive large Phase III studies of NR in the treatment of CIPN and thediscovery of a new pharmacotherapy for a significant unmet need in oncology. The findings have greatpotential to transform the practice of oncology with a therapy that results in a meaningful improvement in thepatient's quality of life and the ability to complete optimal chemotherapy treatment regimens.","Address;Adjuvant;Adjuvant Therapy;Afferent Neurons;Aftercare;Blood;Breast Cancer Patient;Cancer Patient;Cancer Survivor;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy;Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events;Data;Development;Dimensions;Dose;Dose-Limiting;Drug Kinetics;Evidence based treatment;Fiber;Goals;Gynecologic Oncology Group;Health;Healthcare;Hypersensitivity;Incidence;Infusion procedures;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Mechanics;Monitor;NADP;Nature;Neurons;Oncologist;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Paclitaxel;Pain;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmacotherapy;Phase II Clinical Trials;Phase III Clinical Trials;Plasma;Population;Probability;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Reporting;Research;Rodent Model;Severities;Spinal Ganglia;Staging;Statistical Data Interpretation;Therapeutic Agents;Time;Treatment Protocols;Vitamins;Work;base;cancer diagnosis;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;design;evidence base;improved functioning;injured;malignant breast neoplasm;neurotoxicity;nicotinamide-beta-riboside;oncology;open label;phase 3 study;phase II trial;pre-clinical;prevent;primary outcome;secondary outcome;sensory neuropathy;taxane;tool","Phase II Trial of Nicotinamide Riboside for Relief of Taxane-Induced Sensory Neuropathy","HEALTH RELEVANCECurrently there are no evidence-based therapies for the relief of chemotherapy-induced peripheralneuropathies (CIPN) which may be so debilitating that it becomes necessary to reduce the dose of agentdelay one or more cycles of cancer treatment or even cease treatment.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Embryonic - Human","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACTWhile RNA-Seq experiments based on Second Generation Sequencing (SGS) short reads have enabledremarkable advances in our ability to analyze the transcriptome a few fundamental problems remain unsolveddue to the high complexity of the genome and the inability to identify combinatorial genomic events. ThirdGeneration Sequencing (TGS) including PacBio sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) whichprovide much longer reads (1-100kb) has the potential to overcome these problems. However the currenthigh-cost and laborious strategy of only using PacBio data is not practical for mid-size labs. Hybrid sequencing(Hybrid-Seq) which integrates TGS and SGS data has emerged as an approach to address the limitationsassociated with analysis of short SGS reads and the error rate of TGS reads. However tools to analyze Hybrid-Seq transcriptome data are not currently available because the majority of methodological developments havefocused on Hybrid-Seq genomic data. In order to improve our understanding of transcriptome complexity wewill develop a comprehensive Hybrid-Seq platform of novel statistical and computational methods to analyzeTGS long reads with the aid of SGS short reads and to identify gene isoforms fusion transcripts and allele-specific expression (ASE). The proposed studies build on our published and preliminary work where wedeveloped methods for error correction for TGS data and detection of novel gene isoforms which were appliedto Hybrid-Seq transcriptome data from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In Aim 1 we will developcomputational and statistical approaches to identify and quantify gene isoforms. In Aim 2 we will developcomputational methods to discover fusion transcripts. In Aim 3 we will determine the haplotypes of gene allelesand quantify ASE using Hybrid-Seq data. The methods developed in this proposal will be integrated into asoftware platform for analysis of Hybrid-Seq transcriptome data. This user-friendly bioinformatics platform willhave important positive impacts by providing an unprecedented opportunity for comprehensive transcriptomeprofiling with broad applicability and higher resolution. In addition these tools will enable more researchers toapply Hybrid-Seq to their transcriptome studies.","Address;Alleles;Bayesian Analysis;Bioinformatics;Biological Sciences;Biomedical Research;Collaborations;Computer software;Computing Methodologies;Consensus;Data;Data Analyses;Data Set;Detection;Development;Diploidy;Embryo;Event;Exons;Foundations;Generations;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Gold;Haplotypes;Human;Hybrids;Inosine Diphosphate;Laboratories;Length;Methods;Modeling;Pathologic Processes;Phase;Physiological Processes;Positioning Attribute;Protein Isoforms;Publishing;Reading;Recurrence;Research;Research Personnel;Resolution;Risk;Sampling;Scientist;Seeds;Site;Solid;Statistical Methods;Stem cells;Structure;Techniques;Technology;Transcript;Update;Work;base;combinatorial;cost;fusion gene;genetic variant;genomic data;human data;human embryonic stem cell;improved;malignant breast neoplasm;nanopore;novel;public health relevance;reconstruction;reference genome;research study;tool;transcriptome;transcriptome sequencing;user-friendly","Bioinformatics platform for Hybrid-Seq transcriptome data analysis","PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENTHybrid-Seq strategy combines the strengths of Third Generation Sequencing and Second GenerationSequencing and overcomes the weakness of two techniques.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Neurosciences","SummaryThe identification and characterization of novel deafness genes have been a fruitful approach to gain insightsinto the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and function of hair cells (HCs). The identificationof deafness-causing mutations is also a key step towards developing new therapies. However the pathologicalmutations are typically found in genes whose products cannot be manipulated favorably with existing drugs.Our preliminary data suggest that a previously unidentified deafness gene in the DFNA27 locus is anexception. DFNA27 is associated with autosomal-dominant progressive non-syndromic hearing loss. One ofthe genes in this locus encodes REST a DNA binding protein that represses the transcription of its targetgenes by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs). In non-neuronal cells REST represses the expression ofhundreds of neuronal genes. In postmitotic neurons REST is itself repressed by at least two mechanisms: areduction of transcription and incorporation of an alternative exon that contains a STOP codon (exon-S) intothe REST mRNA. The objective of the proposed research is to establish how REST function is affected byDFNA27 how REST is regulated in HCs which genes it represses and how responsive it is to drug treatment.Our central hypothesis is that alternative splicing of Rest is critical for the de-repression of a cascade ofgene-expression changes in HCs and that HDAC inhibitors can compensate for the DFNA27-caused defect inthe alternative splicing-dependent inactivation of Rest in mouse models. This hypothesis is based on ourpreliminary studies showing that: 1) in mice heterozygous for the global deletion of exon-S (Rest+/dS) HCsdegenerate; 2) in mice heterozygous for the HC-specific deletion of exon-S HCs also degenerate; 3) Rest+/dSmice do not have any obvious defects other than deafness and impaired balance; 4) DFNA27 subjects harbora mutation in REST; 5) in cultured cells the DFNA27 mutation inhibits the alternative splicing-dependentinactivation of REST; 6) HDAC inhibitors prevent the loss of HCs in organ of Corti cultures of Rest+/dS mice; 7)impaired inactivation of Rest leads to reduced expression of the epigenetic regulator Baf53b; and 8) the lack ofBaf53b causes hearing loss in mice. We propose 3 specific aims: 1) determine the contributions of alternativesplicing and transcriptional regulation to the repression of Rest in HCs versus neurons; 2) determine the effectsof HDAC inhibitors on the phenotype of Rest-mutant mice and evaluate the frequency of REST mutations in adiagnostic program for the hearing impaired; and 3) establish the effect of exon-S splicing on the HCtranscriptome and establish the function of the Rest-repressed epigenetic regulator Baf53b in HCs. These aimswill be achieved using a variety of methods ranging from transcriptome analysis to drug efficacy tests in mice.The proposed studies are significant because defining the effect of DFNA27 on the regulation and function ofREST will reveal key features of the transcriptional program of differentiating HCs and has the potential to leadto the development of a preventative treatment for DFNA27-associated hearing loss.","Affect;Alleles;Alternative Splicing;Audiology;Cell Survival;Cells;Chromatin;Clinics and Hospitals;Codon Nucleotides;Complex;Cultured Cells;DNA Binding;DNA-Binding Proteins;Data;Deafness;Defect;Development;Diagnostic;Epigenetic Process;Equilibrium;Exons;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Genotype;Goals;Hair Cells;Hearing;Histones;Human;Iowa;Knowledge;Labyrinth;Lead;Messenger RNA;Methods;Microarray Analysis;Molecular;Molecular Diagnosis;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Neuroglia;Neurons;Organ;Organ of Corti structure;Outer Hair Cells;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Phenotype;Preventive treatment;Public Health;RNA Splicing;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Repression;Research;Rest;Sensory Hair;Site;Testing;Transcriptional Regulation;Transgenic Mice;Universities;base;clinical care;diagnostic screening;drug efficacy;efficacy testing;equilibration disorder;gene function;gene repression;hearing impairment;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mouse model;neuron development;novel;novel therapeutics;prevent;programs;promoter;relating to nervous system;transcription factor;transcriptome","Transcriptional regulation by a novel deafness gene in the DFNA27 locus","Project NarrativeThe proposed project is relevant to public health in that it is expected to identify and characterize a noveldeafness gene and to thereby advance our knowledge in the field of audiology.

"Autoimmune Disease; Biotechnology; Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS)","The vast majority of currently licensed human vaccines work on the basis of long-term protectiveantibody responses. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are CD4+ T cells specialized in providing help to B cellsparticularly within germinal centers (GCs). With Tfh cells delivering help signals via costimulatory moleculesand cytokines B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation within GCs generating plasmacells and memory B cells and with greater protective efficacy. Tfh cells are also found in great abundance inperipheral blood of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and myasthenia gravis suggesting a role of Tfhcells in pathogenic autoantibody production. Therefore increasing our knowledge of Tfh cell development andfunction in normal and aberrant immune responses will aid design of more efficacious vaccines againstinfectious diseases and discovery of novel therapeutic approaches to treat autoimmunity. Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors are essential for normal T cell development and are known tointeract with the -catenin coactivator for gene regulation. Previously we showed Tcf1 and Lef1 criticallyregulate longevity and maturation of memory CD8+ T cells. We conditionally ablated both genes in mature Tcells to bypass the impact on thymocyte development and showed Tcf1 and Lef1 are also essential for Tfhdifferentiation. Our recent ChIPseq mapping of the Tcf1 cistrome in Tfh cells revealed it is broadly associatedwith the Tfh genetic program beyond the reported Bcl6-Blimp1 axis. We also made a surprising finding thatTcf1 and Lef1 are not only transcriptional regulators but also have intrinsic histone deacetylase (HDAC)activity. These unexpected findings led us to hypothesize that Tcf1 and Lef1 couple the intrinsic HDACactivity with their -catenin- and DNA-binding capacity to shape the enhancer landscapetranscriptional programs and functionality of Tfh cells. Our specific aims are:Specific Aim 1. To determine how Tcf1 and Lef1 control enhancer organization and transcriptionalprogramming during effector Tfh differentiation..Specific Aim 2. To investigate the necessity and sufficiency of -catenin pathway in Tfh differentiation. This application will use viral infection models to systematically investigate Tcf1/Lef1 transcriptionfactors -catenin coactivator and their interaction as novel regulators of Tfh differentiation at the initiationeffector and memory phases. It is particularly exciting that Tcf1 and Lef1 directly bridge transcriptional andepigenetic regulation in Tfh cells which will establish a new paradigm in coordination of genetic and epigeneticregulation. These studies will thus provide rationales for utilizing the Tcf1/Lef1--catenin pathway to enhanceTfh functions for more effective vaccines or to dampen Tfh activities for treating autoimmune diseases.","Acute;Address;Affect;Affinity;Animal Model;Antibody Affinity;Antibody Response;Antigens;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmunity;B-Lymphocytes;BLR1 gene;Binding;Bypass;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Communicable Diseases;DNA Binding;Dendritic Cells;Development;Enhancers;Epigenetic Process;Gene Expression Regulation;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Programming;Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte;Histone Deacetylase;Histones;Human;Hypersensitivity;Immune response;Immunization;Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation;Immunologic Memory;Infection;Knowledge;Licensing;Life;Link;Longevity;Lymphoid;Maps;Mature T-Lymphocyte;Memory;Memory B-Lymphocyte;Methods;Modeling;Myasthenia Gravis;Organ;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Plasma Cells;Process;Production;Protein Isoforms;Reporting;Role;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Staging;Structure of germinal center of lymph node;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Development;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Thymocyte Development;Transcriptional Regulation;Transgenic Organisms;Up-Regulation;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Virus Diseases;Work;base;beta catenin;chemokine receptor;cytokine;design;differentiated B cell;epigenetic regulation;in vivo Model;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;pathogen;peripheral blood;programs;protective efficacy;response;therapy development;transcription factor","Tcf/Lef and B-catenin pathway in follicular helper T cells","The vast majority of currently licensed human vaccines work on the basis of long-term protective antibodyresponses.

"Atherosclerosis; Biotechnology; Cardiovascular","PROJECT SUMMARYClinical hypertriglyceridemia is common and is only partially responsive to available drugs. Converselyexcess triglyceride delivery to individual tissues can lead to skeletal muscle insulin resistance cardiaclipotoxicity or severe inflammatory responses. Given the importance of proper triglyceride delivery it isimperative that we understand the mechanisms that regulate this process. Two proteins normallyrequired for triglyceride clearance are lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and GPIHBP1. LPL is required for theactual hydrolysis of plasma triglyceides liberating fatty acids for tissue uptake. The endothelial cellprotein GPIHBP1 is required to properly localize LPL to the vascular lumen where lipolysis takes place.The long term goal of the proposed research is to understand and ultimately modulate the delivery oftriglyceride-derived fatty acids to specific tissues. The objectives in this application are to advance ourunderstanding of how the angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) proteins ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 modulatetriglyceride clearance. ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 can both inhibit LPL in vitro and ANGPTL3 orANGPTL4 deficiency leads to lower plasma triglyceride levels. However if and how ANGPTL3 andANGPTL4 directly modulate LPL/GPIHBP1-mediated triglyceride clearance is not clear. Moreover theplasma triglyceride levels in mice deficient in both GPIHBP1 and ANGPTL4 indicate that ANGPTL4 mayregulate an uncharacterized GPIHBP1-independent triglyceride clearance pathway. These issues will beaddressed by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Define the mechanisms by which ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4modulate GPIHBP1-dependent triglyceride clearance; and 2) Identify novel mechanisms of GPIHBP1-independent triglyceride clearance. The studies in aim 1 employ cell culturebased binding and lipaseactivity assays as well as in vivo injection of recombinant proteins and tissue-specific knockout mice toinvestigate how ANGPTL proteins interact with GPIHBP1/LPL complexes on the surface of endothelialcells. The second aim will address the remarkably lower triglycerides in Angptl4/Gpihbp1/ mice.Triglyceride clearance and fatty acid uptake assays will be used to identify the tissues to whichtriglycerides get cleared. Expression protein and lipase activity analysis will be used to identify theproteins responsible for this clearance. The approaches in the proposed research are innovativebecause they combine standard methods with novel mouse models to address previously untestedquestions about how triglyceride clearance is regulated. The proposed studies are significant becausethey will elucidate how and where ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 modulate levels of functional LPL toinfluence triglyceride delivery and will uncover novel mechanisms of triglyceride clearance that do notrequire vascular LPL ultimately permitting new strategies designed to prevent or treat dyslipidemia.","ANGPTL3 gene;ANGPTL4 gene;Address;Angiopoietins;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological Assay;Blood Vessels;Blood capillaries;Capillary Endothelial Cell;Cardiac;Cell Culture System;Cell Culture Techniques;Clinical;Complex;Data;Deposition;Dyslipidemias;Employee Strikes;Endothelial Cells;Fatty Acids;Fenestrated Capillary;Fibrates;GPI Membrane Anchors;Goals;High Density Lipoproteins;Human;Hydrolysis;Hyperlipidemia;Hypertriglyceridemia;In Vitro;Individual;Inflammatory Response;Injection of therapeutic agent;Insulin Resistance;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Lipase;Lipids;Lipolysis;Liver;Mediating;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic syndrome;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Mus;N-terminal;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Plasma;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Recombinant Proteins;Regulation;Research;Serum;Skeletal Muscle;Surface;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Triglyceride Metabolism;Triglycerides;Work;base;burden of illness;capillary;cardiovascular risk factor;design;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;innovation;lipoprotein lipase;lipoprotein triglyceride;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;prevent;protein expression;restoration;uptake","Regulation of GPIHBP1-dependent and independent triglyceride clearance","PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because dissecting how and where keyregulators of triglyceride clearance act is expected to increase our understanding of triglyceridemetabolism and fatty acid delivery and ultimately lead to improved methods of treating orpreventing dyslipidemia.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","Asymmetric cell division (ACD) critically controls the fates of dividing stem cells during normal embryonicdevelopment and misregulation of ACD is implicated in tumorigenesis. -catenin a key transcriptional effectorof Wnt signaling is negatively regulated by a destruction complex containing casein kinase I (CK1) and twoscaffolds Axin and APC which trigger -catenin degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits this complex through theFrizzled (Fz) receptor and its effector Dishevelled (Dvl) allowing -catenin to accumulate. However themechanisms that regulate the differential accumulation of -catenin after ACD are unclear in any system.Elucidating these mechanisms would provide broadly important insight into cell fate specification. Our objectiveis to determine the mechanisms of -catenin regulation during ACD. C. elegans exhibits Wnt-regulatedasymmetric stem cell divisions where only one of the daughter cells activates Wnt target genes. These ACDsthus provide an ideally powerful experimental model for understanding Wnt signaling in an intact organism. Wehave found that the C. elegans -catenin SYS-1 is regulated by an ortholog of the vertebrate destructioncomplex component APR-1/APC which asymmetrically localizes to one pole of the dividing cell and controlasymmetric SYS-1 levels after ACD. We will test the central hypothesis that because tight control of SYS-1regulation is required multiple SYS-1 negative regulatory mechanisms are needed in ACD. Supporting this wehave shown that PRY-1/Axin is required to establish the site of SYS-1 destruction by localizing APR-1/APC.We have also shown that SYS-1 is negatively regulated by localization to mother cell centrosomes duringACD. Our data also implicate an asymmetric nuclear export mechanism in the unsignaled daughter. Wepropose to: Aim 1. Determine the mechanism by which asymmetric PRY-1/Axin activity is achieved. To test ourhypothesis that Wnt ligands activate a Fz/Dvl-based PRY-1 polarization mechanism we will: A) determine thelocation of the functional destruction complex during normal ACD and after optogenetically inducing Wntexpression to alter mother cell polarity B) examine the ability of Dvl to generate signalosomes and inactivatethe destruction complex and C) identify the protein interactions that lead to asymmetric PRY-1/Axin activity.Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of centrosomal control of SYS-1-dependent cell fate. To test our hypothesisthat mother cell SYS-1 localizes to the centrosome and is degraded during ACD we will A) conduct pulse-chase assays using a photoconvertible SYS-1 to examine centrosomal SYS-1 inheritance B) genetically placecentrosomal regulators in the Wnt pathway C) examine the whether centrosomal SYS-1 regulation ismicrotubule-dependent and D) extend our analyses to human -catenin. Aim 3. Determine the role of nuclearexport in asymmetric SYS-1 nuclear accumulation. To test the hypothesis that asymmetric SYS-1 nuclearexport occurs in the unsignaled daughter we will: A) determine how the nuclear asymmetry mechanism reflectsthe source of Wnt ligand and B) determine if CKI generally regulates nuclear export or is specific to SYS-1.","AXIN1 protein;Animals;Binding;Biological;Biological Assay;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Polarity;Cell division;Cells;Centrosome;Complex;Data;Daughter;Development;Disease;Embryonic Development;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Targeting;Genetic Epistasis;Goals;Human;Human Development;Inherited;Lead;Life;Ligands;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Microtubules;Modeling;Mothers;Nematoda;Nuclear;Nuclear Export;Organism;Orthologous Gene;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Physiologic pulse;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Research;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Source;Stem cells;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;United States National Institutes of Health;base;beta catenin;casein kinase;cell fate specification;daughter cell;experience;human disease;in vivo;insight;new therapeutic target;novel;prevent;receptor;scaffold;stem cell biology;stem cell division;tumor;tumorigenesis","Novel Beta-catenin Regulatory Mechanisms in C. elegans Asymmetric Cell Divisions","The results of the proposed research are relevant to public health because they areexpected provide new insights into the mechanisms by which conserved cell signalingpathways control asymmetric cell division during human development and tumorformation.

A safe and efficient i.v. dosed nanoparticle delivery system to transfect liverhepatocytes to express secreted hFVIII would be transformative for treating hemophilia A. Comparedto hydrodynamic dosing of plasmid DNA all other nanoparticle delivery systems are currently tooinefficient to achieve therapeutic levels of protein expression in liver primarily due to the inability ofplasmid DNA to traverse the nuclear membrane of non-dividing hepatocytes. The preliminary dataestablishes that efficient expression can be achieved using double stranded mRNA. Nanoparticlesare generated using a novel PEG-peptide containing Lys-Acr residues that binds to ds mRNA. Thedelivery of ds mRNA nanoparticles to the cytosol circumvents the major barrier that limits expressionof plasmid DNA. The first aim of the proposal will advance ds mRNA nanoparticles by increasingcirculatory stability and persistence of expression. Multivalent PEG-peptides will be developed thatbind ds RNA with higher affinity to further increase ds mRNA nanoparticles stability following i.v.dosing. Persistent expression will be achieved by developing self-amplifying mRNA constructsdesigned to replicate mRNA in the cytosol and extend its expression. Efficient hepatocyte targetingwill be attained using a high-affinity triantennary N-glycan attached to the PEG-peptide to mediatenanoparticle endocytosis into hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor. The potent membranelytic peptide melittin will be reversible attached to ds mRNA to afford triggered release of mRNA intothe cytosol.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","Project summary/AbstractThe long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the molecular mechanismsunderlying the function and regulation of cGMP-phosphodiesterases (PDE6) in rods andcones. PDE6 is a key effector enzyme in the phototransduction cascade. The clinicalimportance of PDE6 is evident from the fact that its malfunction due to mutations ingenes encoding it or the specialized chaperone aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interactingprotein-like 1 (AIPL1) lead to severe retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosaachromatopsia and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). For many years progress inunderstanding the structure and function of PDE6 has been hampered by a lack of aneffective heterologous expression system. The current proposal takes advantage of anovel robust system based on the co-expression of cone PDE6C with AIPL1 and theinhibitory -subunit (P) in HEK293T cells. This system offers a unique opportunity togain mechanistic insights into the interaction between PDE6 and AIPL1 and theirclient/chaperone relationship. Mutational analysis of PDE6C will be performed to identifythe structural determinants of the catalytic efficiency of PDE6 and to elucidate themechanisms whereby mutations lead to disease. We will test the hypothesis that manypathogenic mutations disrupt the interaction of PDE6 with Pleading to markedlydiminished expression of functional PDE6. Using enzymatic activity as readout for theAIPL1 chaperone function we will examine the roles of AIPL1 domains and specificpartner interactions in the folding of PDE6 and delineate the mechanisms wherebyAIPL1 mutations cause LCA. We propose and will test a model in which P augmentsexpression of functional PDE6 by acting as an affinity adaptor for the AIPL1-PDE6interaction during maturation of the enzyme. Our biochemical studies will becomplemented by structural analyses (X-ray crystallography and NMR) aimed atobtaining a high-resolution structure of AIPL1 in complex with the PDE6 prenyl moietyand P. This structure will signify an unprecedented advance in understanding AIPL1and its interaction with PDE6. The ultimate goal of the proposed studies is to generatecritical insights into the mechanisms that underlie PDE6- and AIPL1-linked retinaldiseases and to thereby contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies.","ARA9 protein;Affinity;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Blindness;Catalytic Domain;Cells;Client;Clinical;Complement;Complex;Cone;Cyclic GMP;Development;Diffusion;Disease;Enzymes;FK506;FKBP1B gene;Failure;Family;Foundations;Functional disorder;Genes;Goals;Heat-Shock Proteins 90;Homology Modeling;Human;Impairment;Ions;Kinetics;Lead;Leber&apos;s amaurosis;Light;Link;Metals;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Mutation;Patients;Photoreceptors;Phototransduction;Physiology;Positioning Attribute;Property;Protein Binding Domain;Regulation;Research;Resolution;Retinal;Retinal Diseases;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Role;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;System;Tacrolimus Binding Proteins;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Vertebrate Photoreceptors;Vision;Vision Disorders;Work;X-Ray Crystallography;abstracting;achromatopsia;base;inorganic phosphate;insight;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;phosphodiesterase 6;phosphoric diester hydrolase;prenyl;programs","Regulation of Retinal cGMP-Phosphodiesterases","Project Narrative.Rod and cone cGMP phosphodiesterases (PDE6 family) are the key effector enzymes invision that depend on a specialized chaperone aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interactingprotein-like 1 (AIPL1) for their folding and activity.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases","Project SummaryClostridium difficile the most common cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea is responsible for250000 infections and 14000 deaths each year in the United States alone. Despite the clinical impactof C. difficile relatively little is known about the factors of C. difficile required to colonize the host andevade host immune defenses. Several lines of evidence suggest components of the innate immunesystem play an important role in controlling C. difficile infections. Our long-term goal is to betterunderstand how C. difficile resists the innate immune defenses during an infection. The bacterial cellenvelope is essential for cell viability and is the target of many components of the innate immune system.Lysozyme is an important component of the innate immune system. We found that C. difficile is highlyresistant to lysozyme. We have identified a C. difficile Extra-Cytoplasmic Function (ECF)  factor Vencoded by csfV which is specifically induced by lysozyme and is critical to lysozyme resistance in C.difficile and is an important virulence factor in an animal model of C. difficile infection. ECF  factorsrepresent an important class of signal transduction systems which respond to cell envelope stresses.V is activated upon the sequential proteolytic destruction of the anti- factor RsiV. Our data indicatethat RsiV becomes sensitive to proteases upon binding directly to lysozyme. The X-ray crystal co-structure of the RsiV-lysozyme complex revealed not only the regions involved in binding lysozyme butalso that RsiV likely functions as a lysozyme inhibitor. This finding raises several important questions:How is does RsiV binding to lysozyme binding control activation of V? How does RsiV avoid site-1cleavage in the absence of lysozyme? What genes are important for mediating lysozyme resistance inC. difficile?

"Clinical Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); HIV/AIDS; Infectious Diseases; Substance Abuse","AbstractThe AIDS pandemic remains a significant global problem with over 33.3 million persons currentlyinfected with HIV and HIV-related illnesses claiming the lives of over 1.8 million individuals annually.Various studies have suggested a link between abuse of illicit drugs including cocaine and increasedrisk of HIV transmission accelerated HIV disease progression and AIDS-related mortality. Womenrepresent the fastest growing population of new HIV cases. It is estimated that more than 80% of HIVcases result from sexual transmission and semen is the primary vector. However only about 0.1% ofacts of heterosexual coitus with an infected individual result in HIV infection suggesting that factorscontained in semen may modulate the infectivity or fitness of HIV particles in semen. The underlyingmechanisms of HIV transmission are not well understood. In spite of the progress in studies of HIVpathogenesis and the ability of various agents to suppress virus infection methods to prevent HIVtransmission still require more investigation. Recently we showed that semen of healthy donorscontain heterologous populations of exosomes that are morphologically distinct with respect to sizeand electron density. These exosomes contain different species of RNA (mRNA and small RNA) andinhibit infection with HIV. Our preliminary data reveal that similar to exosomes from the semen ofhealthy donors exosomes purified from HIV infected donors potently block HIV infection whileexosomes from HIV infected donors who use cocaine do not inhibit HIV. Our preliminary study furthershowed that HIV infection and cocaine use modulates RNA composition of semen exosomes.Importantly lysed semen exosomes from both HIV negative and HIV infected donors but not donorswho used cocaine inhibit reverse transcription of lysed HIV in a cell-free system block the synthesis ofHIV U5 DNA and reverse transcription of U5 to Gag. These data indicate direct effect of semenexosomes on HIV reverse transcription. In this application studies are designed to 1) determine theeffect of HIV infection and cocaine abuse on the anti-HIV activity of semen exosomes 2) determinethe mechanisms of anti-HIV effect of semen exosomes and 3) characterize the effects of donor HIVstatus and cocaine use on semen exosome composition. As sexual transmission is the main route forthe spread of HIV and semen is the primary vector the studies proposed in this application willaddress a new challenge for evaluation of the efficacy of semen exosomes as a protective factoragainst HIV and how donor HIV status and cocaine use modulate this function.","AIDS prevention;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Address;Affect;Antiviral Agents;Binding Proteins;Biological Assay;Cell-Free System;Cells;Cocaine;Cocaine Abuse;Coitus;Complex;Cytolysis;DNA;Data;Development;Disease Progression;Electrons;Epithelial Cells;Foundations;Goals;HIV;HIV Infections;HIV-1;Heterosexuals;Human;Illicit Drugs;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Inflammatory;Intrinsic factor;Investigation;Life Cycle Stages;Link;Lymphatic;Messenger RNA;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Pathogenesis;Persons;Population;Process;RNA;RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;Recording of previous events;Research Design;Research Personnel;Reverse Transcription;Risk;Role;Route;Seminal fluid;Sexual Transmission;Small RNA;Test Result;Therapeutic;Vagina;Variant;Virus;Virus Diseases;Woman;abstracting;base;cocaine exposure;cocaine use;cytokine;density;efficacy evaluation;electron density;exosome;fitness;frontier;genetic information;mortality;novel;pandemic disease;particle;pathogen;prevent;transmission process;vector","The effect of HIV and cocaine abuse on semen exosome composition and function","NarrativeThe studies we propose in this application will evaluate if the composition and function ofexosomes present in the semen of HIV infected donors is distinct from that of healthy donorsand evaluate if cocaine abuse will modulate the composition and function of exosomes in thesemen of HIV infected donors.

"Cancer; Genetics; Hematology; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","Project SummaryDespite enormous progress in blood cancer research the ability to treat and prevent multiple myeloma thesecond most common hematologic cancer in the United States remains severely limited. This is particularlytrue for the subset of patients diagnosed with high-risk myeloma. Addressing the current limitations will requireadditional research efforts including projects on the biological significance of recently discovered candidatehigh-risk myeloma drivers such as the forkhead box M1 transcription factor FOXM1.The long-term goal of this research program is to improve the outcome of myeloma and related plasma cellneoplasms. The main objective of the specific research project proposed here is to elucidate the mechanismby which FOXM1 enhances the aggressiveness of myeloma. The central hypothesis is that FOXM1 drives andaffords a promising treatment opportunity for high-risk myeloma. Two specific Research Aims have beendesigned to test this hypothesis and achieve the objective of this application.The studies in Aim 1 will employ human myeloma cell lines and patient-derived myeloma cells to assess therole of FOXM1 in myeloma biology (e.g. clonogenic growth and survival) and myeloma genetics (e.g. FOXM1target genes and drug sensitivity). The experimental strategy includes the inducible up or down regulation ofFOXM1 in myeloma cells ChIP-seq analysis of the FOXM1-governed gene network and the determination ofFOXM1 levels in myeloma cells in the course of disease progression.The studies in Aim 2 will determine whether FOXM1 drives neoplastic plasma cell development in a geneticallyengineered mouse model of human myeloma. An additional objective concerns the correlation of FOXM1status of myeloma-like tumors in mice with the response to small-molecule FOXM1 and proteasome inhibitors.The experimental strategy includes the adoptive transfer of genetically tagged B-lymphocytes that expresselevated levels of human FOXM1. Also included are preclinical treatment studies in which the response ofmyeloma-like tumors to proteasome inhibition will be assessed.Supported by strong preliminary results that provide a sound rationale for this application the proposedresearch is poised to facilitate novel targeted approaches to the therapy of high-risk multiple myeloma.","Address;Adoptive Transfer;Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation;B-Lymphocytes;Biological;Biological Models;Biology;Carcinoma;Cell Line;Cells;ChIP-seq;Chromosomal translocation;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Cytogenetics;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Progression;Dose;Down-Regulation;Drug resistance;Evaluation;Event;Exhibits;Experimental Models;FOXM1 gene;Gene Expression;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic screening method;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Growth;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic Neoplasms;Human;Inferior;Iowa;Laboratories;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Modeling;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Target;Multiple Myeloma;Mus;Natural History;Neoplastic Plasma Cell;Newly Diagnosed;Oncogenes;Oncology Group;Outcome;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma Cell Neoplasm;Plasma Cells;Prevention;Proteasome Inhibition;Proteasome Inhibitor;Regulation;Research;Research Project Grants;Risk;Role;Sampling;Side;Solid;Subgroup;Testing;Thiostrepton;Translations;Tumor Cell Line;United States;Universities;Up-Regulation;Validation;Work;acquired drug resistance;anticancer research;base;cohort;design;drug sensitivity;epigenome;follow-up;high risk;improved outcome;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;knock-down;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;outcome forecast;patient subsets;plasma cell development;pre-clinical;prevent;programs;response;small molecule;sound;stemness;targeted treatment;transcription factor;tumor","Validation of FOXM1 as a new therapeutic target in high-risk myeloma","Project NarrativePlasma-cell myeloma commonly known as multiple myeloma is a common but difficult-to-cure hematologicmalignancy.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","Project Summary/AbstractMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that affectsover 400000 people in the US. The most common clinical form of MS presents with a relapsing-remittingclinical course (RRMS). Whereas several immune differences have been shown between RRMS patients andhealthy subjects the immunologic basis of a clinical relapse remains poorly understood. Some studies haveshown aberrant immune responses to myelin antigens and defect in regulatory T and B cells during an acutedisease relapse. However the immune dysregulation that underlies the relapse remains unclear. In particularthere is a paucity of longitudinal studies addressing CD4 and CD8 T cell effector and regulatory responsesbefore during and after an acute relapse. Using innovative approaches our recent studies have madeseveral interesting observations relating to CD4 and CD8 regulatory T cell biology during acute relapseof MS. We have demonstrated the novel and unexpected immune regulatory function of CNS-specific CD8+ Tcells. Interestingly RRMS patients with quiescent disease and healthy subjects showed comparable levels ofCNS-specific CD8 suppressor activity. However patients during an acute relapse showed a dramaticdeficit of CNS-specific suppressor activity even when CNS-specific CD8 responses could be detectedat pre-relapse level. Moreover as patients attained disease quiescence [with various different therapies]they consistently showed normalization of CNS-specific CD8 suppressor activity. We have further observedthat these deficits are correctable by modulation of the cytokine milieu and through understanding of themechanisms through which immune regulation is achieved. In recent unpublished studies we have alsoshown the dysregulation of a novel sub-population of induced CD4+ regulatory T cells during an acute MSrelapse. Based on these findings we hypothesize that an accumulating longitudinal deficit of immuneregulatory function and effector resistance results in an MS relapse. As a corollary we predict thatcorrecting these functional deficits is an important immunologic correlate of disease quiescence. Through theproposed studies we will address these hypotheses by delineating the longitudinal fluctuation of CD4 and CD8regulatory ability and its relationship with an MS relapse. We will dissect the various mechanisms of relapse-associated CD8 regulatory deficit and attempt to devise strategies to correct the observed deficits. Theproposed studies will provide greater fundamental insights into the immunologic processes underlying diseaserelapse with the potential for novel immunotherapeutic strategies.","Acute;Acute Disease;Address;Affect;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antigens;Autoimmune Process;B-Lymphocytes;Biology;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cells;Cellular biology;Characteristics;Clinical;Defect;Demyelinations;Disease;Dissection;Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis;Future;Goals;Granzyme;Histology;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunologic Monitoring;Immunologics;Immunology;Immunotherapeutic agent;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Inflammatory;Institution;Interferon Type II;Interleukin-12;Longitudinal Studies;Mediating;Modeling;Multiple Sclerosis;Myelin;Neuraxis;Pathogenesis;Patients;Population;Process;Publishing;Recruitment Activity;Recurrent disease;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Relapse;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Staging;Steroid therapy;Steroids;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;abstracting;autoreactive T cell;base;central nervous system demyelinating disorder;chemokine receptor;cytokine;immunopathology;innovation;insight;interest;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;perforin;response","Immune Dysregulation During Multiple Sclerosis Relapse","Project NarrativeThe immunology of MS relapse is poorly understood.

"Genetics; Neurosciences","The initiation of translation is an important point of control in the response of cells to environmental stress.Stress conditions activate stress-responsive kinases that inhibit translation initiation by phosphorylatingthe alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) which results in polysome disassembly andsubsequent attenuation of translation. In addition to attenuating translation stressful environments alsoactivate the transcription of protective molecular chaperones or heat shock proteins (HSPs). One of themajor recent developments in the understanding of stress responses is the discovery that thetranscriptional expression of chaperones during stress is not triggered autonomously by cells undergoingmacromolecular damage but is instead cell non-autonomously orchestrated by the nervous system.However it is not known whether translational attenuation across the different cells of a metazoanis also coordinated through similar cell-cell signaling pathways that modulate transcription. Inongoing studies we have found that although transcription of chaperones and translational attenuationoccur independent of each other upon heat shock as with the transcriptional upregulation of chaperonegene expression the phosphorylation of eIF2 upon heat stress in C. elegans is dependent on theserotonergic system. These data suggest that serotonergic control over eIF2 phosphorylation may actto integrate transcriptional and translational responses to stress across cells of an organism. This is thehypothesis we aim to test in this proposal. Specifically we will test (1) how translation attenuation iscoupled to neuronal serotonin release and (2) whether translation attenuation is coordinated with HSPupregulation through neuronal 5-HT release. We anticipate that these studies will fill a critical gap inknowledge regarding the coordination of translational upon stress between tissues of a metazoan. Thesestudies will therefore be important for understanding how stress contributes to the progression ofmetabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and allow the development of new strategies for diagnosisand treatment.","Ablation;Animal Model;Attenuated;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cells;Cellular Stress Response;Chaperone Gene;Control Animal;Coupled;Data;Development;Diagnosis;EIF-2alpha;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Environment;Eukaryotic Initiation Factors;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;HSF1;Heat Stress Disorders;Heat shock proteins;Heat-Shock Response;Knowledge;Metabolic Diseases;Molecular Chaperones;Nervous system structure;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Organism;Pathway interactions;Peptide Initiation Factors;Phase;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Polyribosomes;Process;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Kinase;Proteins;Repression;Role;Serotonergic System;Serotonin;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stress;Testing;Tissues;Translation Initiation;Translations;Up-Regulation;Work;attenuation;biological adaptation to stress;body system;cell type;environmental stressor;gene induction;intercellular communication;meetings;neurotransmission;optogenetics;programs;receptor;response","Uncovering non-autonomous mechanisms of control over translational attenuation during heat shock in the metazoan C. elegans","Stress conditions activate stress-responsive kinases that inhibit the initiation of protein translationby phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2).

"Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases; Regenerative Medicine","Communication at the first visual synapse is mediated by L-type voltage-gated Cav1.4 Ca2+channels. These channels are concentrated in the synaptic terminal beneath the ribbon anorganelle characteristic of synapses employing tonic neurotransmitter release. Mutation ofCav1.4 inhibits neurotransmission but can also prevent synaptic development. Loss of Cav1.4can present as a variety of visual diseases including congenital stationary night blindness orcone-rod dystrophy. We have validated that restoration of Cav1.4 in Cav1.4 knockout mice priorto synaptogenesis prevents these defects. But treatments for photoreceptor synaptic diseasesare needed for mature individuals. In Aim 1 we will test the efficiency of synaptic rescue whenCav1.4 expression is induced in these mice after synaptogenesis is normally complete. This willbe accomplished by using a strategy of tamoxifen-inducible gene expression from plasmidselectroporated into mouse photoreceptors followed by morphological and functionalcharacterization of the synapses that form in adulthood. Regardless of when Cav1.4 expressionis desired for basic or pre-clinical studies the limited efficiency of electroporation inhibitsadvances in this field. Viral mediated gene expression is very effective and safe in the retinawith AAV being the preferred vector. However AAV does not have the capacity to express largegenes like Cav1.4. In Aim 2 we will develop multiple AAV vectors expressing fragments ofCav1.4 engineered for post-translational recombination by trans-intein splicing and test theeffectiveness of this strategy for achieving expression of Cav1.4 in adult mouse photoreceptors.Success in this area will not only accelerate research on Cav1.4 but could be adapted to otherlarge genes that are prime candidates for retinal gene therapy but currently cannot beaccommodated in AAV. Together this work exploring the regenerative capacity ofphotoreceptor synapses and expansion of the utility of AAV for retinal gene therapy will greatlyadvance efforts to save and restore vision.","Address;Adult;Affect;Age;Area;Behavioral Assay;Biological Models;Blindness;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical Trials;Communication;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Effectiveness;Electroporation;Engineering;Experimental Models;Failure;Functional disorder;Gene Delivery;Gene Expression;Gene Transduction Agent;Gene therapy trial;Genes;Genetic Recombination;Goals;Health;Human;Image;Immunohistochemistry;Individual;Inherited;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Leber&apos;s amaurosis;Life;Maintenance;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Natural regeneration;Neurons;Night Blindness;Organelles;Patients;Photoreceptors;Physical shape;Physiological;Plasmids;Predisposition;Presynaptic Terminals;Proteins;RNA Splicing;Reporting;Research;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Detachment;Retinal Diseases;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Science;Signal Transduction;Stem cells;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Tamoxifen;Testing;Therapeutic Studies;Time;Trans-Splicing;Translating;Variant;Viral;Vision;Visual;Visual system structure;Work;adeno-associated viral vector;base;effective therapy;gene therapy;human disease;in vivo;inducible gene expression;insight;intein;mouse model;neurotransmission;neurotransmitter release;preclinical study;presynaptic;prevent;regenerative;relating to nervous system;restoration;ribbon synapse;success;synaptogenesis;therapeutic development;tool;treatment strategy;vector;voltage","Rescue of photoreceptor synapses","PROJECT NARRATIVE:In this proposal we will test the regenerative capacity of photoreceptor synapses and develop amethod for making retinal gene therapy vectors for very large genes.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurosciences","Project Summary / AbstractThis research project uses novel technology and innovative strategies to discover moleculardifferences between foveal cones and extrafoveal cells and to identify alterations in photoreceptor cellgene expression in early AMD. A comprehensive interrogation of gene expression in foveal andextrafoveal cones will be important to the field for at least 4 reasons: (1) foveal cones are the mostimportant cells for visual acuity and hence are critical targets for gene augmentation therapy and abetter understanding of their physiology will be important for the development of stem cell directedtherapies; (2) foveal cones persist for years in some patients with AMD leaving a ring scotoma butgood acuity and understanding why they survive may lead to approaches to help rescue otherphotoreceptor cells from degeneration; (3) rod photoreceptors are likely to yield insight into thedelayed dark adaptometry phenotype in AMD; (4) a biological understanding for the morphologicaldifferences in foveal and extrafoveal cones is currently lacking. All of these important biological andtranslational questions will be addressed by the proposed study.The ultimate goal of this research proposal is to identify a set of molecules that can: (1) improve geneaugmentation and stem cell directed therapies; (2) determine why foveal cones are alternativelyspared or targeted by different retinal diseases; and (3) determine the mechanism underlying thedelayed dark adaptation phenotype in AMD patients.

"Aging; Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYThere is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the immunologic mechanisms leading to BP;therefore standard treatment remains global immunosuppression which is associated with significantmorbidity and mortality. Our long-term goal is to understand the reason for the failure of peripheral tolerance inBP and identify cellular or molecular targets for therapeutic use. The objective of this application is todetermine if the development of BP results from a tissue specific loss of tolerance. Our central hypothesis isthat the development of BP lesions is dependent on phenotypic and/or functional alterations in LC andTreg populations in the skin. The rationale for the proposed research is that understanding the factors thatinfluence loss of peripheral tolerance in the skin has the potential to translate into more targeted therapies fororgan-specific autoimmune diseases. Thus the proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH's mission thatpertains to expanding the breadth and depth of knowledge of diseases which will enhance health and reduceillness. Guided by our striking preliminary data this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1)To examine the distribution and phenotype of LC and Treg populations in BP skin biopsies; 2) To determine ifthe loss of tolerance in BP is tissue-specific. Under the first aim we will expand our preliminary data utilizingconfocal microscopy to phenotypically characterize immune cell populations during different stages of thedisease. In the second aim cell populations involved in the maintenance of tolerance will be examined intissues where tolerance has been lost (skin) or maintained (blood) using flow cytometry to assess cellfrequency and phenotype and in vitro functional assays. This project is innovative because it applies the recentadvances in our understanding of resident immune cell populations to human autoimmunity in a disease wherethe target organ skin is readily accessible. The proposed research is significant as it will expand ourunderstanding of mechanisms of tissue-specific autoimmunity in humans which will lead to the development ofmore targeted therapies.","Address;Adhesions;Affect;Age;Antibodies;Antigen Targeting;Apoptosis;Area;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmune Process;Autoimmunity;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Blood;Body Surface;Bulla;Bullous Pemphigoid;Cell physiology;Cells;Confocal Microscopy;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Elderly;Employee Strikes;Enrollment;Exhibits;Failure;Flow Cytometry;Frequencies;Goals;Health;Homing;Human;Immune;Immunity;Immunologics;In Vitro;Individual;Knowledge;Langerhans cell;Lead;Lesion;Maintenance;Mediating;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Natural immunosuppression;Organ;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Population;Production;Proliferation Marker;Proteins;Public Health;Regulation;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Research;Sampling;Skin;Staging;Staining method;Stains;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic Uses;Tissues;Translating;Work;base;cell type;cellular targeting;central tolerance;cytokine;improved;indexing;individual patient;innovation;molecular targeted therapies;mortality;new therapeutic target;novel;peripheral blood;peripheral tolerance;receptor;research study;response;skin circulation;skin disorder;standard care;targeted treatment","Mechanisms of Tissue-Specific Autoimmunity in the Elderly","NARRATIVEThe proposed studies represent an unexplored mechanism of autoimmune skin diseases by investigating thetissue-resident immune cell populations required for the maintenance of peripheral tolerance.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY The field of glycoscience has burgeoned in the last several decades leading to theidentification of many oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates which could serve critical roles in awide range of biological processes. This rapid growth of knowledge about the function ofcarbohydrates has attracted increasing attention from biological pharmacological and medicinalresearchers. Meeting their research demands require access to significant quantities of well-defined bioactive carbohydrates. This has prompted resurgence in synthetic interest with aparticular focus on new approaches to the glycosidic bond. Even with the abundance of elegant reports for stereoselective construction glycosidiclinkages catalytic stereoselective synthesis of - and -oligosaccharides and glycoconjugatesremains challenging and can only be achieved in the context of a limited set of conditions. Oneof glycosidic bonds that has historically proven challenging is -mannosidic bond. This proposalseeks to address this unmet need through the development of a series of predictable andstereoselective - and -12-cis glycosylation reactions via the merger of photoredox catalysiswith nickel catalysis. In each Specific Aim a different type of directing groups and ligandsattached to nickel catalyst will be employed and a fundamentally different strategy will beinvestigated to control anomeric selectivity. As such the proposed methods will provide a varietyof new strategies for the construction of challenging - and -12-cis glycosidic bonds. The proposed stereoselective glycosylation reactions via dual catalysis are significantbecause these type of glycosidic bonds are widely prevalent in bioactive oligosaccharides andglycoconjugates. The proposed reactions are predictable and stereoselective and conductedunder mild and operationally simple conditions without requiring advanced training. Importantlythe new methods have the potential for transforming into automated synthesis.","Address;Air;Alginates;Amino Sugars;Anticoagulants;Antiviral Agents;Attention;Biological;Biological Process;Carbohydrates;Catalysis;Chemistry;Complex;Coupling;Development;Electron Transport;Exhibits;Glycoconjugates;Glycosides;Goals;Growth;Household;Hydroxyl Radical;Inorganic Sulfates;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Iridium;Knowledge;Ligands;Malignant Neoplasms;Mannans;Mannosides;Methods;Nickel;Oligosaccharides;Property;Reaction;Reagent;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Series;Serotyping;Source;Streptococcus pneumoniae;Structure;Sulfonamides;Techniques;Training;Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates;Vaccine Therapy;catalyst;glycosylation;guluronic acid;interest;irradiation;meetings;novel strategies;oxidation;rapid growth","Catalytic Methods for Stereoselective 12-Cis Glycosylation","PROJECT NARRATIVE We have developed mild and operationally simple techniques for attaining complexcarbohydrate targets that exhibit a broad range of potent biological properties such as antiviraland antitumor activities stimulation of growth factors and anticoagulant activity.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Kidney Disease; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric","Project Summary/AbstractThe purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application is tosupport my short-term career objective of quantitatively characterizing brain structure and function in childrenwith mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Over 50% of allcases of pediatric CKD are due to congenital (structural) anomalies and as such the diagnosis portends a life-long diagnosis requiring routine care. Features of renal decline in pediatric CKD include metabolic acidosiscardiovascular disease poor growth and anemiaall of which may have a deleterious multifactorial impacton the developing brain. It is a natural extension that children with advanced CKD are at risk for neurocognitivedecline. Specifically despite generally intact intelligence (IQ) children with CKD demonstrate deficits inexecutive function and academic achievement. Neuroimaging research has utilized heterogenous samples(including end-stage renal disease) with reliance on computerized tomography. No published pediatric studieshave applied quantitative structural or functional neuroimaging techniques. We will quantify structural and whitematter brain differences using MRI in pediatric CKD patients with mild to moderate non-glomerular CKDcompared to healthy controls; it will be the first study to utilize functional MRI sequences to characterize brainpH as a proxy of CKD-related metabolic disease. The study will use neurocognitive and laboratory assessmentin conjunction with neuroimaging correlates of brain structure and function in the pediatric CKD population. Ourhypotheses based on preliminary data predict volumetric and white matter differences will be observed in thecerebellums of CKD participants. These differences will involve integral cortico-thalamic-cerebellar whitematter tracts associated with executive function. We will investigate a dosage effect of disease burden oncerebellar volume and white matter development by evaluating a cross-sectional cohort of children with mild tomoderate CKD in comparison to healthy controls. Understanding the influence of pediatric CKDprogression and severity on the developing brain will allow enhanced awareness of the role of diseaseprogression specifically metabolic disease on neurodevelopmental outcomes in childhood andinform new approaches to treatment and patient education across the CKD lifespan. My clinical work inpediatric nephrology and introductory work with neuroimaging have laid a solid foundation for achieving thesegoals. Further training is necessary in sophisticated neuroimaging methods neurodevelopment and statistics.The proposed integrated research mentorship and didactic training programs combined with the outstandingresearch environment at the University of Iowa and off-site mentorship from faculty at Children's Hospital ofPhiladelphia will foster my long-term career objective to be an independent investigator studying brainstructure and function in pediatric CKD.","Academic achievement;Anemia;Awareness;Behavior;Behavior assessment;Bicarbonates;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cerebellum;Child;Childhood;Chronic Kidney Failure;Clinical;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Complex;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease;Disease Progression;Early Diagnosis;End stage renal failure;Environment;Faculty;Fostering;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Glomerular Filtration Rate;Goals;Graduation Rates;Growth;Image;Intelligence;Intervention;Iowa;Kidney;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Link;Longevity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award;Mentorship;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic acidosis;Metabolism;Methods;Nephrology;Neurocognitive;Neurocognitive Deficit;Normal Range;Outcome;PTH gene;Participant;Patient Education;Patients;Pediatric Hospitals;Performance;Philadelphia;Play;Population;Prevention;Process;Proxy;Publishing;Renal function;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Sampling;Serum;Severities;Site;Solid;Specificity;Structural Congenital Anomalies;Structural defect;Structure;System;Techniques;Thalamic structure;Training;Training Programs;Underachievement;Underemployment;Universities;Ursidae Family;Vitamin D;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;abstracting;base;boys;brain metabolism;burden of illness;career;cognitive function;cognitive task;cohort;dosage;driving force;emotion regulation;executive function;externalizing behavior;frontal lobe;high school;improved;motor control;neurodevelopment;neuroimaging;novel;novel strategies;pediatric patients;rho;routine care;statistics;white matter","Cognitive Profiles and Neuroimaging Correlates in Mild to Moderate Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease","Project NarrativeThe goal of this project is to characterize brain structure and function in pediatric patients with early chronickidney disease (CKD).

"Biotechnology; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS)","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a global urgency to develop a protective vaccine against HIV-1. Although neutralizing Abs (nAbs) can provide effective prophylaxis against HIV-1 acquisition eliciting those that are broadly reactive against many antigenically diverse HIV-1 isolates has been a major challenge and it remains a critical roadblock for AIDS vaccine development. The primary objective of this exploratory R21 application is to explore a novel vaccine strategy to elicit strong Ab responses against the CD4 binding site (CD4BS) of HIV-1 gp120 with an eventual goal of inducing broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs). This will be accomplished by using antigens complexed with specific monoclonal Abs (mAbs) with defined epitopes to mask immunogenic epitopes that induce non-neutralizing Abs and focus immune responses towards the CD4BS. The underlying principle behind this application is that the immunogenicity of antigens can be altered when they are bound to Abs. Furthermore how it is altered is determined by where the Abs bind. At present the functional relationship between B cell epitopes on gp120 and Ab's ability to alter humoral responses has not been fully delineated. Better understanding of this relationship could provide new insights towards developing more effective vaccine strategies. The specific hypotheses to be tested are: (1) the induction of non-neutralizing or strain-specific neutralizing Abs can be avoided or minimized by masking the epitopes using mAbs that bind to the very same epitopes; and (2) blocking highly immunogenic non-/strain-specific neutralizing epitopes while leaving the CD4BS fully exposed would force the immune system to focus Ab responses towards it; this would result in greater levels of CD4BS Abs some of which could be broadly neutralizing. The major innovations/strengths of our proposal are: (1) extensive experience in evaluating immunogenicity of HIV-1 antigens in rabbits; (2) a large library of rabbit mAbs which will allow us to test the hypotheses in rabbits;(3) preliminary data demonstrating proof-of-principle that immune-masking can suppress Ab responses^ (4) the usage of multiple mAbs to mask all (or most) non-/strain-specific neutralizing epitopes while allowing VRC01 to bind; and (5) the usage of low-pH sensitive mAbs that will release antigens in lysosomes for efficient antigen processing. Successful completion of proposed experiments would represent a major milestone towards development of a protective AIDS vaccine.      ","AIDS Vaccine Development;AIDS Vaccines;Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Affect;Affinity;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Antigens;B-Lymphocyte Epitopes;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Cessation of life;Cloning;Complex;Cover-up;Data;Development;Engineering;Enhancing Antibodies;Epitopes;Evaluation;Future;Glycoproteins;Goals;HIV Envelope Protein gp120;HIV-1;HIV-1 vaccine;Hybridomas;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunization;Infection;Killings;Left;Libraries;Lysosomes;Masks;Methodology;Modeling;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Positioning Attribute;Property;Prophylactic treatment;Testing;V3 Loop;Vaccines;Variant;Virus;antigen binding;antigen processing;experience;immunogenic;immunogenicity;innovation;insight;nonhuman primate;novel vaccines;pandemic disease;public health relevance;research study;response;vaccine development","Development of a vaccine strategy using antibody-complexed antigens","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: AIDS pandemic during the past three decades has killed an estimated 39 million people. In 2013 there were an estimated 1.5 million deaths 2.1 million new infections and 35 million people infected with HIVC1. A protective vaccine is the only economically feasible solution to end the pandemic. Abs that can neutralize (or block) HIVC1 infections are important components of the body's immune system. The critical roadblock to AIDS vaccine development is the difficulty in eliciting neutralizing Abs that are broadly reactive against many different variants of the virus that exist. The major goal of this proposal is to explore a novel vaccine strategy that could possibly induce broadly neutralizing Abs. Thus successful completion of the proposed studies will overcome a critical roadblock to AIDS vaccine development.      ","NIAID","9161293","3/7/2016","PA-13-303","1R21AI123266-01A1","1","R21","AI","123266","01","A1","SCHULTZ, ALAN M","3/10/2016","2/28/2018","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 AARR-M (02)]"," ","1926709","CHO, MICHAEL W","Not Applicable"," ","VETERINARY SCIENCES","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","US","42.022225","-93.639475","3974801","IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY","AMES","IA","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","500112025","UNITED STATES","N","3/10/2016","2/28/2017"," ","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","220422"," ","NIAID","150000","70422"," ","220422",
"Aging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Heart Disease; Nutrition; Obesity; Physical Activity; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARYAerobic exercise (AE) has well documented health benefits to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such asheart diseases or stroke. However there is very little evidence whether resistance exercise (RE) prevents CVDor modifies the development of CVD risk factors independent of and combined with AE. In fact the FederalPhysical Activity Guidelines primarily focus on AE for health. There remains an important unanswered question:What type or combination of exercise is most effective for CVD prevention? To answer this question the goalof this study Comparison of the Cardiovascular Benefits of Resistance Aerobic and Combined Exercise(Cardio-RACE) is to test the hypothesis that RE and AE have independent CVD benefits thus the combinedRE plus AE have greater additive benefits than either RE or AE alone. To achieve this goal the project includestwo specific aims:AIM 1: To explore the comparative effectiveness of RE AE and combined exercise on incident CVD risk factors(hypertension type 2 diabetes hypercholesterolemia and obesity) and CVD morbidity and mortality byanalyzing a large cohort data.AIM 2: To evaluate the independent and additive (combined) effects of RE and AE training on traditional andemerging CVD risk factors/markers (central hemodynamics inflammatory biomarkers glucose metabolismblood lipids adiposity sarcopenic indices and fitness) by conducting a randomized controlled trial of exercise.In Aim 1 the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study data in >34000 adults will be used. This is the largest cohortfollowed over 35 years with RE and objectively measured muscular strength. In Aim 2 400 adults at high riskof developing CVD will be recruited and randomized to one of four 1-year intervention groups: 1) RE trainingonly 2) AE training only 3) a combined RE plus AE training or 4) no training control. The proposed project willinvestigate mechanisms of how RE and AE training modify traditional and emerging CVD risk factors/markers(Aim 2) and further prevent CVD morbidity and mortality in the general population (Aim 1).This study could fill an important gap in our knowledge of the benefits of RE to further prevent CVD beyond thewell-documented benefits of AE. This project potentially contributes to developing more effective clinical andpublic health strategies to prevent CVD and advancing more comprehensive future physical activity guidelinesto support the mission of the National Institutes of Health.","Accelerometer;Activities of Daily Living;Adult;Aerobic;Aerobic Exercise;Biological Markers;Blood Pressure;Body fat;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cholesterol;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Data;Databases;Development;Diet;Diet Monitoring;Disease Outcome;Elderly;Exercise;Exercise intervention;Future;General Population;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Health Benefit;Heart Diseases;Hypertension;Immune response;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Knowledge;Link;Longitudinal Studies;Measures;Mediation;Mission;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Muscle;Myocardial Infarction;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Paper;Pathway interactions;Performance;Physical Fitness;Physical activity;Pilot Projects;Population;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Publishing;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recruitment Activity;Research;Resistance;Risk;Risk Factors;Running;Sports;System;Testing;Time;Training;United States National Institutes of Health;Weight Lifting;Work;aged;arterial stiffness;blood lipid;bone health;cardiorespiratory fitness;cardiovascular disorder prevention;cardiovascular disorder risk;cohort;comparative effectiveness;exercise training;fasting glucose;fitness;glucose metabolism;group intervention;hemodynamics;high risk;hypercholesterolemia;improved;indexing;inflammatory marker;mortality;peripheral blood;prevent;protective effect;resistance exercise;resistance mechanism;sarcopenia;strength training;stroke;weight maintenance","Comparison of the Cardiovascular Benefits of Resistance Aerobic and Combined Exercise (Cardio-RACE)","PROJECT NARRATIVEAerobic (cardio) exercise has well-documented health benefits.

"No NIH Category available","ABSTRACTWhat are the thermodynamic driving forces that influence the free energy of membrane protein folding andassembly in lipid bilayers? For soluble proteins the burial of hydrophobic groups away from aqueousinterfaces is a major driving force but membrane-embedded proteins cannot experience hydrophobic forcesas the lipid bilayer lacks water. A fundamental conundrum thus arises: how does a greasy protein surface findits greasy protein partner in the greasy lipid bilayer to fold faithfully into its native structure? Recently astructurally stable and functional monomeric form of the normally homodimeric Cl-/H+ antiporter CLC-ec1 wasdesigned by introducing tryptophan mutations at the dimer interface. We have used this to develop a newmodel system for studying reversible dimerization in membranes for free energy measurements whichsimplifies the protein folding process while still encompassing all of the thermodynamic properties of proteininteractions in the membrane environment. To quantify monomer vs. dimer populations across a wide range ofprotein per lipid mole ratios we developed (i) Frster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and (ii) single-molecule photo bleaching by total internal reflection microscopy in liposomes methods for the CLC-ec1 system.The sensitivity of single-molecule microscopy allows us to go to extremely dilute conditions where we observedissociation of CLC-ec1 in membranes. With measurements of the energetics already in place we willinvestigate two alternative hypotheses that have pervaded discourse in this field. First that protein associationis enthalpy-driven by van der Waals forces at highly complementary surfaces. Changes in free energy will bemeasured upon substitution of interface residues to alanine or tryptophan and efforts made to identify if VDWmotifs can be conferred to already destabilized constructs. The second hypothesis is that interactions aredriven by increased entropy of lipids upon subunit association. To study this the molecules forming the lipidsolvent will be modified by testing hydrophobic mismatch as a function of acyl chain length and also thedepletion-attraction force by changing lipid radius of gyration e.g. larger unsaturated and tetraether lipids vs.smaller non-polar general anesthetics. For all experiments free energy relationships will be measured as afunction of temperature to extrapolate enthalpy and entropy changes. This research will be carried out by ateam of interdisciplinary scientists in the Robertson laboratory with levels of training from graduate studentpostdoc research scientist and principal investigator combining expertise of membrane protein biochemistrysingle-molecule microscopy and computational modeling to provide an unlimited investigation into thisimportant biophysical question. The results from this study will provide a physical foundation for thedevelopment of informed strategies aimed at correcting protein mis-folding or regulating protein interactions inmembranes in physiologically and pathological situations.","Affect;Alanine;Amino Acid Substitution;Arachidonic Acids;Biological Models;Biophysics;Burial;CLC Gene;Cell membrane;Cellular biology;Chloroform;Complex;Computer Simulation;Development;Dimerization;Disease;Dissociation;Educational Status;Energy Transfer;Engineering;Entropy;Environment;Equilibrium;Escherichia coli;Fluorescence Microscopy;Foundations;Free Energy;General anesthetic drugs;Goals;Gray unit of radiation dose;Investigation;Laboratories;Length;Lipid Bilayers;Lipids;Liposomes;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Membrane;Membrane Lipids;Membrane Proteins;Membrane Transport Proteins;Methods;Microscopy;Modeling;Mole the mammal;Mutation;Outcomes Research;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Population;Postdoctoral Fellow;Principal Investigator;Process;Property;Protein Biochemistry;Protein Subunits;Proteins;Quality Control;Radial;Research;Role;Scientist;Side;Solvents;Structure;Study models;Surface;System;Temperature;Testing;Thermodynamics;Tryptophan;Water;Work;Xenon;antiporter;aqueous;crosslink;density;design;dimer;driving force;enthalpy;experience;graduate student;monomer;protein folding;protein misfolding;reconstitution;research study;single molecule;van der Waals force","Driving forces of membrane protein assembly in membranes","PROJECT NARRATIVEWhy do greasy membrane proteins choose to interact with greasy protein partners in the similarly greasy lipidmembrane?

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome","The overarching goal of this application is to create tools and efficient methods to definegenes that can promote human health. While a tremendous amount of data has been catalogedon gene mutation and changes in gene expression associated with complex human diseaseour understanding of those genes that could be co-opted to restore patient health is lacking. Toaddress this need and test for genes that when restored to wild type function promote healthwe propose develop mutagenic revertible and conditional alleles that provide spatial andtemporal control of gene expression. The ability to make site-specific untagged mutant allelesin zebrafish and other models has been greatly advanced by custom nucleases that includeTALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems. These systems operate on the same principle: they aredesigned to bind to specific sequences in the genome and create a double strand break. Thegoals of this proposal leverage the activities of TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to makesite-specific double strand breaks. First we propose to develop a suite of vectors to makeintegration alleles that are highly mutagenic and allow production of conditional and revertiblealleles. Second we propose to develop methods to generate predictable alleles in zebrafish atTALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-induced double strand break sites by invoking the microhomologymediated end-joining pathway. Third leveraging our preliminary data we propose to improvemethods for homology directed repair with oligonucleotides to create disease associated allelesin zebrafish and for site-specific integration using homologous recombination at TALENs andCRISPR/Cas9 cut sites. Fourth we propose use single-strand annealing at TALENs andCRISPR/Cas9 cut sites to promote precise transgene integration to make tagged and highlymutagenic allele. These tools and techniques will have direct implications for providing precisegene editing techniques to assess the roles of genes in disease and their ability to promotehealth following disease progression. While we will develop these methodologies in zebrafishdue to their ease of gene delivery we anticipate these methodologies will not only enhance theefficiency of gene editing but will be readily adaptable for use in other model organisms andlarge animals. In our opinion this will have important implications for modeling human diseaseand health in animal systems by greatly enhancing the ability to make predictible alleles smallnucleotide polymorphisms similar to those associated with human disease and conditionalalleles to test for the ability of a gene to restore health.","Address;Alleles;Animal Model;Animals;Area;Binding;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Models;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cataloging;Catalogs;Cells;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Custom;DNA;DNA Double Strand Break;Data;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Embryo;Gene Delivery;Gene Expression;Gene Mutation;Gene-Modified;Generations;Genes;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic screening method;Genome;Genome engineering;Genomics;Goals;Health;Human;Label;Laboratories;Machine Learning;Mediating;Methodology;Methods;Microinjections;Modeling;Modification;Mutagenesis;Mutate;Mutation;Nucleotides;Oligonucleotides;Operating System;Optics;Pathway interactions;Patients;Production;Proteins;Publications;Publishing;Reagent;Recording of previous events;Recovery;Regenerative Medicine;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Site;Staging;System;Systems Integration;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Tissues;Transgenes;Validation;Work;Zebrafish;cost;design;functional genomics;gene function;gene therapy;homologous recombination;human disease;improved;induced pluripotent stem cell;insight;interest;method development;mutant;nuclease;protein expression;recombinase;repaired;research study;site-specific integration;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;tool;tool development;transcription activator-like effector nucleases;vector","Development of tools for site-directed analysis of gene function","The central goal for this application is to define genes that can promote or restore humanhealth.

"No NIH Category available","The Mechanisms of Parasitism training program has been an ongoing program at the Universityof Iowa for 19 sequential years. The program unites scientists working on different microbial systemsand methods but addressing similar questions about Parasitism i.e. the pathogenesis of microbialdiseases. Thus this faculty provides trainees with an opportunity to address basic questionsregarding microbial pathogenesis using a full repertoire of techniques. Our underlying hypothesis isthat protozoal helminthic bacterial and viral pathogens face similar obstacles in overcomingmammalian antimicrobial defenses. The mechanisms through which one pathogen evades killingwithin the host may provide insights into means through which other pathogens survive in their uniquehost niche.

"Cardiovascular","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission of a request for continuation of our Institutional NRSA funded since 1975 for post-graduate training of MDs and PhDs in the University of Iowa Cardiovascular Research Center. All concerns of the Review Committee have been addressed in the Introduction. A large cadre of established investigators will serve as mentors for each of 13 trainees. Most of the 48 scientists who serve as primary mentors have been leaders and collaborators in major NIH funded research programs for several years. The research programs focus on 5 areas: Membrane Biology Ion Channels and Cell Signaling; Integrative Neurobiology and Sensory Signals in Cardiovascular Regulation; Endothelial/Vascular Biology Atherosclerosis Thrombosis and Cerebral Circulation; and Hypertension. Multidisciplinary themes and core resources cut across these major research areas. The emphasis is on basic clinical and translational research and a primary goal of an academic career. Most trainees will require from 4 to 6 years of advanced training in expectation of a career as independent investigators. A plan is outlined with support from this training grant for 1 to 3 years and the remaining years funded by institutional sources or other NIH foundation or American Heart Association career development programs. The trainees participate in seminars graduate courses bench research genomic and clinical research and epidemiologic surveys and biostatistics. Several courses will be mandatory for individuals seeking MS or PhD degrees and for all trainees in Responsible Conduct of Research. Our resources include the only medical school in the state of Iowa one of the largest University-owned hospitals the VA Medical Center a College of Public Health and a Cardiovascular Research Center of eminent national and international recognition. Our strengths are 1) the recruitment and retention of established investigators; 2) the cohesive interaction between basic scientists and clinical investigators providing an excellent environment for training of PhDs and MDs side by side; 3) the record of success in training outstanding cardiovascular scientists; and 4) the breadth and depth of research opportunities and superb institutional commitment. Several important new developments have positioned us very favorably to continue to provide an outstanding environment for training cardiovascular scientists. These are: the renewal of 5 major program project grants the creation of a new Institute for Clinical and Translational Research with a funded CTSA the building of a new Institute of Biomedical Discovery and the funding of a $25M endowment for research in diabetes and its cardiovascular consequences. In this renewal we place greater emphasis on multidisciplinary collaborations the link between basic and translational science mentoring and evaluations and recruitment of unrepresented minorities. The discovery of the causes of cardiovascular disease and of ways to prevent them and cure the patients who are suffering requires dedicated physicians and scientists to devote their lifelong work to a health mission without which a civilized society would not survive. Such individuals require years of training in medical science beyond their professional degree under the tutelage and mentoring of established senior medical investigators/teachers working in an environment with exceptional intellectual technical and physical resources. At the University of Iowa Cardiovascular Research Center we have provided a world-renowned training center since 1975 have graduated hundreds of scientists many of whom are national leaders throughout the USA and aim to continue to do so for future generations with the renewal of federal support that we are applying for and hope to attain.

Most children with pancreatitis have a single mild acute episode that resolves without complications. However a subset of children with AP develops recurrent episodes (defined as acute recurrent pancreatitis or ARP) and some progress to chronic pancreatitis (CP). Few studies have been performed to characterize ARP and CP in children. We recognized that the lack of a well-phenotyped pediatric cohort presented a major obstacle in understanding the pathophysiology of CP and its sequelae.

The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that pediatric CP has unique characteristics that determine disease onset and sequelae.

The overall innovation of the UI QIN site is accelerated deliverable tool generation accomplished through a successfully implemented cloud-like distributed workflow infrastructure. Our diversely talented and experienced interdisciplinary team includes oncologists nuclear medicine physicians radiologists physicists electrical and computer engineers bioinformaticists and statisticians. We propose the following new specific aims that build creatively from previous work in a highly innovative fashion and help accelerate QIN progress during this funding period: Specific Aim 1: Develop a novel robust imaging genomics-based decision support platform using a combination of our successful Phase-I developed and validated highly automated quantitative image analysis methods applied to linked and publically-available well curated image (TCIA) and molecular (TCGA) data warehouses along with an established outcomes database for H&N cancers. This will facilitate new methods necessary for future risk adaptive trials that will certainly include both genomic and quantitative image data. Specific Aim 2: Build and innovate based on Phase-I developed and validated image analysis tools: a) Apply highly and fully automated quantitative image analysis methods to a cooperative group data set of H&N cancers b) Develop unique new tools through creative new image analysis methods for application to FLT/PET in H&N cancer FLT/PET in pelvis and bone marrow as well as DOTATOC PET/CT for liver metastases in neuroendocrine cancers. These novel approaches will be made publicly available and will contribute to future clinical trials decision support quantitative imaging response assessment and therapy targeting in a variety of cancer sites. Specific Aim 3: Create a novel link between our established work in PET quantification and calibration phantoms with our image analysis and decision support tools to create a clinically practical open source automated phantom analysis tool that can be applied to national efforts aimed to improve quantitative imaging quality assurance for clinical trials acrossmultiple modalities including PET CT and MRI. This will provide a critical tool for improving theease accuracy and harmonization for clinical trials data acquisition. Specific Aim 4: Adapt enhance and extend quantitative image-based response assessment in clinical trial decision-support through relevant active clinical trials. Several clinical trials are highlighted exploring:1) FLT/PET as a predictor of bone marrow activity and toxicity in pelvic malignancies treated with chemoradiotherapy 2) DOTATOC as an indicator of disease burden and treatment response in neuroendocrine tumors and 3) quantitative MR imaging [T2 T1 T1 quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and MRSI] as effective predictors of response in malignant glial tumors treated with intravenous high dose vitamin C.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Mental Health; Muscular Dystrophy; Myotonic Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults is a multi-faceted genetic disease caused by CTG repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. Some of the primary symptoms are muscle myotonia and weakness yet patients and family members report that some of the most disabling symptoms of the disease are cognitive and behavioral. Therefore the involvement of the brain has recently come to attention and has prompted the scientific community to better understand the role of the brain in this disease. Neuroimaging studies in DM1 are very limited. Results of these studies are quite variable however what is consistent is that compared to controls white matter is particularly affected in DM1 subjects with decrements in cerebral white matter volume (WM) an increased number of white matter lesions (WML) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) measures which appear to be the most abnormal. Although these studies represent an increased interest in brain aspects of DM1 understanding the effects of DM1 on brain structure and function is still in its infancy. Lacking from the literature is a lage brain imaging study with a homogenous sample (adult onset only) combined with a comprehensive assessment of cognition motor and behavioral measures. In addition the neuromuscular aspects of DM1 are progressive and there is some evidence to suggest that the cognitive changes in DM1 are also progressive. However there is not one single study evaluating longitudinal changes in brain structure. This dearth of knowledge about the CNS effects of DM1 is in sharp contrast to where the field is moving in regard to therapeutics. The effectiveness of gene therapy using Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs) in treatment of an animal model of DM1 has been shown setting the stage for human trials which have already begun. In order for the field to be ready to begin any trials of CNS treatment in DM1 a substantial amount of work needs to be done. There is an urgent need for comprehensive baseline characterization of brain structure and function in order to identify biomarkers that are:1) disease-specific and clinically relevant; and 2) can track CNS disease progression. The overall aim of this study is to investigate the use of MRI measures of white matter health (WM WML DWI) as biomarkers of DM1 CNS disease. Subjects will undergo MRI scans and a comprehensive battery of cognitive motor and behavioral tests. Compared to matched healthy controls the DM1 subjects are hypothesized to have specific changes in measures of white matter health in brain imaging as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits. All subjects will be assessed at baseline and again at 1 and 2 year follow-ups. Evaluating brain measures over time will help to establish them as useful biomarkers of CNS progression making them vital tools for clinical trials in DM1.      ","Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Age;Animal Model;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Anxiety;Attention;Behavioral;Behavioral Symptoms;Biological Markers;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Brain imaging;Central Nervous System Diseases;Cerebrum;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cognition;Cognition Disorders;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Communities;DNA Sequence Alteration;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease;Disease Progression;Effectiveness;Enrollment;Evaluation;Family member;Genes;Health;Hereditary Disease;Heterogeneity;Human;Image;Knowledge;Length;Lesion;Literature;Longitudinal Studies;MRI Scans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mental Depression;Minor;Motor;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Myotonia;Myotonic Dystrophy;Neuraxis;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Patients;Peripheral;Protein Kinase;Reporting;Role;Sample Size;Sampling;Staging;Structure;Symptoms;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Visuospatial;White Matter Disease;Work;age related;behavior measurement;behavior test;clinically relevant;cognitive change;cognitive function;comparison group;disabling symptom;executive function;follow-up;gene therapy;illness length;infancy;interest;muscle strength;neuroimaging;neuromuscular;normal aging;processing speed;prospective;psychiatric symptom;public health relevance;sex;skills;tool;white matter","Longitudinal Assessment of Brain Structure and Function in Myotonic Dystrophy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study is a comprehensive prospective longitudinal study of brain structure and function in Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1).

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Radiation Oncology","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are considered an Orphan Disease with a low incidence (<10000/yr) in the United States. Consequently it has proven very difficult to secure the interest or resources needed to bring newer treatments to the clinical arena for these patients. Although slow to progress in the early stages once NETs metastasize the current 5-year survival rate is <30%. Newer more effective forms of therapy are urgently needed. Targeted radionuclide therapies using single agents such as 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I MIBG) and 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) have shown promise for therapy of small bowel NETs with response rates of 20-40%. Unfortunately complete responses are notably uncommon occurring in less than 10% of patients and response duration is often disappointing as well. We propose a Phase I clinical trial combining 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I MIBG that should provide an increase in the radiation dose delivered to tumors without exceeding safe limits for normal kidney and bone marrow. This trial design based on strong preliminary imaging data and radiation dose modeling has the potential to provide durable therapeutic benefit for patients with small bowel NETs where other therapeutic strategies fall short. In further basic science studies we propose an innovative strategy targeting unique G-protein coupled receptor hetero-dimers such as somatostatin receptor/dopamine receptor conjugates that are expressed in NETs. Preliminary data demonstrate that these new targeting agents have high affinity binding to tumor cells; they are predicted to be highly specific for tumor cells as the hetero-dimeric receptors are rarely expressed in normal tissues. Successful development of these unique radionuclide therapies will provide a new paradigm for molecular targeting and image-guided radionuclide therapy that will likely be translated to other malignancies.","90Y;Adult;Adverse effects;Affinity;Alternative Therapies;Apoptotic;Basic Science;Binding;Biological Assay;Bone Marrow;Carcinoid Tumor;Cell surface;Cells;Characteristics;Child;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Competitive Binding;Data;Development;Dopamine;Dopamine Receptor;Dose;Dose-Limiting;Drug Prescriptions;Drug resistance;Effectiveness;Europe;Fibroblasts;Future;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;GTP-Binding Proteins;Goals;Human;Image;In complete remission;Incidence;Kidney;Label;Lead;Length;Life;Ligands;Malignant Neoplasms;Marrow;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Midgut;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Necrosis;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Non-Malignant;Normal tissue morphology;Octreotide;Opioid;Organ;Pancreas;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptides;Pharmacodynamics;Phase I Clinical Trials;Property;Quality of life;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radio;Radioisotopes;Radiolabeled;Radionuclide therapy;Radiopharmaceuticals;Rare Diseases;Receptor Cell;Research;Resources;Secure;Small Intestines;Somatostatin;Somatostatin Receptor;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Staging;Survival Rate;Systemic Therapy;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Toxic effect;Translating;Treatment Protocols;United States;Work;base;chemotherapy;cohort;design;dimer;disorder control;effective therapy;evidence base;falls;image guided;improved;in vitro testing;innovation;interest;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular imaging;mortality;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;radiotracer;receptor;reduce symptoms;response;targeted agent;trial design;tumor","Project 4: New Approaches to Improving the Effectiveness of Radionuclide Targeted Treatments in Neuroendocrine Tumors","Upon successful completion of the proposed research we expect to have validated the use of [90Y]DOTATOC + [131I]MIBG in combination as a safe and potentially more effective radiopharmaceutical regimen for treatment of small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) under Aim 1.

We anticipate that together these studies will support new radio-therapeutic strategies for patients whose treatment is currently limited to single SSTR2 targeted radiolabeled peptides. These findings are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide strong evidence- based proof-of-principle for continued development and future clinical trials of dual-receptor dual-radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome","The incidence of Neuroendocrine Tumors (NETs) has increased five-fold over the last three decades and many patients do not develop symptoms until the tumors have metastasized. Although patients with these tumors may have prolonged survival despite advanced stage further understanding of the molecular biologic basis of NETs holds the promise for improved diagnosis imaging and therapy. We hypothesize that analyzing the gene expression profiles of these tumors and their exomes will allow us to identify important genes that will facilitate clinical advances for patients with these tumors. This contribution will be significant because it will allow us to determine the tumor site of origin in patients presenting with liver metastases and unknown primaries which will lead to more directed surgical exploration and resection; and knowledge of cell surface receptors or other genes significantly over-expressed in NETs relative to normal tissues will facilitate the development of new targets for detection imaging and medical management. Novel targets for therapy will also be suggested by the identification of frequently mutated or deleted genes in these tumors or the germline of patients with familial NETs.","Accounting;Cell Surface Receptors;Characteristics;Clinical;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic Imaging;Distant Metastasis;Excision;Family;Future;Gastrointestinal Neoplasms;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genomic approach;Germ-Line Mutation;Goals;Human;Image;Incidence;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical Imaging;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mutate;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pancreas;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Play;Primary Neoplasm;Proteins;RNA;Recording of previous events;Research;Role;Site;Small Intestines;Somatic Mutation;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Staging;Survival Rate;Susceptibility Gene;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Work;base;effective therapy;exome;exome sequencing;improved;innovation;insight;new therapeutic target;novel;novel diagnostics;novel therapeutic intervention;protein expression;receptor;research clinical testing;targeted treatment;transcriptome;treatment site;treatment strategy;tumor","Project 3: A Genomic Approach to Improved Diagnosis and Treatment of Neuroendocrine Tumors","Understanding the gene expression and mutational profiles of NETs represents an ideal opportunity for developing new diagnostic imaging and therapeutic modalities for these tumors.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Precision Medicine; Prevention; Rare Diseases","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are indolent malignancies that are increasing in incidence display profound resistance to conventional therapies and are a growing clinical challenge. Mechanisms underlying NET development are only partly understood and diagnostic / prognostic biomarkers of the disease are lacking. While progress in managing pancreatic NETs (PNETs) over the past several decades has been slow new targeted therapies such as mTOR inhibitors have emerged as we've learned more about molecular mechanisms of PNET pathogenesis. Mounting evidence suggests that greater benefits (improved efficacy and reduced resistance) will be obtained by targeting multiple steps of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Better understanding of PI3K/Akt/mTOR regulation and identification of PNET biomarkers that risk stratify patients into subgroups of those who will (or will not) respond to particular therapies will improve patient treatment. This project was developed with those goals in mind. Aim 1 builds upon our discovery that RABL6A (a novel oncoprotein) is essential for PNET cell survival and proliferation Akt/mTOR activity and control of other clinically relevant PNET pathways such as Rb1. Aim 2 which is based on pilot studies that identified several chromosomal alterations capable of discriminating pancreatic from ileal NETs (including RABL6A amplification on chr 9q) seeks to define new DNA and protein biomarkers that distinguish four different types of NETs (pancreatic ileal bronchial and cervical). The integration of findings from Aims 1 and 2 will establish novel relationships between the status of drug-targetable PNET pathways (RABL6A-Akt/mTOR RABL6A-Rb1) with genetic alterations that discriminate NET type and prognosis thus advancing clinical management of this disease. Aim 1. Define clinically relevant therapeutic targets that control PNET proliferation and survival. Aim 2. Identify genetic and proteomic biomarkers that discriminate NET type and prognosis. This research will identify molecular alterations that are common or unique to various types of NETs as well as primary versus metastatic tumors. Pilot studies have already identified RABL6A and other specific genetic alterations as strong candidate PNET biomarkers and proposed pre-clinical studies will determine the efficacy of unique drug combinations that target RABL6A effector pathways for reducing PNET burden. The most immediate clinical outcome of this translational project will be the development of fast and inexpensive genetic (FISH-based) and proteomic (IHC-based) tests for differentiating various types of NETs in patients. This should markedly improve NET diagnosis classification prognosis and treatment.","Automobile Driving;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biology;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;Cells;Cervical;Chromosome abnormality;Classification;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Management;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;DNA;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Drug Combinations;Drug Targeting;Excision;FRAP1 gene;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Freezing;Future;Gene Expression Profiling;Genetic;Genetic Markers;Genetic screening method;Goals;Human;Image;Immunohistochemistry;Incidence;Indolent;Islet Cell Tumor;Learning;Link;Location;Longevity;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Medical;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Microarray Analysis;Mind;Molecular;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal tissue morphology;Oncogenes;Oncogenic;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pancreas;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Primary Neoplasm;Prognostic Marker;Proteins;Proteomics;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Retinoblastoma Protein;Risk;SDZ RAD;Sampling;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Specimen;Study models;Subgroup;Testing;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Training;Treatment Protocols;Tumor Markers;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Work;base;clinically relevant;cohort;conventional therapy;diagnostic biomarker;effective therapy;genetic signature;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mouse model;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;novel diagnostics;novel drug combination;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;outcome forecast;patient stratification;pre-clinical;preclinical study;primary outcome;prognostic assays;protein biomarkers;therapeutic biomarker;therapeutic target;tumor","Project 2: Molecular Mechanisms and Biomarkers of Neuroendocrine Tumors","The molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) is poorly understood and NET biomarkers are lacking.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Digestive Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) constitute an unrecognized health threat to children and adults. The incidence and prevalence of NETs is rising in the United States; yet there is very little research on NETs and no effective treatment for patients with metastatic disease over half of whom die within five years of diagnosis according to latest SEER data. These tumors do not respond to conventional chemotherapy or external beam radiation making development of new diagnostic and therapeutic options imperative. We hypothesize that theranostics use of a single compound as both a therapeutic and a diagnostic agent will meet this critical need for children and adults with NETs. The translational component of this proposal will identify new theranostic targets design and synthesize new targeting agents and test their efficacy in vivo. Lead compounds that meet strict criteria as high affinity PET tracers and molecularly targeted therapeutic agents in pre-clinical models of bronchial small bowel or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors will be brought forward to  first in human PET imaging trials through an Exploratory IND mechanisms. Specific aims are: 1. Design and synthesize unique high-affinity stable ligands for use in GPCR targeted theranostics. Expression data from Project 3 has identified three GPCR (OXTR VPAC1 MC1R) as new targets in NETs. Theranostic radiopharmaceuticals will be designed and synthesized using NMR and 3-D modeling to guide chemical modifications that enhance affinity specificity and stability of candidate ligands. Peptide libraries incorporating D- and unnatural amino acids cyclization strategies and lysine substitutions for DOTA conjugation will be synthesized; binding affinity specificity and stability will be determined in vitro. 2. Characterize in vivo specificity stability pharmacokinetics and cytotoxicity of new GPCR targeted theranostic compounds in mouse models of neuroendocrine tumors. We will conduct theranostic pre- clinical in vitro and in vivo testing of lead GPCR targeted ligands in mouse models of NETs with the goal of having at least two analogs ready to test as PET tracers in humans by year 5. 3. Examine safety and efficacy of new GPCR targeted PET tracers in humans using exploratory IND. Agents that pass rigorous pre-clinical testing will then be synthesized under GMP conditions.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diagnostic Radiology; Radiation Oncology","The Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor SPORE Clinical Research Core (CRC) has as its primary goal to enable each project to bring the fruit of its scientific research to a clinical end point that will benefit patients both proximally and in the future. The Clinical Research Core is the direct translational link between research projects and clinical research emanating from these projects. This Core is directed by Thomas M. O'Dorisio MD with Daniel Vaena MD and Terry Braun PhD as co-directors; these directors are all members of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Core are to: 1) Continue to consent and enroll patients into the Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry and to  further develop the Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Database 2) Coordinate and perform SPORE clinical trials protocols. The CRC will provide a critical link  between clinical research and the projects cores and developmental research projects; 3) Review validity of and coordinate incorporation of new genetic pathologic and imaging tests developed by Projects into new clinical trials. Aim 1. The CRC obtains consent from newly diagnosed and referred patients with NETs abstracts and enters clinical and epidemiologic data into the Neuroendocrine Tumor Database (REDCap) and systematically manages and treats patients through death. Tumor tissue and peripheral blood serum cells DNA and RNA are prospectively collected stored and tracked in LabMatrix"" by the Biospecimens Core for linkage to the database. This provides integrated and centralized access to SPORE investigators for NET research projects. The Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Clinic and Registry were established by Dr. O'Dorisio in 2000 and over 1300 subjects (and family members) with NETs have been consented to this Registry. Aim 1 goals are to continue to recruit new patients to participate in the Registry and to continually maintain update and upgrade the databases that support the Registry. Patient data from each visit is entered regularly. Aim 2. Iowa SPORE investigators have been active in design and conduct of both investigator-initiated and NCI cooperative group trials for patients with NETs. These trials have encompassed imaging and dosimetry trials therapeutic trials of new targeted biologicals and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT); and the only Phase I trial of PRRT for children and adolescents. Key functions of the CRC in Aim 2 are to coordinate the development of clinical trials assist in patient accrual manage IRB consents and amendments for protocols report adverse events to appropriate agencies and provide comprehensive quality control (e.g. monitor for protocol deviations & clinical trial data performance). Aim 3. As suggested by reviewers the CRC will facilitate incorporation of recent scientific SPORE advances into SPORE clinical trials. Projects 1 2 3 and 4 are poised to develop new imaging agents genetic tests and immunohistochemistry panels. The CRC will guide and assist investigators in obtaining FDA approval for new agents and tests. CRC will then aide in incorporation of FDA approved advances into clinical practice.","90Y;Adolescent;Adverse event;Amendment;Biological;Cells;Cessation of life;Child;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical trial protocol document;Collection;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Consent;DNA;Data;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Distant Metastasis;Doctor of Philosophy;Enrollment;FDA approved;Family;Family member;Fruit;Future;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Markers;Genetic screening method;Goals;Heart;Human;Image;Immunohistochemistry;Industry;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;Iowa;Isotope Therapy;Laboratories;Link;Long-Term Care;Malignant Neoplasms;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Molecular Target;Monitor;Neuroendocrine Tumors;New Agents;Newly Diagnosed;PET/CT scan;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Receptor;Peptides;Performance;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Preparation;Prognostic Marker;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;Quality of life;RNA;Radiation therapy;Radionuclide therapy;Records;Recruitment Activity;Regional Disease;Registries;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Scientist;Serum;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Specimen;Symptoms;System;Testing;Therapeutic Trials;Time;Tissue Microarray;Translational Research;Tumor Tissue;United States;Update;Visit;abstracting;clinical practice;design;diagnostic biomarker;disorder prevention;dosimetry;epidemiologic data;follow-up;imaging agent;member;metaiodobenzylguanidine;molecular pathology;novel diagnostics;patient population;peripheral blood;phase I trial;programs;theranostics;therapeutic target;treatment response;tumor registry","Core C - Clinical Research","Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have few opportunities to participate in clinical trials due to the scarcity of NCI sponsored investigator-initiated or cooperative group trials for these rare malignancies.

"Cancer; Clinical Research","The Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor (NET) SPORE Biospecimens Core provides a coordinated centralized and dedicated core for the procurement processing and annotation of biospecimens from patients in our Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry and also from SEER Residual Tissue Repositories. The primary goal of the Biospecimens Core is to procure a variety of biologic specimens on patients with neuroendocrine tumors. These specimens will include fresh or rapidly frozen specimens from patients who have signed the Iowa NET Registry consent as well as de-identified formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens obtained through the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) residual tissue repository (RTR). All specimens will be tracked and stored under conditions that optimize their utility for molecular studies assuring the Iowa NET SPORE investigators have access to a large number of a wide variety of NET tumor normal and germline specimens. All biospecimens will be collected tracked and distributed to SPORE researchers following the established protocols of the Iowa Tumor Procurement Core (TPC) in the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center (HCCC) and the Iowa SEER. All specimens are collected and processed under tight quality control tracked and distributed to SPORE researchers or banked for future SPORE research projects. The Core tracks the acquisition distribution and results obtained on these specimens allowing integration with clinical and other data collected in research projects. The Core benefits from the expertise in the HCCC but does not duplicate its services. The Core supports each of the full and developmental projects. There has been extensive utilization of these biospecimens with resulting clinical and phenotypic data already in our Iowa NET Database. We will continue to accrue new patient samples as well as repository FFPE specimens and will continually work with investigators to utilize this increasingly valuable resource for these orphan tumors. Specific Aims of the Biospecimens Core are: 1) Collect process bank and distribute excess surgical specimens and/or blood/buccal swabs from patients and family members who have signed consent to participate in the Iowa NET Registry; 2) Acquire process and distribute de-identified neuroendocrine tumor FFPE specimens obtained through the Iowa Virtual Tumor Repository and SEER Residual Tissue Repository; 3) Provide accurate diagnosis and grade on all tumor specimens according to North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS) guidelines; 4) Work with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core to maintain data obtained from Iowa NET Registry biospecimens and SEER Repository biospecimens to further collaborative research leading to improved long term outcomes for patients with NETs.","American;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biometry;Biopsy;Blood;Blood specimen;California;Classification Scheme;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Research;Complex;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Consent;DNA;Data;Databases;Development;Diagnosis;Family member;Formalin;Freezing;Future;Gene Expression;Goals;Guidelines;Hawaii;Health;Human;Institution;Iowa;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical Surveillance;Molecular;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Normal tissue morphology;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orphan;Paraffin;Paraffin Embedding;Pathologist;Pathology Report;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Plasma;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Quality Control;RNA;Registries;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Residual state;Resources;Sampling;Secure;Services;Site;Societies;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Specimen;Staging;Swab;Tissue Microarray;Tissues;Translating;Tumor Tissue;Universities;Work;accurate diagnosis;exome sequencing;improved;meetings;patient registry;phenotypic data;repository;tumor;tumor registry;virtual","Core B - Biospecimens","Well-characterized pathologically and clinically annotated tumor tissues from patients with neuroendocrine tumors are a critical and valuable resource for translating the basic molecular and biological understanding of neuroendocrine tumors into improved treatments for these patients.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY The 20th century brought the chemical revolution and the steady increase of large scale production of chemicals. Only later did the problem of environmental persistence of some of these new and useful chemicals become evident and only recently did we discover the magnitude of the negative health effects of these persistent pollutants ranging from an involvement in the increase in brain diseases and metabolic syndrome to cancer fertility problems reduced function of the immune system and even hearing loss and autism. Moreover these pollutants may volatilize contaminate indoor and outdoor air and travel large distances across borders and continents. Meanwhile society must deal with these legacy contaminants inform affected populations protect humans and the environment and prevent ongoing and future contamination. To be successful environmental health and engineering professionals have to deal with these problem chemicals in multiple dimensions. The traditional training approach designed to produce specialized experts in individual narrow disciplines is clearly inappropriate to prepare trainees for leadership roles in environmental health and technology. Instead future scientists and engineers need thorough training in their specific fields basic knowledge about socioeconomic legal engineering and science aspects outside their fields and an ability to communicate and cooperate with specialists in other disciplines and with various stakeholders and affected groups. The goal of the Training Core of the Iowa Superfund Research Program (isrp) is to prepare students through holistic cross-disciplinary training ""Without Borders"" for these challenges. To achieve these goals the Training Core strives to: 1) recruit excellent highly motivated trainees into Superfund research 2) promote cross disciplinary didactic education 3) support existing and the development of new interdisciplinary research by trainees and 4) provide trainees with experiences beyond the curriculum and research to prepare them for a successful transition into professional life and ability to effectively interact with diverse audiences. In the last funding circle (2010-now) 52 graduate students and 20 postdocs obtained such training (26 of these are still ongoing). This was possible because of the established successful and supportive collaborations among the isrp faculty members who represent diverse areas of expertise such as toxicology occupational & environmental health free radical biology medicinal pharmacology environmental engineering and urban & regional planning. In addition the Training Core is blessed with significant support from the Graduate College of the University of Iowa. The outstanding achievements of our students and postdocs in the years since this isrp was founded and the exceptional diversity of isrp trainees including minorities and a multitude of ethnicities and nationalities demonstrate that the Core is achieving its mission of training the scientists and engineers for the 21st century who work across all borders to solve the problems of hazardous chemicals.","Achievement;Affect;Air;Area;Autistic Disorder;Biology;Brain Diseases;Breeding;Chemicals;Chemistry;Collaborations;Development;Dimensions;Discipline;Educational Curriculum;Engineering;Environment;Environmental Engineering technology;Environmental Health;Ethnic Origin;Faculty;Fertility;Floods;Free Radicals;Funding;Future;Goals;Hazardous Chemicals;Health;Health Technology;Human;Immune system;Individual;Interdisciplinary Study;Iowa;Knowledge;Leadership;Legal;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Metabolic syndrome;Minority;Mission;Nationalities;Occupational Health;Pharmacology;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Postdoctoral Fellow;Principles of law and justice;Problem Solving;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Science;Scientist;Societies;Source;Specialist;Students;Superfund;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Training;Travel;Universities;Work;college;design;didactic education;experience;graduate student;hearing impairment;large scale production;member;pollutant;prevent;programs;social;socioeconomics","Cross-Disciplinary Training ""Without Borders"" Training Core","NARRATIVE Our lives have become so much safer and more convenient through chemistry but the flood of new mass produced chemicals and of persistent and potentially harmful legacy compounds require a new breed of experts for chemical stewardship scientists and engineers that are experts in their field but can understand and work with colleagues from other fields communicate with stakeholders and affected populations and understand social and legal aspects.

"Endocrine Disruptors; Pediatric","PROJECT SUMMARY The potential hazardous effects of inhalation exposure to semi-volatile PCBs in ambient and indoor environ- ments have caused growing concern and demonstrated the need for research in inhalation toxicology of airborne PCBs. The paucity of data on metabolism excretion and dose-specific toxicologic effects has been the main barrier to meaningful human health risk assessment of inhaled PCBs especially of the non-legacy semi-volatile PCBs. In this grant cycle the former Inhalation Toxicology Core is elevated to project status in recognition of the formative and highly innovative research this group has performed. Project 7 is highly integrated with other projects and cores of the Iowa Superfund Research Program (isrp) and will continue to provide tissues blood and excreta from inhalation-exposed animals and controls. As a project this research team will expand the body of knowledge on inhaled PCBs using innovative exposure systems and methodol- ogy developed in the last cycle. We will conduct studies to identify adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for inhaled environmentally-relevant PCB mixtures and identify both the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL). We will test multiple dose levels using a congener profile that we have demonstrated represents the Chicago airshed. The study will for the first time reduce uncertainties in the inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for risk assessment and present an extensive dose-dependent evaluation of AOPs. Adverse outcomes measured in adult rats and mice will be further investigated in prenatal exposure studies recognizing the enhanced susceptibility of pregnancy and the developing fetus. In addition collaboration with other projects of the isrp will provide mechanistic insights on how molecular and cellular processes respond in those pathways. Over the past 5 years our publications have begun to fill what was a near total void on the biological fate of inhaled PCBs. We will continue to elucidate the absorption distribution metabolism and excretion (ADME) of predominant airborne PCBs using 14C-labelled congeners. Our central hypothesis is that even though inhaled environmental PCBs are susceptible to relatively fast elimination inhalation exposure to rodents at current human equivalent concentrations will result in adverse health effects and measureable toxicity. Three specific aims will be addressed: AIM 1) Conduct inhalation studies using our Chicago Air Mixture (CAM+) to identify adverse outcome pathways and derive in vivo data for an integrated risk assessment; AIM 2) Conduct ADME toxicology studies with lung exposure to radiolabelled tetra- and penta- chlorobiphenyls to provide data for toxicokinetic modeling; and AIM 3) Investigate developmental immune and neurologic toxicity after prenatal inhalation exposure to airborne PCBs (CAM+) at the LOAEL.

"Clinical Research; Nutrition; Pediatric; Rural Health","PROJECT SUMMARY The AESOP Study (Airborne Exposures to Semi-volatile Organic Pollutants) is a community-based participa- tory research study that assesses exposures and body burdens of atmospheric PCBs among an urban cohort of children and their mothers in an area contaminated with legacy PCBs and where dredging of 3.5 million m3 of PCB-laden sediments is now underway. Airborne PCB exposures plus serum and urine levels of PCBs and metabolites are assessed and compared to levels in the cohort before the dredging began as well as to a rural Iowa cohort in an area without legacy PCBs. The AESOP Study is identifying the determinants of PCB expo- sures among children and their mothers including exposure levels indoors and out dietary intake and other exposure pathways. The Study is also determining how we can best monitor exposures and metabolites. The Specific Aims are: 1: Maintain the urban and rural residential cohorts in East Chicago and Columbus Junction and gather demographic residential occupational activity dietary and baseline health data from subjects; 2: Collect air samples inside and outside at homes and schools and measure congener-specific concentrations of atmospheric PCBs; 3: Collect blood annually from all subjects and measure PCB congeners and congener- specific metabolites in serum samples and report these values to participants; 4: Collect urine from all subjects and measure congener-specific PCB sulfate metabolites and evaluate the efficacy of urine as a biomarker for exposure to lower-chlorinated congeners; and 5: Model exposures and body burdens for the atmospheric PCB congeners from the cohorts and compare modeled and measured data. These aims are facilitated by strong community support garnered through our Community Engagement Core and aided by sample analyses performed in our Analytical Core. The AESOP Study employs bilingual community-based field staff and has enrolled and followed 264 subjects in these racially and ethnically diverse communities (59% Hispanic 23% Black 18% other) and provided new insight into airborne exposures and resulting body burdens. Exposures have been assessed through repeated air sampling inside and outside of homes of subjects and at their local schools and also through annual blood collection and assay for PCB congener and metabolite profiles. The AESOP Study provides human samples and data to other components of the Iowa Superfund Research Program providing enhanced relevance. In this renewal cycle we will evaluate in greater detail the diet of our subjects using established methodology. This dietary information will be used along with inhalation data and activity logs for integrated exposure modeling. The AESOP Study has changed prevailing views on how most Americans are exposed to PCBs. We have demonstrated that our subjects have substantial exposure to PCB congeners from inhalation in addition to ingestion and their blood shows enrichment with inhaled lower- chlorinated congeners. This has important implications for children's environmental health.","Address;Air;American;Americas;Area;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Monitoring;Blood;Blood specimen;Body Burden;Breathing;Chicago;Child;Collection;Communities;Consumption;Data;Data Reporting;Data Set;Data Sources;Databases;Decision Making;Diet;Diet Surveys;Dietary intake;Eating;Enrollment;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollution;Excision;Exposure to;Food;Hispanics;Home environment;Human;Indiana;Individual;Ingestion;Inhalation Exposure;Inorganic Sulfates;Iowa;Left;Location;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Mothers;NHANES;Occupational;Participant;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Process;Program Research Project Grants;Questionnaires;Reporting;Research;Risk;Route;Rural;Sampling;Schools;Serum;Shipping;Ships;Site;Source;Study Subject;Superfund;Teenagers;Time;Tissue Sample;Toxic effect;Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates;Urine;Variant;air sampling;base;bilingualism;cohort;community based participatory research;ethnic diversity;exposed human population;exposure pathway;health data;high school;improved;in vivo;indoor exposure;insight;junior high school;liquid chromatography mass spectrometry;pollutant;programs;racial diversity;research study","Project 6: Airborne Exposures to Semi-volatile Organic Pollutants (The AESOP Study)","PROJECT NARRATIVE The AESOP Study (Project 6) is a community-based research study that is determining the extent and routes of exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) arising from legacy and non-legacy environmental pollution and indoor air contamination among teenagers and their mothers in East Chicago Indiana and Columbus Junction Iowa.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of Project 5 is to provide engineering research (non-biomedical) for the remediation of sites containing typical airborne PCB congeners that may expose humans. Specifically it is to determine whether plants can provide in situ phytoremediation of lesser-chlorinated PCB congeners from soil and groundwater sources like the municipal wastewater lagoon at Altavista Virginia. Thus the Project focuses on PCB congeners of higher volatility which comprise significant mass toxicity and persistence in the environment. Plants can uptake PCB congeners from soil and sediments intercept semi-volatile congeners from the air onto the waxy cuticle of leaves and bark and metabolize contaminants within plant tissues. In addition plants can stimulate rhizosphere bioremediaton of PCBs by providing the habitat redox potential and substrates necessary for microbial biodegradation in the root zone. The significance of this project is to provide the scientific and engineering basis for development of land management strategies that can be used to intervene and clean PCB-contaminated sites. Four specific aims comprise Project 5: Aim #1. Identify plant metabolites of selected PCB congeners (PCB 11 52 77 101 126 153) that are semi- volatile persistent and toxic; and also the uptake/selectivity/metabolism of chiral compounds (PCB 91 and 95). Aim #2. Elucidate the regulation of metabolism of PCBs by poplar plants (Populus trichocarpa) at the epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Aim #3. Identify microorganisms and functional genes associated with PCB dechlorination in enrichment cultures derived from PCB-contaminated soil and in un-enriched PCB-contaminated sediment. Aim #4. Characterize PCB-induced changes by plants and their associated rhizosphere microorganisms at a contaminated site (Altavista Virginia) and in contaminated sediments using gene sequencing and transcriptomic responses. Our leading themes are to identify plant metabolites and microbial dechlorination processes in rhizosphere soils and sediments. We strive to understand the biochemical mechanisms necessary for full-scale phytoremediation of PCBs and the subsequent reduction of exposure at contaminated sites.","Affect;Air;Bacteria;Biochemical;Biodegradation;Bioremediations;Biota;Collaborations;Communities;Development;Elements;Engineering;Environment;Epigenetic Process;Exposure to;Exudate;Food Chain;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Goals;Habitats;Human;Hybrids;In Situ;Industry;Intercept;Intervention;Iowa;Isomerism;Laboratories;Metabolism;Metagenomics;Molecular;Optics;Oxidation-Reduction;Plant Roots;Plants;Poaceae;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Populus;Process;Public Health;Regulation;Research;Risk;Site;Soil;Source;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Translating;Translational Research;Trees;Universities;Virginia;analytical method;base;dechlorination;exposed human population;microbial;microorganism;remediation;response;transcriptomics;uptake","Project 5: Phytoremediation to Degrade Airborne PCB Congeners from Soil and Groundwater Sources","PROJECT NARRATIVE Project 5 utilizes engineering research (non-biomedical) to provide the scientific basis for remediating contaminated sites and reducing exposure to humans by PCBs and metabolites.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of Project 4 is to better understand the relationship between the observed concentrations in air and sources of airborne PCBs and their breakdown products in ambient and indoor environments. Project 4 provides a path for significant and measureable reduction of human risk through exposure to PCBs and their breakdown products through significant and measureable improvements in the ability to detect predict and attribute these compounds and to assess airborne exposure risks. We further propose to identify the ability of contemporary PCB mitigation methods to reduce population-scale airborne exposure to PCBs. The central hypothesis for Project 4 is that emissions of airborne PCBs and their breakdown products are a function of measureable and quantifiable characteristics of the compounds and environmental matrices on which PCBs reside. A corollary hypothesis is that the effectiveness of remediation efforts is dependent on the successful identification and quantitative characterization of emission sources. The aims of Project 4 are organized around field studies state-of-the-art analytical tools and environmental modeling in urban and rural ambient outdoor and indoor environments to quantify sources emissions chemical transport exposure and fate. The aims of Project 4 are the following: Aim 1: Determine sources of airborne Aroclor and non-Aroclor congeners in urban air. Measurements of airborne PCBs and OH-PCBs; development of chemical transport models; and assessment geographic databases will be used to achieve this aim. Aim 2: Characterize the release of airborne PCBs in the Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal. Measurements of PCBs and OH-PCBs in sediment water and air; laboratory experiments that reproduce environmental conditions; and chemical mass balance modeling will be conducted. Aim 3: Identification of sources of PCB congeners in indoor air. This aim includes determination of PCB congeners in building materials and manufacturing processes that produce PCBs found in homes. Aim 4: Determination of physical-chemical properties of PCB breakdown products. Laboratory experiments and computational models will be utilized to determine equilibrium and kinetic constants of these compounds.","Address;Affect;Air;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Characteristics;Chemicals;Chicago;Cities;Communities;Computer Simulation;Databases;Development;Dyes;Effectiveness;Engineering;Environment;Equilibrium;Exposure to;Fiber;Goals;Home environment;Household;Human;Indiana;Individual;Indoor environment;Iowa;Kinetics;Knowledge;Laboratories;Manufacturer Name;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Michigan;Modeling;Monitor;Octanols;Paint;Pigments;Poisons;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Production;Property;Risk;Rural;Rural Community;Sampling;Schools;Shipping;Ships;Source;Surface;Testing;Toxic effect;Tribes;Uncertainty;United States Environmental Protection Agency;Washington;Water;air sampling;analytical tool;building materials;chemical property;computational chemistry;consumer product;disease registry;exposed human population;field study;improved;laboratory experiment;landfill;manufacturing process;remediation;sound;water quality","Project 4: Atmospheric Sources of PCB Congeners","PROJECT NARRATIVE Project 4 will promote more scientifically-sound and effective action to reduce human exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and breakdown products by identifying major sources of these compounds in ambient and indoor air in urban and rural communities; by quantifying the emissions due to release of PCB mixtures historically produced commercially and now found in the sediments of industrial harbors landfills and electrical storage facilities; by quantifying emissions that originate with chemical manufacturing processes commonly used for household paint pigments and other contemporary building materials and commercial products; and providing alternatives to current practices that would cause significant reduction in PCB emissions.

"Endocrine Disruptors","PROJECT SUMMARY Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) continue to persist in our environment and are linked to multiple threats to human health. Of most recent concern is the ongoing contamination by volatile PCBs in both outdoor and indoor air as a result of their presence in older buildings (e.g. public schools) at sites near legacy pollution with PCBs and due to current inadvertent industrial production of these agents. PCBs with lower numbers of chlorine atoms are more volatile and are also more readily metabolized. Such metabolism may result in either detoxication or creation of more toxic metabolites. Project 3 is focused on the interactions of hydroxylated metabolites derived from PCBs with mammalian cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs). Hydroxylated PCBs (OH- PCBs) may serve as either substrates for sulfation catalyzed by SULTs or inhibitors of the physiological sulfation reactions that these enzymes catalyze. The long term goal of Project 3 is to understand the relationships between human SULTs and toxic responses to the lower chlorinated PCBs present in air. A central hypothesis for the upcoming project period is that SULTs catalyze the sulfation of hydroxylated metabolites of the major lower chlorinated PCBs found in air samples and that the resulting PCB sulfates have biological effects that include transport to relevant tissues via serum proteins and alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations and/or steroid hormone sulfation. We have determined that lower chlorinated PCB sulfates are high affinity ligands for the thyroxine-binding site on transthyretin. Previous studies also indicate that OH-PCBs can either inhibit or serve as substrates for hSULT2A1 and hSULT1E1 enzymes that function to inactivate steroid hormones via sulfation. During the upcoming project period we will: 1) identify the specificities of key enzymes catalyzing the sulfation of physiological steroids with respect to their interactions with OH-PCB and PCB sulfate metabolites of the most frequently detected PCBs in air samples 2) determine the binding affinities of PCB sulfates with serum thyroid hormone transport proteins evaluate the potential for alteration of thyroid hormone concentrations and determine the distribution of PCB sulfates to relevant tissues and 3) evaluate the enzymatic potential for metabolic generation of PCB sulfates in humans and relate this to concentrations of sulfated PCB metabolites in human serum and urine samples. We believe that the proposed studies are highly innovative due to the fact that the sulfated metabolites of PCBs have been an overlooked class of metabolites of these environmental contaminants. Moreover high affinity of some of these PCB sulfates for thyroxine-binding sites on serum proteins may facilitate transport to tissues with subsequent toxicological effects. The proposed research in this project is highly interactive with multiple projects and cores of the Iowa Superfund Research Program and the results to be forthcoming will yield new insights that will be important in achieving the center-wide goals relating to evaluation and prioritization of risks associated with airborne PCBs.","Accounting;Affinity;Air;Androgens;Attention;Binding;Binding Proteins;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biological;Breathing;Carrier Proteins;Chlorine;Data;Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution;Endocrine;Environment;Environmental Pollution;Enzymes;Estrogens;Evaluation;Exposure to;Family;Generations;Goals;Grant;Health;Hepatic;Hormones;Human;Inorganic Sulfates;Iowa;Knowledge;Ligands;Link;Liver;Mammals;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Modeling;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Phenols;Physiological;Poisons;Pollution;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Positioning Attribute;Prealbumin;Production;Rattus;Reaction;Regulation;Research;Risk;Role;Sampling;Schools;Serum;Serum Proteins;Signal Transduction;Site;Source;Specificity;Steroids;Superfund;Thyroid Hormones;Thyroxine;Tissues;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Training;Translational Research;United States Environmental Protection Agency;Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates;Urine;air sampling;detoxication;disease registry;exposed human population;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;member;predictive modeling;programs;protein transport;response;steroid hormone;steroid sulfotransferase;sulfation;sulfotransferase","Project 3: PCBs and Cytosolic Phenol and Steroid Sulfotransferases","PROJECT NARRATIVE The research to be conducted in Project 3 will determine the role(s) of cytosolic sulfotransferases in the formation and toxicology of sulfated metabolites derived from those PCBs most frequently encountered in indoor and outdoor air samples.

"Dietary Supplements; Genetics; Nutrition; Prevention","PROJECT SUMMARY Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 individual congeners that differ widely in their toxic effects and mechanisms of toxicity. Most research has focused on the effects of higher chlorinated PCBs because they bioaccumulate. However exposure to lower chlorinated more volatile biphenyls through contaminated indoor and outdoor air can be very high for some populations. These airborne PCBs are readily bio-activated and exhibit their own distinct spectra of toxic effects. We hypothesize that airborne PCBs can bring about inappropriate changes in the redox status and macromolecule function of cells and tissues through different distinct mechanisms leading to detrimental effects on health and that through understanding these mechanisms strategies to ameliorate these health effects can be designed. The discoveries we have made in the previous funding periods have fundamentally changed views on the toxicity of PCBs. Our data provided key information for the reclassification of PCBs to Group 1 human carcinogens by the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC). Our new discoveries supply the foundation for the proposed research in this renewal application. To address the hypothesis of Project 1 we will study PCBs occurring most often in air and their metabolites to: 1) provide an in-depth analysis of the disruptions in the redox networks redox environment and basic energy metabolism-respiration of cells and tissues upon exposure; 2) identify the active congeners/metabolites to elucidate structure-activity relationships of (geno)toxicity ranking them in importance and potential consequences to human health; 3) identify sensitive target tissues analyze organ specificity and determine threshold levels and toxicity; 4) examine the potential of dietary approaches to prevent or ameliorate toxicity; and 5) assess human mother-child samples with known PCB and metabolite body burdens to develop biomarkers of exposure and effects and to identify potential susceptible subpopulations. Our principal goal is to gain new knowledge that will enable data-driven risk assessment as well as chemo- protective and therapeutic methods to prevent or ameliorate the detrimental effects of PCBs and other toxicants. Our approach is integrative and diverse ranging from fundamental physical chemistry to detailed analysis of effects at the `molecule per cell' level to dissection of the interactions between different congeners of PCBs effects of micronutrients and analysis of human samples to determine consequences of exposure. With a clear focus on our goals this research program meets exceptionally well the mission of the Superfund Research Program pushing the boundaries of science with a view to the future for effective hazard management and health protection.","Address;Adolescence;Air;Animal Model;Antioxidants;Biochemistry;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Blood;Blood specimen;Body Burden;Breathing;Carcinogens;Cell Respiration;Cell physiology;Cells;Chemoprotection;Chicago;Child;Chronic;Collaborations;Communities;Consumption;DNA;DNA Damage;Data;Development;Dissection;Energy Metabolism;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Pollutants;Enzymes;Excision;Exhibits;Exposure to;Family;Fertilization;Foundations;Funding;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Glutathione Disulfide;Glycolysis;Goals;Grant;Hazard Management;Health;Health protection;Homeostasis;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Individual;Inorganic Sulfates;International Agency for Research on Cancer;Iowa;Kinetics;Knowledge;Laboratories;Liver;Location;Lung;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammals;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Metals;Methods;Micronutrients;Minerals;Mission;Mitochondria;Mothers;Organ;Organ Specificity;Organelles;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Paint;Pathway interactions;Physical Chemistry;Plants;Point Mutation;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Prevalence;Prevention strategy;Progress Reports;Quinones;Recruitment Activity;Reference Values;Research;Risk Assessment;Route;Rural;Sampling;Science;Scientist;Seminal;Source;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Structure-Activity Relationship;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Superfund;Techniques;Therapeutic;Tissues;Toxic effect;Translational Research;Translations;Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates;Urine;Vacuum;Vitamins;Xenobiotics;antioxidant enzyme;base;cohort;copper zinc superoxide dismutase;design;dietary approach;dietary supplements;diphenyl;gender difference;genome-wide;genotoxicity;in vivo;interest;macromolecule;meetings;oxidation;potential biomarker;prevent;programs;response;semiquinone;small molecule;sound;success;telomere;toxicant;transcriptome sequencing","Project 1: PCBs: Metabolism Genotoxicity and Gene Expression in Vivo","PROJECT NARRATIVE Project 1 of the Iowa Superfund Research Program will provide new knowledge on the toxic effects and mechanisms of toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a large family of environmental pollutants that cause many different types of adverse human health effects including cancer.

Because the Analytical Core provides the trained staff maintains theinstruments and facilities and provides methods to assure accuracy precision representativenesscomparability and reproducibility the isrp research projects are able to make high impact discoveries publishtheir results in peer-review journals and more quickly provide scientific guidance regarding PCBs in theenvironment and their effect on human health.The Analytical Core supports the research of the isrp by extracting and analyzing samples for all 209 PCBsand for individual compounds in complex matrices including air samples; harbor sediment; human bloodserum; urine; laboratory animal tissues; plant tissues; soils; sludge; laboratory solutions building materialspaint and furniture. Each year the Analytical Core will complete thousands of such measurements as well ashundreds of quality control measurements and method development measurements. The Analytical Coreprovides detailed quality control guidance and collaborates closely with isrp researchers to determineappropriate methods for quality assurance control. Analyses for PCB congeners in environmental matricesincludes routine use of surrogate standards injected in every sample to assess and correct for analyticalefficiency; internal standards for quantification; duplicate injections; laboratory blanks calibration standardsand frequent analysis of materials with certified concentrations of PCBs. The rigor of the QC/QA protocol isunusual for PCB analysis but provides the critical foundation for discoveries in the research projects.The Analytical Core has a sustained history of innovation starting with the development of tandem massspectrometry for congener-specific analysis of PCBs in environmental and laboratory samples. This methodenabled many important discoveries and innovative findings in the isrp including the ability to link specific toxicproperties by compound; accurate determination of the lower molecular weight compounds; and precisemeasurement of all PCBs. The congener-specific method used by the Analytical Core enabled the discovery ofnon-Aroclors in the environment. The study of these compounds which are currently produced through somechemical manufacturing processes has been a major area of focus since that time. Innovations plannedinclude the development of efficient methods for routine analysis of known and as-yet unknown decay productsof PCBs. Although PCBs are very persistent and resistant to decay many PCBs can be broken down bysunlight and by metabolism in plants animals and humans.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARYThe Superfund Research Program at the University of Iowa (isrp) investigates the consequences ofatmospheric sources and exposures to semi-volatile lower-chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Thebiomedical and environmental research projects of the isrp need a variety of study compounds ranging fromtechnical and synthetic PCB mixtures to pure PCB congeners and their metabolites for studies of thevolatilization transport and exposure of these PCB congeners. A major obstacle for these studies is the largenumber of 209 PCB congeners plus the large number of 837 possible hydroxylated (OH-PCBs) sulfated (PCBsulfates) glucuronidated (PCB glucuronides) and other PCB metabolites. Many of these PCB derivatives arenot available from commercial sources or have never been synthesized before. Moreover obtaining PCBmixtures or individual PCB congeners from commercial sources can be expensive especially if largequantities are needed for animal studies. Therefore the MAJOR OBJECTIVE of the Synthesis Core is toprovide a large variety of fully characterized and highly pure PCB derivatives to individual research projectsand research support cores within the isrp. If time and resources allow the Synthesis Core will also makestudy compound available to other researchers especially researchers from other Superfund ResearchPrograms. At the same time the Synthesis Core will continue to develop novel synthetic strategies for thesynthesis of PCB congeners and PCB metabolites as needed by isrp researchers. The Specific Aims of theSynthesis Core are to 1) maintain and prepare PCB mixtures and pure PCB congeners; 2) preparehydroxylated PCB derivatives; synthesize PCB sulfate metabolites; and 4) prepare miscellaneous compoundsincluding OH-PCB glucuronides and diazomethane. Synthesis Core researchers have extensive experiencewith the preparation purification and characterization of all compounds requested by isrp research projects.The timely availability of PCB mixtures individual OH-PCBs PCB sulfates and other PCB metabolites willgreatly enhance and if the respective PCB metabolites are unavailable enable the innovative studiesproposed by isrp research projects.","Acetylcysteine;Address;Adult;Air;Animals;Area;Body Burden;Catechols;Chicago;Child;Development;Diazomethane;Exposure to;Funding;Glucuronides;Glutathione;Goals;Hydroquinones;In Vitro;Individual;Inhalation Exposure;Inorganic Sulfates;Iowa;Laboratory Study;Mammals;Metabolic;Parents;Peer Review;Plants;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Positioning Attribute;Preparation;Program Research Project Grants;Publications;Quinones;Rattus;Reagent;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resources;Schools;Series;Site;Source;Superfund;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Universities;Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates;Volatilization;community based participatory research;experience;exposed human population;field study;in vivo;innovation;novel;programs;repository;response","Synthesis Core","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe Iowa Superfund Research Program (isrp) addresses sources exposures and toxicity issues related toairborne polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) through determination of sources and magnitudes of exposurestudies on mechanisms of toxic responses and community-based participatory research that addresses bodyburdens of parent and metabolic products of atmospheric PCBs in adults and school children.

"Clinical Research","PROJECT SUMMARYAs measured by the articulations of the Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and our partner school personnelthe Community Engagement Core (CEC) has made a significantly positive impact in East Chicago Indiana andColumbus Junction Iowa where our primary engagement activities take place. The satisfaction of ourcommunity partners is our ultimate success metric. We recognize that the ongoing success of the CEC andthe Iowa Superfund Research Program (isrp) will require continued partnership in these communities. TheCEC has contributed to the development paths of East Chicago and Columbus Junction and future plans forsuccess include opportunities for growth and for deepening of relations. The CEC has and will continue toengage our partner schools and will address community issues related to airborne PCB exposure andremediation. The engagements proposed by the CEC are innovative in that they sustain successful long-standing aims that focus on our partner schools while introducing new aims that respond to stakeholder inputin the context of isrp research outcomes. For example the CAB in Columbus Junction suggested the CEC leadan effort to investigate the remediation of airborne PCBs in homes where measured concentrations are abovemean values. In the context of knowledge disseminated by the CEC and in partnership with the RTC the CABhypothesized that wall paint old fluorescent lighting and foam-based furniture could be PCB emission sources.In response to this hypothesis the CEC agreed to propose a modest community-based research effort to testthe hypothesis. The research approach has been developed in consultation with the CAB faculty and staffrepresenting isrp Projects 4 and 6 and RTC staff. The CEC will also collaborate with social scientist Dr.Madeleine Scammell to develop robust interview tools and methods that will garner Institutional Review Boardapproval and lead to scholarly publications facilitated by the CEC in partnership with Columbus Junctioncommunity members. An additional new aim is proposed that required the CEC to build relationships betweenisrp faculty and staff; the RTC; a small business focused on environmental remediation; and facilities staff andcouncil members from the town of Altavista Virginia. Altavista has been dealing with a PCB-contaminated sitefor years and the CEC secured permissions to study the fate of PCBs in poplar trees (Project 5) at the site.This aim will be pursued with heavy involvement from the RTC project researchers and Larry Robertson theisrp administrator who has been to the Altavista site to discuss remediation strategies with town officials.","Active Learning;Address;Administrator;Attitude;Authorship;Businesses;Chicago;Cities;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Consultations;County;Data;Development;Education;Engineering;Ensure;Environment;Equipment;Faculty;Furniture;Future;Growth;Hazardous Chemicals;Health;Health Sciences;Home environment;Household;Human;Human Resources;Indiana;Institutional Review Boards;Interview;Iowa;Joints;Knowledge;Lead;Lighting;Location;Measures;Methods;Mission;Online Systems;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Paint;Pamphlets;Perception;Play;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Program Research Project Grants;Progress Reports;Protocols documentation;Publications;Relationship-Building;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Schools;Science;Scientist;Secure;Shipping;Ships;Site;Solid;Source;Students;Superfund;Surveys;Testing;Toxic effect;Translational Research;Transportation;Trees;Universities;Virginia;Waste Management;air monitoring;air sampling;base;chemical spill;community based participatory research;design;equipment training;experience;field trip;forest;hatching;innovation;junior high school;landfill;meetings;member;programs;remediation;research study;response;satisfaction;seventh grade;social;success;teacher;tool","Community Engagement Core","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe Mission of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) is to address community and stakeholder needsrelated to the sources remediations and human impacts of airborne PCBs and related hazardous chemicalsthrough bidirectional partnerships.

"No NIH Category available","PROJECT SUMMARYThe Administrative Core is responsible for the coordination planning assessment project accounting andadministrative support of the research faculty and staff of the University of Iowa Superfund Research Program(isrp). Research efforts are supported and coordinated through regular monthly meetings of faculty studentsand research staff where new findings are discussed and ideas and concepts tested. A more formal weeklyseminar series is offered each semester in which a quarter of the speakers are from outside of the Universityoften from other Superfund Centers. This brings fresh perspectives and supports collaborative interactions. Anevaluative assessment of research progress and direction culminates in an annual meeting of all IowaSuperfund personnel with members of the External Advisory Committee where each project is reviewed andrecommendations made. Presentations are both oral by the project and core leaders and by detailed posterspresented by students and postdocs. The director of the isrp formally assesses the progress of the overallprogram on an annual basis with advice from the associate program director and the External AdvisoryCommittee. An Executive Committee composed of the project and core leaders is available for resolvingconflicts. Planning is accomplished through a process that allows each investigator to propose new orcontinuing work that is reviewed by the researchers as a group and the External Advisory Committee. The day-to-day coordination and oversight activities of the isrp including seminars and workshops are in the hands ofthe center administrator and program manager who is yet to be named for the coming funding cycle.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Superfund Research Program at The University of Iowa (ISRP) is a joint endeavor involving basic mechanistic and applied research projects in biomedical and environmental research areas addressing semi- volatile polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The overall goal of the ISRP is to identify atmospheric sources exposures and potential consequences to human health of semi-volatile PCBs. To achieve this goal the ISRP addresses volatilization transport and resultant exposure of lower halogenated PCBs especially those PCBs that are associated with contaminated waters former industrial sites and buildings (especially school buildings). We plan to identify routes of exposure with an eye to preventing or limiting exposure and ameliorating the effects. The ISRP brings together 17 scientists representing 7 departments in 5 colleges and two universities. Working together we will measure sources transport and environmental exposure of PCBs (Projects 4 and 6); their distribution metabolism and toxicity in animals and humans (Projects 1 3 and 7); and novel methods of phytoremediation (Project 5). Proposed studies include a community-based participatory research project-an of exposures to citizens who live or work in the vicinity of sources of lower chlorinated PCBs in the Chicago Metropolitan area. We enjoy the cooperation of citizen groups in Chicago IL and East Chicago IN where many ethnic-minority citizens are living below the poverty line near de- industrialized sites. Our research projects and overall efficiency are supported by six cores: Administration Synthesis Analytical Training Research Translation and Community Engagement - which assist the projects in coordination information transfer design and analysis of experiments and assessment of research. The Synthesis Core synthesizes all compounds/mixtures to be studied while the Analytical Core provides critical compositional information from metabolism to movement. Community Engagement and Research Translation Cores transmit research findings to a variety of stakeholders and involve those stakeholders in research activities. A Training Core and the research projects provide for the training of 16 students and postdoctoral scholars each year (70 have been trained in the previous funding period). The assessment / evaluation process culminates in an annual meeting of our 8-member External Advisory Committee. Overall this multidisciplinary program brings a broad range of experience and expertise and institutional resources to bear on problems associated with Superfund chemicals that are critical to the Midwest and the nation.      ","Address;Advisory Committees;Animals;Applied Research;Area;Biochemical;Biological;Body Burden;Boston;Chemicals;Chicago;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Data;Detection;Development;Educational workshop;Endocrine;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollutants;Europe;Evaluation;Exposure to;Eye;Faculty;Family;Federal Aids;Feedback;Fostering;Funding;Goals;Hazardous Substances;Health;Health Professional;Human;Inhalation Exposure;International;International Agency for Research on Cancer;Intervention;Iowa;Joints;Knowledge;Laboratories;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Metabolism;Methods;Midwestern United States;Molecular;Movement;Mus;Personal Satisfaction;Plants;Policies;Polychlorinated Biphenyls;Population;Positioning Attribute;Poverty;Process;Publications;Rattus;Reaction;Recommendation;Regulation;Research;Research Activity;Research Project Grants;Research Training;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Schools;Scientist;Site;Soil;Source;Students;Superfund;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Toxic effect;Training;Translating;Translational Research;Translations;Universities;Ursidae Family;Volatilization;Water;Wood material;Work;Writing;base;cellular targeting;college;community based participatory research;contaminated water;design;ethnic minority population;experience;exposure route;falls;improved;meetings;member;metropolitan;multidisciplinary;novel;novel strategies;prevent;programs;public health relevance;remediation;research study;superfund chemical;toxicant;uptake","Semi-Volatile PCBs: Sources Exposures Toxicities","Public Health Relevance: The University of Iowa Superfund Research Program (ISRP) will provide new knowledge on the toxic effects and mechanisms of toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) a large family of environmental pollutants that cause adverse human health effects including cancer.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diagnostic Radiology; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Physical Activity; Prevention; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent work suggests that exercise that moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical exercise is associated with slowing of symptom progression (motor cognitive and psychiatric) in prodromal Huntington's Disease (HD). In addition the literature shows that the intervention is well tolerated in prodromal HD. In subjects without HD moderate intensity physical exercise has been shown to improve white matter integrity increase caudate neuronal activity and increase striatum activation in spatial learning. Exercise has been shown to increase metabolic enzymes promote growth of blood vessels to provide increased nutrient and energy supply increase central BDNF expression and to promote local glucose metabolism in the basal ganglia. We hypothesize that initiating a moderate intensity physical exercise program will substantially slow progressive striatal volume loss and improve connectivity in prodromal HD. To test this hypothesis we will undertake a six- month randomized controlled study of home-based moderate intensity aerobic walking exercise program or balance and toning control. In the proposed study MR will be used to assess the impact of fitness and an exercise intervention on well established markers for HD progression in the brain including: volume of the caudate and putamen and white matter integrity using diffusion weighted imaging. In addition we will employ a quantitative relaxation parameter T1 relaxation in the rotating frame (T1) which we have shown to be sensitive to prodromal HD progression. To evaluate the influence of fitness and therapeutic effect of moderate intensity exercise in prodromal HD we propose two specific aims: 1) Does baseline fitness account for variance in motor function and brain imaging measures in prodromal HD? and 2) Does a moderate-to-vigorous exercise intervention influence the progression of motor impairment and brain degeneration in prodromal HD? This study will provide insight into the cascade of events that lead to anatomical changes in prodromal HD and will help reveal how exercise improves motor cognitive and psychiatric health in subjects with the Htt gene expansion.      ","Accounting;Adenine;Aerobic;Affect;Age;Age of Onset;Area;Atrophic;Basal Ganglia;Blood Vessels;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Brain imaging;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Cerebrum;Cognitive;Corpus striatum structure;Creatine;Cytosine;Data;Diagnosis;Diffusion;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease Progression;Dose;Eating;Energy Supply;Enzymes;Equilibrium;Event;Exercise;Exercise intervention;Genes;Glucose;Goals;Growth;Guanine;Health;Home environment;Huntington Disease;Huntington gene;Image;Individual;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Iowa;Lead;Learning;Length;Literature;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolic Marker;Metabolism;Moderate Exercise;Motor;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Nutrient;Onset of illness;Performance;Physical Exercise;Physical activity;Positioning Attribute;Production;Randomized Controlled Trials;Relaxation;Rest;Strenuous Exercise;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic Effect;Time;Triad Acrylic Resin;Universities;VO2max;Walking;Work;base;brain health;exercise intensity;exercise program;fitness;glucose metabolism;improved;in vivo;insight;lifestyle factors;mitochondrial dysfunction;motor impairment;motor symptom;public health relevance;putamen;randomized trial;symptom treatment;treatment response;vigorous intensity;white matter","Exercise Intervention for Slowing HD Progression","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We are proposing to perform a randomized controlled study of moderate aerobic walking and a balance and toning control in Huntington's disease.

"Arthritis; Clinical Research; Genetics","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disease that affects the bone skin and joints and can permanently deform the skeleton. Clinically CRMO is difficult to recognize and cannot be detected via biomarkers so diagnosis is often delayed. Although CRMO is rare affected patients often have a personal or family history of inflammatory conditions (e.g. psoriasis inflammatory bowel disease or inflammatory arthritis) so these diseases likely arise from dysregulation of the same immunologic pathway. We recently identified mutations in FBLIM1 (Filamin binding protein-1) in individuals with non-syndromic CRMO and psoriasis and discovered altered FBLIM1 expression in the Pstpip2 deficient mouse model of CRMO. Using protein immunoprecipitation mass spectroscopy (IP-MS) we identified novel binding partners of Pstpip2 the critical protein in the pathogenesis of CRMO in mice. We hypothesize that Pstpip2-interacting proteins are involved in bone homeostasis and that the genes that encode them are candidates for non-syndromic CRMO. Our goals for this proposal are to determine how mutations in FBLIM1 lead to CRMO and psoriasis; to determine the physiologic function of novel PSTPIP2 binding partners in inflammation of the bone and skin and to test if these proteins are associated with CRMO pathogenesis in our human cohort. The long term goal is to translate this newly acquired knowledge to the design of new therapeutic strategies so that it is translated into the care of individuals with CRMO and its associated disorders including psoriasis inflammatory bowel disease and inflammatory arthritis.        ","Actins;Address;Affect;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Autoimmune Diseases;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological Markers;Bone Resorption;Candidate Disease Gene;Caring;Cell Shape;Cell physiology;Cells;Child;Chronic;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Pathway;Etiology;Exposure to;Family history of;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Homeostasis;Human;Immune;Immune system;Immunologics;Immunoprecipitation;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Arthritis;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-10;Joints;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Mediating;Modeling;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Osteitis;Osteoclasts;Osteomyelitis;PTPN12 gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phagocytosis;Physiological;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase;Proteins;Proteomics;Psoriasis;Recurrence;Skeleton;Skin;Speed;Sterility;Susceptibility Gene;Syndrome;Techniques;Testing;Translating;anakinra;autoinflammatory;base;bone;cell motility;cohort;consanguineous family;cytokine;design;filamin;genetic approach;improved;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;link protein;macrophage;molecular targeted therapies;mouse model;mutant;mutant mouse model;neutrophil;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;public health relevance;response","Genetic and Immunologic etiology of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomylitis (CRMO)","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Chronic Recurrent Multifocal Osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an autoinflammatory disorder that affects the bone and is strongly associated with a personal and family history of inflammatory conditions (e.g. psoriasis inflammatory bowel disease or inflammatory arthritis) suggesting dysregulation of the same immunologic pathway.

"No NIH Category available","Project Summary/AbstractImmunology is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as The science that deals with the immune systemincluding cell-mediated and humoral aspects of immunity and immune responses. This includes bothunderstanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate and regulate immune responses as wellas applications of this understanding to the development of immune-based approaches to improved diagnosisprevention and therapy of disease. The goal of the University of Iowa Predoctoral Training Program inImmunology is to develop the capabilities of a diverse group of students to become successful scientists in aspectrum of independent careers contributing to progress in immunology encompassing both increasedunderstanding and more effective application of immune responses. This is a competitive renewal applicationfor years 20-25 of a training program supporting students pursuing doctoral studies in basic and translationalimmunology at The University of Iowa. 25 training faculty members and 7 resource faculty provide intensivelaboratory research training and effective relevant classroom instruction leading to the Ph.D. or the combinedM.D. Ph.D. degree in Immunology. The diversity of faculty research expertise within the discipline ofimmunology is a strength of the training opportunities provided and is complemented by a network of frequentand successful collaborations in funding publication and student training. Since its initial funding this Immunology Training Program award has supported 79 predoctoraltrainees of whom 94% completed their graduate degrees. All these former trainees remain in scientific careerstoday and those from the initial period are now in tenured faculty and leadership positions in industry andeducation. Although many of our trainees have roots in the Midwest our graduates go on to pursue successfulcareers throughout the US. Our trainees are productive in publishing their doctoral research results andtypically complete their doctorates within 5 years of entry to graduate work. In the most recent funding periodwe introduced new administrative leadership to the graduate program new coursework and initiatives in careerdevelopment and recruitment and new training faculty. Our proportion of minority trainees increased from 15%to 24% and of female training faculty from <10% to 20% (including a new female URM faculty member). Wecontinue to revise and optimize our Program to best meet the needs of trainee scientific careers and thediverse scientific workforce of the future. This award fills a critical need to support our continuing efforts intraining predoctoral students from diverse backgrounds for independent careers as immunologists and also toproviding geographic diversity in graduate training in immunology.","Immunology;Training Programs;pre-doctoral","Predoctoral Training Program in Immunology","Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health)The immune system provides humans with critically important protective responses to infectious pathogenssuch as viruses and bacteria as well as to tumor cells; but inappropriate immune responses can also causeinflammation and autoimmune diseases.

"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Genetics; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to determine the resilient and vulnerable components in the aging- or disease-induced functional decline of neuromuscular transmission using the powerful Drosophila genetic model system. An integrated approach at the molecular cellular and circuit levels can reveal the roles of key genes that exert critical influences on the aging process including Sod whose homologue in humans is implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gherig's disease). We found a striking robust life-span extension and improved motor ability through social interaction in Sod mutants upon co-housing with younger active flies. These plastic phenotypes readily quantified and manipulated provide a sensitized system to unravel the major interacting genetic networks underlying the aging process and to identify potential neuroprotection mechanisms against the functional decline in neuromuscular transmission. To facilitate the study of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in aging adults we recently developed a dissected preparation of adult abdominal NMJs that is accessible to paradigms and manipulations previously established for larval NMJs that have elucidated much of the genetic molecular and cellular bases. A multidisciplinary approach with the tools and protocols developed in our labs will facilitate correlation of data at different levels using transgenic flies for targeted expression or disruptin in pre- and post-synaptic neurons muscle and glia. Our Aims are: (1) Systematic studies on the aging-susceptible and aging-resilient physiological parameters to uncover the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of age-related functional decline in the new adult abdominal NMJ preparation. We will correlate electrophysiological and optical imaging measurements to reveal major modifications in presynaptic motor axon terminals synaptic contacts and postsynaptic muscle during aging. (2) Impacts of hyperexcitability mutations on age-related decline of NMJ function using mutants that have been well studied in larval NMJ and adult escape and flight circuits. Neuronal hyperexcitability has been implicated along with ROS stress in aging neurons. We will analyze pre- and post-synaptic elements using several hyperexcitability mutants of K+ channels implicated in ROS stress sensitivity or redox regulation including the redox-senstive Sh IA and slo BK channels. (3) Centering on Sod we will ask: i) how Sod and related mutations in redox regulation modify the progression of NMJ functional decline; and ii) how interacting genes of Sod act in a genetic network. We will investigate how modifications in NMJ properties reflect the striking plasticity of Sod phenotypes through social interaction. Integration of result from molecular investigations neuronal and circuit physiology and automated behavioral analysis will facilitate the discovery of key Sod interacting genes and may reveal promising targets for neuroprotective manipulations.","Abdomen;Action Potentials;Adult;Aging;Aging-Related Process;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Basic Science;Behavioral;Biological Models;Data Correlations;Degenerative Disorder;Development;Disease;Drosophila genus;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Employee Strikes;Figs - dietary;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Health;Homologous Gene;Housing;Human;Image;Investigation;Lead;Longevity;Maintenance;Measurement;Metabolic Pathway;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Motor;Motor Neurons;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Mutation;Nervous system structure;Neuroglia;Neuromuscular Junction;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Optics;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxides;Pattern;Phenotype;Physiological;Physiology;Potassium Channel;Preparation;Presynaptic Terminals;Process;Property;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Rana;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Site;Social Interaction;Stress;Synapses;Synaptic Transmission;System;Transgenic Organisms;age related;base;fly;functional decline;genetic analysis;genetic information;improved;infancy;interdisciplinary approach;large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels;mutant;neural circuit;neuromuscular transmission;neuronal circuitry;neuroprotection;neurotransmission;optic imaging;postsynaptic;postsynaptic neurons;presynaptic;response;tool","Genetic analysis of age-related functional decline of Drosophila NMJ","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the resilient and vulnerable components in the aging- or disease-induced functional decline of neuromuscular transmission which directly impacts daily activity and quality of life.

"Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Hematology; Nutrition; Obesity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in the United States (Center for Disease Control). Thrombosis represents one of the most common underlying pathologies in CVD. Diabetics are more susceptible to CVD which is the leading cause of death in these individuals; the mechanisms by which platelet dysfunction develops in diabetics are incompletely understood. Preliminary findings revealed enrichment in transcripts encoding the mitochondrial dynamics proteins mitofusin (MFN)-2 optic atrophy (OPA)-1 dynamin-related protein (DRP)-1 and mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1) in diet-induced obese mice; suggesting that platelet dysfunction in the diabetic milieu might be related to abnormal mitochondrial dynamics in platelets. Thus in an effort to define the relationship between mitochondrial dynamics and platelet dysfunction/thrombosis we performed platelet-specific deletion of proteins that regulate mitochondrial dynamics. This proposal will focus on the role of the mitochondrial fusion protein Optic Atrophy (OPA)-1. Thus the effects of OPA-1 deletion on the signaling pathways leading to platelet activation by various ligands will be evaluated. Our central hypothesis is that changes in mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial dysfunction will accelerate the development of thrombosis by increasing oxidative stress and subsequent platelet hyperactivity in part by promoting MPTP opening. We expect that the mitochondrial changes in OPA-1 deficient platelets will mirror the changes in the diabetic milieu of high fat fed insulin resistant mice. Mitochondrial dynamics is critical for mitochondrial healthand may be one underlying mechanism for increased thrombosis in diabetics. Validation of this mechanism would provide critical insight into the pathophysiology of thrombosis particularly in diabetics which represent an at risk population for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial and critical limb ischemia and cerebral strokes      ","Abnormal Platelet;Agonist;Antioxidants;Biological Markers;Blood Platelets;Blood Vessels;Blood coagulation;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cause of Death;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Chimeric Proteins;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Dynamin I;Exhibits;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Gene Targeting;Genes;Glycoproteins;Goals;Health;High Fat Diet;Hyperactive behavior;In Vitro;Individual;Insulin Resistance;Integrins;Ischemia;Knockout Mice;Laboratories;Ligands;Limb structure;Link;Membrane Potentials;Metabolic syndrome;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Proteins;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myocardial;NADPH Oxidase;Obese Mice;Obesity;Optic Atrophy;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Pathology;Phenotype;Platelet Activation;Platelet Count measurement;Population;Populations at Risk;Protein Dynamics;Proteins;Research;Risk;Role;Secondary Prevention;Signal Pathway;Testing;Thrombosis;Thromboxane A2 Receptor;Thrombus;Transcript;Validation;Venous;convulxin;diabetic;feeding;high risk;in vivo;insight;mitochondrial dysfunction;mitochondrial membrane;mitochondrial permeability transition pore;mortality;novel strategies;receptor;response;stroke;stroke therapy","Role of the mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy (OPA)-1 in platelet hyperactivity and thrombosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetics are susceptible to blood clots/thrombosis cause by abnormal platelet function.

"Aging; Cardiovascular; Kidney Disease; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CANDIDATE: Amy L. Sindler Ph.D. is a cardiovascular physiologist in Integrative Physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder. In this amended application Dr. Sindler's research aims to provide new insight into a novel pathway (impaired nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD+] bioavailability) by which aging and chronic kidney disease (CKD) independently and when occurring together produce vascular and renal dysfunction associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). She will also determine the efficacy of a novel NAD+ boosting compound as a potential therapeutic strategy. Her immediate goal is to acquire the research training and professional skills necessary to transition to an independent investigator. Her long-term goal is to develop a successful independent extramurally funded research program identifying novel pathways and the effectiveness of interventions to treat vascular and renal dysfunction to reduce CVD risk in CKD. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Sindler's research career development training consists of: 1) acquiring new experimental skills and approaches to strengthen her research plan; 2) further training in geriatrics and biostatistics; and 3) refinement of professional skillsdevelopment including formal course work attendance and presentations at weekly journal clubs university seminars national scientific meetings as well as Renal and Geriatric Grand Round Series and through regular interactions with her mentoring team. ENVIRONMENT: The environment for Dr. Sindler's training plan will be outstanding. The principal mentor Dr. Seals and co-mentor Dr. Levi are internationally recognized and NIA funded scientists with strong records of successful mentoring in biomedical research pertaining to vascular dysfunction aging CKD and CVD risk. Consulting-mentor Dr. Schwartz is PI on a long-standing NIA T32 thus perfect for developing general career skills in aging-geriatrics Dr. Imai is the leading expet in NAD+ biology and aging and Dr. McQueen is director of biostatistics in several research centers on campus. Dr. Sindler's mentorship team will provide specific expertise in key areas of her research project and overall training plan. RESEARCH: CVD are the leading cause of death in older patients with CKD. CVD risk is attributable in large part to vascular dysfunction primarily stiffening of the large elastic arteries and endothelial dysfunction. However the mechanisms by which aging and CKD interact to produce vascular and renal dysfunction and increase CVD risk is unknown. The proposed research seeks to provide insight into a novel pathway impaired NAD+ bioavailability by which aging and CKD interact to increase CVD risk as well as the efficacy of an NAD+ boosting therapy. Aim 1 will assess vascular and renal function with aging and CKD in 2 different mouse strains with differing susceptibility to renal damage/dysfunction. Aim 2 will determine the role of impaired NAD+ on vascular and renal dysfunction with aging and CKD as well as the efficacy of an NAD+ boosting therapy to treat vascular and renal dysfunction. Results from this study will provide the evidence needed to translate these findings to older patients with CKD.","Age;Age-Years;Aging;Albuminuria;Anabolism;Area;Arteries;Biological Availability;Biology of Aging;Biomedical Research;Biometry;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cause of Death;Chronic Kidney Failure;Clinical;Clinical Practice Guideline;Colorado;Consult;Deacetylase;Development;Doctor of Philosophy;Effectiveness of Interventions;Elderly;Endothelium;Environment;Enzymes;Extracellular Matrix;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Geriatrics;Glomerular Filtration Rate;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Inflammation;Journals;Kidney;Lead;Measures;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mentors;Mentorship;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mouse Strains;Mus;Nicotinamide Mononucleotide;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;Nitric Oxide;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Patients;Physiologic pulse;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Predisposition;Production;Professional Competence;Records;Renal function;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Training;Risk Factors;Role;Scientist;Series;Signal Transduction;Skills Development;Superoxides;Supplementation;Therapeutic;Training;Translating;Universities;Vascular Diseases;Vascular calcification;Work;age related;aging population;burden of illness;calcification;cardiovascular disorder risk;career development;clinical practice;drinking water;effective intervention;endothelial dysfunction;glomerulosclerosis;improved;insight;kidney vascular structure;male;meetings;middle age;mortality;nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;novel;novel therapeutics;older patient;overexpression;prevent;programs;seal;skill acquisition;skills;therapeutic target;vascular inflammation","Role of NAD+ Bioavailability in Vascular and Renal Dysfunction in Aging and CKD","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will provide new insight into novel pathway (impaired nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD+] bioavailability) by which aging and chronic kidney disease (CKD) separately and when occurring together produce vascular and renal dysfunction associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as the efficacy of a novel NAD+ boosting therapeutic strategy.

In part this is because progression is often slow sensitivebiomarkers to detect disease progression are not yet available and emerging outcomeinstruments have not yet been tested in trials. To address these issues we propose threePilot Projects two of which are novel and one of which is a continuation of a previousproject. Pilot Project 1 will contain two projects. First in collaboration with the MRCNeuromuscular Centre in London we will evaluate an MRC funded and developed MRItechnique as a potential multicenter biomarker to detect progression in CMT1. Secondlywe will evaluate novel quantitative sensory measures as potential biomarkers forCMT1A. These studies will enable us to determine whether MRI and tactile measurescan be used as an outcome measure for patients with CMT1A the most common formof CMT. Results will also serve as a comparison for studies in other forms of CMT. PilotProject 2 will investigate the potential utility of skin biopsy for CMT. We will perform RT-PCR studies in skin biopsies of CMT1A to correlate changes between the animal modelsand patients with CMT1A to determine whether biopsies can be used as biomarkers intrials and natural history studies. We will evaluate morphological abnormalities inmyelinated dermal nerves from skin biopsies from CMT1A CMT1B CMT1X and CMT2Ato determine whether there are morphological markers of severity and progression in thefour most common genetic subtypes of CMT. Finally we will generate grow and freezedown fibroblasts from skin biopsies from CMT patients for assays and for developmentinto immortalized pluripotential stem cells (iPSC). These fibroblasts will be madeavailable to investigators within and outside of the INC RDCRC. Pilot Project 3 isa continuation of Pilot Project 3 from our original funding cycle. It will investigatesafety and provide preliminary data to determine the potential effects of a curcuminderivative to slow disease progression in patients with CMT1B. The project will alsoallow us to evaluate our two recent outcome instruments CMTPedS and CMTNSv2in trials with children and adults.","Address;Adult;Animal Model;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Child;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Curcumin;Data;Dermal;Detection;Disease Progression;Esthesia;Evaluation;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fibroblasts;Freezing;Funding;Genetic;Hand;Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Type I;Hereditary Motor and Sensory-Neuropathy Type II;Image;Impairment;Individual;Lead;London;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Meissners Corpuscle;Muscle;Natural History;Nerve;Neuromuscular Diseases;Neuropathy;Nylons;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Pathogenesis;Patients;Phase;Phase II Clinical Trials;Pilot Projects;Progressive Disease;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Quality of life;Research;Research Personnel;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Safety;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Sensory;Severities;Site;Skin;Stem cells;Tactile;Techniques;Teleconferences;Testing;Touch sensation;Type 4 Charcot Marie Tooth Disease;Upper Extremity;Voting;Work;assay development;base;cohort;density;hereditary neuropathy;innovation;instrument;neuromuscular;novel;potential biomarker;pressure;professor","Pilot Projects: Evaluation of MRI & Quantitative Tactile Function as Biomarkers for CMT; Skin biopsy analysis in CMT; Curcumin derivatives to treat CMT1B","n/a","NINDS","9144457","9/2/2016","PAR-15-019","5U54NS065712-09","5","U54","NS","065712","09","",""," "," ","ZNS1-SRB-S","5140","1868507","SHY, MICHAEL E.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2016","8/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","99096"," ","76711","22385"," "," ",
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Clinical Research; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Peripheral Neuropathy; Physical Activity; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT: STANDARD OF CARECMT1 CMT2 and CMT4 are caused by mutations in > 80 genes. Despite the geneticheterogeneity there are clinical similarities in most patients even if the speed ofprogression may vary. Distal wasting weakness and sensory loss that begin in the lowerlimbs and progress proximally in a length-dependent manner characterize most forms ofCMT. Despite progress in identifying its causes there are still no publishedcomprehensive standards of care (SOC) for CMT. We have a unique opportunity todevelop them. During the initial cycle of our RDCRC we have enrolled over 6500patients into the protocols of the INC.

"Biotechnology; Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Peripheral Neuropathy; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT: IDENTIFYING GENETIC FACTORS THAT CAUSE AND MODIFY CMTMore than 80 different genes have been identified to cause the various forms of CMT. For the demyelinatingforms of CMT a genetic cause can be found most of the time with CMT1A (PMP22 duplication) explaining~70% of these cases. In contrast a mutation in one of the currently known genes can be found in less than40% of axonal (CMT2) cases mostly for the severe early onset cases. Genetic studies have fundamentallytransformed our knowledge on CMT and have catalyzed much of the research in neuropathies in the past 20years. We fully expect that by taking advantage of new technologies this progress will continue to a pointwhere (1) >90% of CMT1 and CMT2 patients can receive a genetic diagnosis; (2) a sizable number ofimportant genetic modifiers that account for a significant portion of the phenotypic variability in some forms ofCMT will be identified; (3) a proportion of the heretofore idiopathic/sporadic neuropathies will be found to havea genetic cause; (4) genetic risk factors for developing neuropathy to diabetes and various medications will beidentified. The members of the INC consortium work in a collaborative manner with multiple sources of funding toachieve these goals. In particular the INC has allowed us to collect high-quality samples for novel geneidentification (15 new CMT genes) and also for reliable gene modifier studies as demonstrated by our resultsin a CMT1A study. In this renewal we propose to expand our efforts to find new genes that cause CMT andgenetic modifiers of CMT. Novel genes will expand our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms anddemyelination. They will also provide new therapeutic targets. Modifiers will also be important targets forintervention and may well be important in the manifestations of acquired peripheral neuropathies and evenother diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis in which axonaldegeneration has been implicated in the pathogenesis. Finally as our collaborative group and others moverapidly towards genomic approaches we will establish a unified secure and accessible resource for allgenomic data of the INC that will be open to all CMT and other genetic researchers that can also serve as ablueprint for other RDCRN groups interested in inherited diseases.","Accounting;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Area;Candidate Disease Gene;Clinical Trials;Code;Communities;Counseling;Data;Databases;Demyelinations;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnostic;Disease;Family;Funding Agency;Gene-Modified;Genes;Genetic;Genetic study;Genome;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy Type I;Hereditary Motor and Sensory-Neuropathy Type II;Individual;Inherited;Interest Group;Intervention;Knowledge;Link;Multiple Sclerosis;Mutation;Neuropathy;Other Genetics;Outcome;PMP22 gene;Pathogenesis;Patients;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physicians;Price;Rare Diseases;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Sample Size;Sampling;Secure;Sequence Analysis;System;Systems Analysis;Time;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Vertebral column;Work;abstracting;axonal degeneration;base;early onset;exome;feeding;genetic disorder diagnosis;genetic risk factor;genome analysis;genome sequencing;genome wide association study;genome-wide;genomic data;hereditary neuropathy;member;new technology;new therapeutic target;novel;phenotypic data;tool;whole genome","Identifying Genetic Factors That Cause and Modify CMT","n/a","NINDS","9144455","9/2/2016","PAR-15-019","5U54NS065712-09","5","U54","NS","065712","09","",""," "," ","ZNS1-SRB-S","5138","8147824","ZUCHNER, STEPHAN ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2016","8/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","396293"," ","373908","22385"," "," ",
"Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease; Clinical Research; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Peripheral Neuropathy; Rare Diseases","ABSTRACT: NATURAL HISTORY STUDIES ON THE INHERITED NEUROPATHIESCharcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is the eponym for heritable peripheral neuropathy. CMTaffects approximately 1 in 2500 people and is divisible into three large sub-groups; CMT1(dominantly inherited demyelinating neuropathies) CMT2 (dominantly inherited axonalneuropathies) and CMT4 (recessively inherited neuropathies). Mutations in more than 80genes cause CMT1 CMT2 and CMT4. The biological basis for demyelination and axonaldegeneration in these disorders has enabled rational therapy development for certainsubtypes of CMT. Clinical trials however have been limited by a combination of a lack ofnatural history data a lack of outcome measures that are sensitive to change in a shortperiod of time and a lack of outcome measures for young children with CMT. We haveenrolled over 6500 participants into the protocols of the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium(INC) during our first cycle in the RDCRN. Support from our patient advocacy groups (PAGs)has allowed us to expand from 6 to 17 sites within the INC. Additional support from NINDSallowed us to develop the CMT-International Database (CMT-ID) a group of national CMTregistries who also use the CMT Minimal Dataset and house their data at the DMCC.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Kidney Disease; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects more than 10 million people worldwide each year with reported mortalities from 15 to 60% in different patient populations. However methods are lacking to support the early diagnosis of AKI that could lead to early intervention improved therapy better prognosis and lower medical costs. For these reasons the development of early diagnosis tools for AKI is one of the solicited research topics listed by the NIDDK. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a reliable biomarker for AKI and may also have some predictive uses.  We propose to develop a portable device for reliable early detection of AKI at point-of-care. The innovation of our proposal lies in the combination of aptamer technology with microcantilever detection of NGAL an early marker of AKI [2-4h at the onset of AKI; cutoff ~150 ng/ml]. Aptamers are single stranded DNAs or RNAs that bind their targets avidly and specifically and are selected in vitro by Systematic Evolution f Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX). For biosensor development aptamers have many advantages over antibodies including their smaller size amenability to chemical synthesis and modifications and adaptability to a broad range of assay formats including a microcantilever detection system. A microcantilever is a beam often of silicon that is 1-5 m thick and 500-100 m long and anchored only at one end. The microcantilever bends when its surface stress changes due to the conformation change that occurs upon ligand-receptor (e.g. aptamer-target) interaction on its surface. The differential surface stress between a reference cantilever coated with a scrambled nucleic acid that does not bind the analyte and a sensing cantilever coated with an aptamer that binds the analyte is measured by interferometry.  In a phase I study we isolated several aptamers that bind NGAL and demonstrated the abilities of one of these to sense NGAL when the aptamer is attached to a microcantilever. In this phase II study we propose the following specific aims: 1) Compare several aptamers for specificity functionality in the presence of serum proteins affinity for NGAL effectiveness in the presence of salt mixtures characteristic of plasma and urine and compatibility with the microcantilever device 2) Optimize the best performing aptamers for length sequence stability and optimal assay performance in blood and urine and 3) Optimize the microcantilever device for aptamer sensing (dynamic range of 1-100 nM for detection signal/noise ratio > 10 covariance < 10%). Miniaturize the microcantilever device to a size equal to or smaller than a shoebox.  From these studies we expect to develop an optimized and reliable aptamer-functionalized microcantilever by which NGAL can be quantified in plasma and urine samples with robust signal/noise ratio sensitivity detection limit and dynamic range of measurement. Phase III studies will involve manufacturing and validating the device for monitoring NGAL to detect AKI at point-of-care.","Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis;Affect;Affinity;Antibodies;Aptamer Technology;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biosensor;Blood;Blood Proteins;Characteristics;Chemicals;Classification;Clinics and Hospitals;Cost Analysis;Creatinine;Detection;Development;Device or Instrument Development;Devices;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Digestive System Disorders;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Early treatment;Effectiveness;Evolution;Funding;Future;Goals;Health;Hour;In Vitro;Institutes;Intensive Care Units;Interferometry;Intervention;Kidney Diseases;LCN2 gene;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Length;Life;Ligands;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Methods;Modification;Molecular Conformation;Monitor;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Noise;Nucleic Acids;Onset of illness;Output;Patient Monitoring;Patients;Performance;Phase;Plasma;Population;Procedures;Process;Proteins;Quantitative Evaluations;RNA;RNA Binding;Renal function;Reporting;Research;Risk;Role;Sales;Sampling;Serum;Serum Proteins;Signal Transduction;Silicon;Single-Stranded DNA;Sodium Chloride;Specificity;Stress;Surface;System;Technology;Temperature;Thick;Time;Urea;Urine;Vision;aptamer;base;cantilever;chemical synthesis;cost;improved;innovation;instrument;miniaturize;monitoring device;mortality;nanomolar;outcome forecast;patient population;phase 1 study;phase 2 study;phase 3 study;point of care;receptor;research and development;response;sensor;tool","Early diagnosis of acute kidney injury by aptasensors","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects more than 10 million people worldwide per year with 15-60% mortality.

"Aging; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Hematology","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thrombotic complications such as cardiovascular diseases and stroke are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in our aging population. Despite the strong clinical association between aging and thrombosis the mechanisms of thrombosis in the elderly are not well understood. In a recent study we demonstrated that aged mice display increased susceptibility to thrombosis. Our findings also revealed that aged mice develop increased intra-platelet hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and platelet hyperactivity (increased integrin aIIb3 activation). Importantly genetic approaches to eliminate H2O2 prevented platelet hyperactivity in aged mice suggesting that H2O2 is a critical mediator. Importantly our pilot studies in human subjects demonstrate that platelets from aged humans exhibit peroxide mediated hyperactivity The objectives of this application are to identify the upstream mechanism leading to accumulation of H2O2 in platelets and to determine whether prevention of H2O2-mediated platelet hyperactivity decreases aging-associated increased thrombotic susceptibility. Our central hypothesis is that aging results in increased arterial and venous thrombotic susceptibility via enhanced platelet activation in a pathway that includes generation of superoxide by a Nox2- containing NADPH oxidase followed by conversion of superoxide to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) leading to H2O2-induced enhancement of platelet activation. The rationale for this hypothesis is that Nox2- containing NADPH oxidase is the major source of platelet reactive oxygen species and our recent study demonstrated upregulation of NADPH oxidase and SOD1 in platelets from aged mice. Aim 1 will determine the mechanistic roles of NADPH oxidase and SOD1 in platelet hyperactivation in aging. Aim 2 will determine whether inhibition of H2O2-mediated platelet hyperactivity is sufficient to decrease thrombotic susceptibility with aging. Studies will utilize a novel mouse model in which endogenous platelets are immunodepleted prior to transfer of platelets from aged or young mice allowing assessment of the effects of donor platelets on arterial occlusion and venous thrombosis in the absence of potential confounding effects of host platelets. Aim 3 will evaluate hyperactivity of platelets from aged humans and its thrombotic consequences. Understanding the mechanism by which platelet activation with aging contributes to thrombotic susceptibility has the potential to reveal new therapeutic strategies to minimize vascular decline in the elderly.","Adoptive Transfer;Aging;Antibodies;Biological Assay;Blood Platelets;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Clinical;Coagulation Process;Collaborations;Comorbidity;Data;Deep Vein Thrombosis;Elderly;Enzymes;Epidemiologic Studies;Epitopes;Event;Exhibits;Generations;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Hyperactive behavior;Incidence;Integrins;Life Expectancy;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;NADPH Oxidase;Oxidases;Pathway interactions;Peptides;Peroxides;Pilot Projects;Platelet Activation;Population;Predisposition;Prevention;Pulmonary Embolism;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research Personnel;Role;Source;Stress;Superoxides;Surface;Testing;Thrombosis;Thrombus;Transgenic Organisms;Up-Regulation;Venous;Venous Thrombosis;Wild Type Mouse;Work;age effect;age related;aged;aging population;artery occlusion;base;genetic approach;glutathione peroxidase;human subject;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;mortality;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;older patient;overexpression;prevent;research study;stroke","Peroxide mediated prothrombotic effects of aging","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart attack and stroke due to clot formation in blood vessels are common causes of morbidity and mortality in aging.

"No NIH Category available","As of July 1 2015 the Department contracts with 19 local health departments toperform retail food licensing inspections and enforcement in 3 cities and 58 of Iowa's99 counties. The Department directly performs the retail inspections licensing andenforcement in 50 of 99 counties including state's most populous county Polk Countywhich includes Des Moines. The state directly inspects over 50% of foodestablishments or approximately 11000 and the 19 local governments inspect 11000.The Department currently employs 17 individuals that routinely complete retail foodinspections. The local health agencies employ over 50 additional inspectors whocomplete retail food inspections. Overall the completion of the projects described in this proposal and relateddocuments will allow the Department to move toward full conformance and enhanceconformance with the retail program standards. The development of the reports/exportsrelated to compliance and enforcement and routine regular review of progress of eachinspector will assist in ensuring continued conformance with Standard 6 and furtherensure appropriate attention is being focused by inspectional and leadership staff toensure the reduction of risk factor violations. The development and use of the chain orowner baseline survey (trending) will assist in educating and showing operators wheresystematic improvements can be made to assist in reduce risk factor violations. Weanticipate this owner or chain approach could have a significant impact in reducing riskfactor violations and improving practice in multiple establishments. Using the baseline survey to help guide the development and revision ofdocuments will assist in reducing risk factor violations. Routinely reviewing andupdating documents will ensure the most current and effective information is provided.Translating the documents into appropriate languages and enhancing the documentsusing most illustrations and graphics will also assist in communicating concepts relatedto risk factor violations to operators. Further using social media and other techniqueswill enhance and provide a more effective means of communicating and ofteninstantaneous. Lastly the joint inspection program will improve inspectional quality and allowmentoring and shadowing desired behaviors to improve the overall quality ofinspections.

"No NIH Category available","AbstractThe Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health (Health Department) operates a retailfood regulatory program focused on the reduction of risk factors known to cause or contribute tofoodborne illness. The Health Department centers on active managerial control and is workingon the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards (Standards). To date theHealth Department has conformed to four of the nine Standards. This funding opportunityprovides a platform to achieve greater conformance with the Standards and to implementinnovative intervention strategies to reduce occurrence of contributing risk factors. The project'sgoal is to develop implement and continuously improve the infrastructure and effectiveness ofthe Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health's retail food safety program using theStandards to ensure food safety. Two aims were developed to achieve the goal.Aim 1 is by August 2017 the Cerro Gordo County Department of Public Health will increasetheir Standard achievement to 100% compliant. Health Department staff developed an actionplan for success in compliance with Standards 1 5 6 8 and 9. Highlighted activities includehiring a food inspector to reduce the inspections to staff ratio gaining equipment to improveinspection quality implementing quality assurance activities (i.e. sampling files for compliancereview) updating the inspections database and conducting a facility study. As each Standard isapproved by the verifying agency it along with already achieved Standards will cycle topromote continuous program improvement. Aim 2 is that by August 2020 Health Departmentstaff through Standards quality improvement will achieve a 15% decrease in risk-factorviolations. Three branches of innovation will aid in reduction. First is implementation of theOlmstead County Minnesota Procedures Training Verification electronic assessment system.It provides a platform for communication and education with retail food operators andprioritizes a system for follow-up and consultation. The system is active managerial control thatdetermines whether a facility is in control of their risk factors. The second category isembedding food safety courses in the community thereby flooding the area with certified foodhandlers. Staff will work with community organizations retail food facilities and individuals toincrease course offerings. Third is a category that will transform the existing Food SafetyManual to oral culture to better educate food workers. This project will help the HealthDepartment meet their mission to optimize the health of all people in Cerro Gordo County."," ","Active Managerial Control - the Backbone of Local Food Safety Initiatives","Project NarrativeFood safety is a public health issue that affects millions of Americans daily.

We will obtain age 23 bone outcomes (DXA pQCT and MDCT); collect detailed dietary alcohol tobacco sleep physical activity and body composition data; and model the variability in individual development of whole bone and trabecular and cortical bone micro-architecture. Specifically we propose to: 1) Determine the impact of changes in physical attributes (weight adipose tissue lean body mass) and lifestyle behaviors (physical activity dietary intakes tobacco use and sleep) during the adolescent-adult transition (measured at 19 21 and 23 years of age) on changes in measures of bone mass density geometry and micro-architecture derived from DXA pQCT and MDCT (measured at 19 and 23 years of age) and 2) Assess the relationships between levels and patterns of physical attributes physical activity dietary intakes and other factors from 5 to 23 years of age and during the pre-pubertal peri-pubertal and post-pubertal developmental periods on measures of bone mass density geometry and micro-architecture assessed both at age 23 when bone development is largely complete as well as longitudinally from age 5 to 23.  Late adolescence/early adulthood is a period of major lifestyle behavior changes but major gaps remain in our understanding of the effects of modifiable and non-modifiable factors on bone development during the adolescent-adult transition period. This period is important in determining future risk for osteoporosis and bone fractures. Few studies have assessed bone outcomes and their determinants longitudinally from middle childhood to early adulthood. The Iowa Bone Development Study (IBDS) in its 17th year is investigating the effects of physical attributes lifestyle behaviors dietary intakes and other factors on bone development and micro-architecture. We assessed bone measures at ages 5 8 11 13 15 and 17 years using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) collected dietary data from birth and assessed physical activity by accelerometry and questionnaire from age 5. Analogous cross-sectional measures for cohort parents are also available. Age 19 exams are in progress (n=255 to date) with the addition of high-resolution multi-detector CT scans (MDCT) of the distal tibia and advanced algorithms to assess bone micro-architecture advanced 3-D accelerometry and more detailed lifestyle questionnaires.  Continued follow-up of the IBDS cohort to early adulthood with emphasis on micro-architecture will provide major insights into the relative importance of the many explanatory factors on bone development and strength and the developmental period(s) of greatest impact providing a strong foundation for future design of strategies and interventions tooptimize skeletal health.","19 year old;2 year old;3-Dimensional;5 year old;Accelerometer;Address;Adipose tissue;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Adverse effects;Affect;Age;Age-Years;Algorithms;Architecture;Behavior;Belief;Birth;Body Composition;Bone Development;Bone Diseases;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Data;Data Collection;Dental caries;Development;Diet;Dietary Alcohol;Dietary intake;Disease;Distal;Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry;Elderly;Fluorides;Foundations;Fracture;Future;Generations;Geometry;Growth;Guidelines;Health;Health Personnel;Individual;Intake;Intervention;Investigation;Iowa;Knowledge;Life;Life Style;Maintenance;Measurement;Measures;Milk;Modality;Modeling;Osteoporosis;Other Genetics;Outcome;Parents;Pattern;Peripheral;Physical activity;Prevention;Property;Public Health;Publishing;Questionnaires;Recommendation;Research;Resolution;Resources;Risk;Series;Sleep;Structure;Technology;Time;Tobacco;Tobacco use;Weight;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;abstracting;behavior change;bone;bone geometry;bone health;bone mass;bone quality;bone strength;cohort;density;design;detector;emerging adult;follow-up;improved;innovation;insight;lean body mass;middle childhood;neglect;prevent;programs;research and development;response;skeletal;substantia spongiosa;tibia;young adult","Fluoride Dietary and Other Factors Related to Young Adult Bone Measures and Dental Caries","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although osteoporosis is generally considered a disease of older adults there is increased recognition of the importance of adequate bone development in childhood adolescence and early adulthood for the prevention of bone disease later in life.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Cervical Cancer; Radiation Oncology","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rotating shield brachytherapy (RSBT) is a novel form of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) delivered through shielded rotating catheters which provide unprecedented control over radiation dose distributions. RSBT is expected to provide superior sub-volume boosting and toxicity relative to any existing radiotherapy modality resulting in a paradigm shift in HDR-BT for many cancer sites. Although RSBT was conceptualized more than ten years ago its clinical implementation poses tremendous challenges demanding fundamentally advanced innovative technologies. With recent development of radiation sources an effective and efficient RSBT treatment planning system has become a limiting factor for clinical development of RSBT. To this end this project will develop fundamentally novel technology and algorithms to break the formidable computational barriers to bring RSBT into clinic.  We hypothesize that rotating shield brachytherapy powered with advanced treatment planning techniques and software will provide significant dosimetric improvements in tumor coverage and critical structure avoidance relative to conventional HDR-BT with a clinically acceptable delivery time. We propose to: 1) Develop an efficient compressed sensing based RSBT inverse dose optimization method enabling  sparse intensity modulation and optimized homogeneity of dose distributions with smooth fluence  maps in the resulting treatment plan. 2) Develop efficient shield sequencing methods to optimize the delivery of RSBT treatment plans striving to achieve the best tradeoff between plan quality and treatment time and to facilitate clinicians' decision making on selecting the best patient-specifi treatment plan. 3) Dosimetrically validate the RSBT treatment planning system retrospectively with clinical cases of cervical cancers and prostate cancers previously treated with HDR-BT. As a result our project will pave the road to make RSBT clinically available triggering a new era inbrachytherapy delivery.","Algorithms;Applications Grants;Attenuated;Automobile Driving;Biomedical Engineering;Brachytherapy;Breast;Cancer Patient;Catheters;Cervix Uteri;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Combinatorial Optimization;Complex;Complication;Computer software;Decision Making;Development;Discipline;Dose;Electronics;Endometrium;Epidural Anesthesia;Foundations;General Anesthesia;Goals;Health;High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy;Image;Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy;Interdisciplinary Study;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Maps;Medical Computer Science;Methods;Modality;Motion;Nature;Organ;Patients;Performance;Phase;Physics;Planning Techniques;Positron-Emission Tomography;Prostate;Radiation;Radiation Oncology;Radiation therapy;Rectum;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Risk;Source;Spinal Anesthesia;Structure;System;Techniques;Technology;Time;Toxic effect;Treatment Effectiveness;Vagina;arm;base;cancer site;dosimetry;empowered;human subject;improved;innovation;innovative technologies;meetings;new technology;next generation;novel;tool;treatment planning;tumor","Developing a Treatment Planning System for Next Generation Rotating-Shield Brachytherapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project is directed to establish a novel rotating-shield brachytherapy (RSBT) treatment planning system to advance high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-RT) to a new paradigm.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Patient Safety","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients who cannot communicate with doctors nurses other health professionals and caregivers are at increased risk for having adverse medical outcomes. Zubow and Hurtig (2013) reported that 14 percent of conscious hospitalized patients and 33 percent of intensive care unit patients were unable to independently activate standard nurse call systems. Based on those estimates and the annual U.S. hospital discharge rate one can extrapolate that at least 3.9 million American patients may have required some form of assistive technology in order to be able to summon help and communicate with their healthcare providers. It is essential that solutions be found that allow intubated and physically weak patients to summon help and effectively communicate. By addressing the causes of adverse medical outcomes U.S. hospitals have the potential to prevent 15000 deaths 450000 complications and $5 billion in avoidable costs. Innovation: The Iowa Adaptive Technologies Inc. (Voxello) team has developed a smart switch (noddleTM) that allows patients who have not been able to summon help or been able to use speech to communicate to access the nurse call system environmental controls and speech-generating devices. The development of the noddleTM used an iterative design approach that was informed by feedback from patients who were being kept alive with mechanical ventilation and whose physical conditions prevented them from accessing any existing nurse call pendants switches or other devices. To address the needs of patients the noddle's patent pending signal- processing algorithm detects a patient's slightest intentional gesture and uses the resulting signal to enable the patient to control multiple devices. Consequently patients who can only produce a tongue click an eye blink or any other small motor gesture can activate the nurse call and simultaneously control a speech-generating device. As a complement to the noddleTM Voxello has developed content for a communication app (noddle-chatTM to allow non-speaking patients to effectively communicate with their healthcare providers thereby reducing the risk of adverse medical outcomes and increasing patient satisfaction. Voxello is working to obtain FDA clearance for the noddleTM. Approach: Voxello will conduct clinical trials to determine how easily the noddleTM and noddle-chatTM can be implemented across clinical settings to enable patients to summon their nurses and effectively communicate. Commercialization: Voxello will manufacture the noddleTM at a US based certified medical device facility and will develop the necessary distribution channels to serve the hospital long-term care and home-care markets.       ","Address;Algorithms;American;Aspiration Pneumonia;Blinking;Breathing;Caregivers;Caring;Cessation of life;Client satisfaction;Clinical;Communication;Complement;Conduct Clinical Trials;Conscious;Decubitus ulcer;Development;Devices;Family Caregiver;Feedback;Gestures;Health Personnel;Health Professional;Hospitals;Intensive Care Units;Iowa;Legal patent;Long-Term Care;Marketing;Mechanical ventilation;Medical;Medical Device;Motor;Nurses;Oral;Outcome;Pain;Patient Care;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Provider;Reaction;Reporting;Risk;Rural;Self-Help Devices;Signal Transduction;Speech;System;Technology;Tongue;Work;Writing;base;clinical research site;commercialization;cost;fall risk;hospital discharge rate;improved;innovation;iterative design;nursing standards;patient home care;patient population;patient safety;physical conditioning;prevent;public health relevance;research clinical testing;signal processing","The Noddle: A smart switch to enhance patient-provider communication.","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A key factor that has been associated with adverse medical outcomes is poor patient-provider communication.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Lung; Lung Cancer; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is responsible for more cancer deaths than breast prostate and colon cancers combined. Minimal improvements in the five-year survival rate for lung cancer have occurred over the past thirty years. Recently a mortality benefit has been demonstrated for lung cancer screening using low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in people with high cancer risk. The clinical challenge for lung cancer screening is that the majority of lung nodules detected are not cancer. An approach that extracts quantitative measurements from the LDCT data at the time of screening and contributes to a reduction in the false positive rate without additional testing is urgently needed. The VIDA software system processes high resolution CT (HRCT) data to automatically identify and measure the major anatomical structures within the lungs (lobes airways vessels) while also providing a regional assessment of lung tissue integrity. These quantitative CT measurements can be used to identify and characterize the spatial distribution severity and longitudinal progression of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The risk of lung cancer is 2 to 3-fold higher in people with COPD thus quantitative CT metrics of COPD may contribute insight to lung cancer risk in the lung cancer screening population. It is the goal of this application to evaluate the performance of VIDA's existing HRCT analysis tools for application to optimized LDCT data and expand the analysis toolkit to include pulmonary nodule segmentation. Nodule segmentation in CT data is not a new technology; however nodule detection with simultaneous co-morbid lung disease assessment can provide a predictive and risk-based evaluation for lung cancer and represents a new form of precision medicine based on imaging analytics. Increased confidence in the risk of lung cancer for indeterminate LDCT detected lung nodules will result in rapid treatment for malignant cases while reducing emotional stress and invasive testing in those with benign lesions. The systematic evaluation of COPD over annual lung cancer screening time-points will also increase the value for subjects in which no lung nodules that are detected by quantitatively tracking disease progression. We propose developing a commercial lung nodule detection and risk stratification software (VIDA software analysis) utilizing the clinically collected LDCT data to non-invasively and cost-efficiently aid i the early stratification of patients to the appropriate clinical course of action.      ","Address;Advisory Committees;Age;Air;Algorithms;Assessment tool;Benign;Cancer Detection;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Patient;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Chest;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Clinical;Collaborations;Colon Carcinoma;Computer software;Data;Detection;Development;Disease Progression;Dose;Economic Inflation;Eligibility Determination;Emotional Stress;Environment;Evaluation;Exposure to;Goals;High Resolution Computed Tomography;High-Risk Cancer;Image;Image Analysis;Individual;Iowa;Lesion;Low Dose Radiation;Lung;Lung diseases;Lung nodule;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Manuals;Measurement;Measures;Medicare/Medicaid;Methods;Nodule;Noise;Output;Patients;Performance;Phase;Pleura;Population;Preventive service;Procedures;Process;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary Emphysema;Radiation;Reporting;Resolution;Respiratory physiology;Risk;Risk Assessment;Scanning;Screening for Lung Cancer;Severities;Slice;Smoking History;Solid;Spatial Distribution;Stratification;Structure;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Survival Rate;Testing;United States;Universities;Woman;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;cancer risk;cohort;cost;data acquisition;follow-up;high risk;insight;lung lobe;malignant breast neoplasm;men;mortality;new technology;novel;patient population;patient stratification;performance tests;precision medicine;programs;public health relevance;reconstruction;screening;small airways disease;software systems;tool;treatment planning;tv watching;user-friendly","Precision pulmonary disease evaluation and lung cancer detection using quantitative low-dose CT","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this project is to extend VIDA's automated lung disease evaluation software which has been developed using high resolution computed tomography (CT) data to address the needs of the lung cancer screening population.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Diseases/Herpes","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to elucidate the structures and fundamental mechanisms that give rise to drug transfer across the cell membrane by the AbgT-family of transporters. The primary targets of the proposed work are the Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH and Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF transporters. Approximately 13000 putative transporters of the family have been identified. However no structural information has yet been available and even functional data are minimal for this family of membrane proteins. It has been hypothesized that the AbgT-family transporters contribute to the bacterial folate synthesis pathway by importing the catabolite p-aminobenzoyl- glutamate for producing this essential vitamin. To understand the structure and function of the AbgT family of transporters we have recently cloned expressed purified and crystallized the full-length A. borkumensis YdaH and N. gonorrhoeae MtrF membrane proteins. We have also determined the X-ray structures of these two transporters at 2.9 and 3.9  resolutions respectively. The structures reveal that these two transporters assemble as dimers with architectures distinct from all other families of transporters. Both YdaH and MtrF are bowl- shaped dimers with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm halfway across the membrane bilayer. The monomers of YdaH and MtrF contain nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins. These structures directly suggest a plausible pathway for substrate transport. A combination of the crystal structure genetic analysis and substrate accumulation assay indicates that both YdaH and MtrF behave as exporters capable of removing the folate metabolite p-aminobenzoic acid from bacterial cells. Further experimental data based on drug susceptibility and radioactive transport assay suggest that both YdaH and MtrF participate as antibiotic efflux pumps importantly mediating bacterial resistance to sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs. Our hypothesis is that many of these AbgT-family transporters act as exporters thereby conferring bacterial resistance to sulfonamides. The specific aim is to define the structures and transport mechanisms of the AbgT family of transporters. We will use the structural biochemical and computational approaches to determine the molecular mechanisms of the YdaH and MtrF transporters. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human pathogen and the infectious agent for the sexually-transmitted disease gonorrhea. Although gonorrhea is one of the oldest described diseases it remains a significant global problem with more than 100 million cases reported annually worldwide with antibiotic resistance increasing at an alarming rate. Sulfonamides were used in the late 1930s and early 1940s to treat gonorrhea but the rapid emergence of strains resistant to this class of drug resulted in the removal of sulfonamides from lists of recommended therapies.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The vector-borne protozoan diseases collectively called leishmaniasis affect ~12 million people in 88 countries worldwide. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) the most common form of leishmaniasis causes a localized inflammatory skin lesion followed by ulceration and usually resolution. A vigorous inflammatory response occurs at the time of ulceration. Observations of human infection lead to the hypothesis that ulceration and an inflammatory response is necessary for CL healing. Bacterial co-infection and secondary infection are common CL complications but their effects on disease outcome have not been explored. Inflammasome complexes can form in innate immune cells in response to intracellular ""danger"" signals leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 Three NLR proteins including NLRP3 and NLRC4 activate inflammasome complexes that include the adaptor protein ASC. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are bacteria on human skin that activate NLRP3 and NLRC4 respectively. We hypothesize inflammasomes are activated by bacteria present at the ulceration phase of L. major infection allowing for control of the parasitic infection. To test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine how bacterial co-infection affects the phenotype and cellular elements of the inflammatory response in cutaneous leishmaniasis. We will co-infect mice with L. major plus S. aureus or P. aeruginosa and study the effects on the course of bacterial and parasite infection and the host immune response. Our study will test the hypothesis that bacterial co-infection results in an enhanced inflammatory response and local activation of the inflammasome which in turn contributes to resolution of L. major infection. 2) Examine the role of the inflammasome on the host response to L. major during bacterial infection. Co- infection studies will be repeated in mice deficient in inflammasome components (caspase-1-/- ASC-/- NLRP3-/-  NLRC4-/-) to test the effects of inflammasomes on antimicrobial immunity and bacterial or parasite clearance. 3) Test whether constitutively inducing inflammasome responses changes the outcome and/or host response of L. major infection. Mice will be infected with WT or transgenic L. major expressing flagellin a known activator of NLRC4. Thus we will examine whether constitutive activation of the inflammasome promotes parasite clearance and CL lesion resolution. Understanding the effects of bacterial co-infection and inflammasomes in CL will lay the groundwork for future studies of the interactions between the skin microbiome and innate immunity during parasitic infection. The knowledge gained may contribute to improved approaches to treatment of leishmaniasis. This project will further our understanding of an infectious and immunologic disease and enable us to develop better treatment and prevention strategies for this emerging disease supporting the mission of the NIAID.      ","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Affect;Anterior nares;Apoptosis;Bacteria;Bacterial Counts;Bacterial Infections;Binding;Bite;CASP1 gene;Caspase;Cells;Clinical;Communicable Diseases;Complex;Country;Cutaneous Leishmaniasis;Disease;Disease Outcome;Ear structure;Elements;Environment;Exposure to;Family member;Flagellin;Frequencies;Future;Gram-Negative Bacteria;Gram-Positive Bacteria;Healed;Human;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Infection;Infectious Skin Diseases;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-18;Knowledge;Lead;Leishmania;Leishmania major;Leishmaniasis;Lesion;Leucine-Rich Repeat;Mission;Morbidity - disease rate;Mouse Strains;Mus;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;Natural Immunity;Nucleotides;Outcome;Parasites;Parasitic Diseases;Parasitic infection;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Prevalence;Prevention strategy;Proteins;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;Reporting;Resolution;Role;Sand Flies;Signal Transduction;Skin;Soil;Spleen;Staphylococcus aureus;Superinfection;Systemic disease;Testing;Time;Transgenic Organisms;Ulcer;Water;Wild Type Mouse;antimicrobial;co-infection;commensal microbes;cytokine;healing;human disease;improved;in vivo;lymph nodes;macrophage;mortality;pathogen;public health relevance;receptor;response;secondary infection;skin lesion;skin microbiome;treatment response;treatment strategy;vector","The role of inflammasomes in bacterial co-infection during cutaneous leishmaniasis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic disease caused by a sand fly bite that presents as a localized inflammatory response and lesion ulceration followed by healing.

"Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major limitation in treating Parkinson's disease (PD) is the development of L-Dopa induced dyskinesias (LIDs). LIDs are disruptive involuntary movements that lead to a decreased quality of life in PD patients. To date the neural mechanism underlying this debilitating side effect is poorly understood. Thus this proposal combines neurophysiology optogenetics and automated motion tracking to explore the mechanism involved. Prior work demonstrates a reduction in LIDs following serotonergic neuron ablation in a rat model of PD. In the proposed study we will address the involvement of the serotonergic system by first determining if serotonergic neurons are necessary for the development of LIDs (Aim 1) and then determining if it is specifically serotonergic projections to D1 neurons in the striatum that modulate LIDs (Aim 2).  To identify the general role of serotonergic system in the development of LIDs we will inject hemiparkinsonian Lmx1bf/f/p mice lacking serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system with L-dopa and document abnormal involuntary movements. Next we propose to optogenetically target the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as the main nucleus involved in LIDs as it heavily projects to the striatum.  To study the interaction between the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems in the striatum during LIDs we first combine striatal neuronal ensemble recordings with pharmacological manipulations. Striatal activity (neuronal firing rate and local field potential) will be paired wih LIDs in awake-behaving animals. Secondly we measure LIDs while pharmacologically inhibiting serotonergic neurons and transiently stimulating D1 neurons with optogenetics techniques. Elucidating the mechanism of LIDs may lead to the development of therapies that will inhibit dyskinesias enhance motor benefits from L-dopa and potentially avoid the need for more invasive surgical treatment significantly increasing the quality of life in these patients.      ","Ablation;Address;Adverse effects;Affect;Animals;Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases;Attenuated;Cell Nucleus;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Development;Dopamine;Dopamine D1 Receptor;Dorsal;Dyskinetic syndrome;Exhibits;Goals;Involuntary Movements;Lead;Levodopa;Link;Maps;Measures;Midbrain structure;Modeling;Motion;Motor;Movement;Movement Disorders;Mus;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Operative Surgical Procedures;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Pharmacotherapy;Population;Quality of life;Rattus;Role;Serotonergic System;Substantia nigra structure;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Transgenic Animals;Transgenic Organisms;Treatment Efficacy;United States;Work;abnormal involuntary movement;awake;dopaminergic neuron;dorsal raphe nucleus;innovation;motor symptom;mouse model;neuromechanism;neurophysiology;novel therapeutics;optogenetics;public health relevance;raphe nuclei;receptor expression;research study;therapy development","Role of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons in L-dopa induced dyskinesias","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: L-dopa induced dyskinesias are a debilitating side effect of long-term treatment of Parkinson's disease with the dopamine precursor L-dopa.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is one of the most significant co-morbidities in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) affecting almost half of patients over 30 years of age. CFRD is associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Insulin secretory defects are inherent to CF with diminished and/or delayed insulin responses to oral glucose demonstrated in CF patients both with and without diabetes. Because the islet mass is generally retained in CF therapies to restore insulin secretion will significantly reduce the incidence of CFRD and thus morbidity and mortality. However there are no such therapies because the mechanisms underlying kinetically altered insulin secretion in CF are not known. Oxidative stress and fatty acid perturbations have well-established roles in the pathophysiology of lung disease in CF and type 2 diabetes mellitus but have not been studied in CFRD. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-knockout pig and ferret models developed at the University of Iowa have multi-organ disease similar to humans with CF. However the evolution to CFRD and its severity are different between the two models. At birth both models have abnormal insulin secretion but the concomitant exocrine pancreatic disease is mild in CF ferrets and advanced in CF pigs. Pancreatic disease advances rapidly in CF ferrets after birth and they develop progressive hyperglycemia whereas the pancreatic disease progression is slower in CF pigs and they do not develop hyperglycemia as adults. At birth CF pigs and ferrets have an imbalance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) similar to patients with CF and have markers of pancreatic oxidative stress. Given their varying degrees of exocrine pancreatic disease at birth divergent evolution to CFRD fatty acid alterations similar to CF humans and pancreatic oxidative stress CF ferret and porcine models provide unique and complementary opportunities to investigate the pathogenesis of insulin secretion defects in CF. We hypothesize that the oxidative stress and CF-related PUFA imbalance are key mechanisms that underlie the impaired insulin secretion in CF. We will test this hypothesis in both CF pig and ferret models with the following specific aims: (1) Determine the effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress on insulin secretion in vivo by the CF pancreas; (2) Determine the effect of CF-related PUFA imbalance on insulin secretion in vivo by the CF pancreas; (3) Determine the effect of fatty acid alterations and ROS on insulin secretion by isolated islets. The first aim wil determine the relationship between increased levels of ROS oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in CF pig and ferret pancreas along with correlating the severity of redox changes with insulin secretion. The second aim will determine whether correcting CF-related PUFA imbalance will restore the -cell function in CF pancreas. The third aim will examine the extent to which the fatty acid alterations and oxidative stress are intrinsic mechanisms of impaired insulin secretion in CF islets. The objective of this application is to identify oxidative stress and CF-related PUFA imbalance as key pathways in the pathogenesis of CFRD.","Acetylcysteine;Adult;Affect;Age-Years;Animals;Antioxidants;Apoptosis;Arginine;Birth;Caucasians;Cell Death;Cell physiology;Cells;Comorbidity;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Defect;Dependence;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Disease Progression;Docosahexaenoic Acids;Eicosatrienoic Acid;Equilibrium;Etiology;Evolution;Exocrine pancreas;Failure;Family suidae;Fatty Acids;Ferrets;Functional disorder;Genes;Glucose;Goals;Hereditary Disease;Human;Hyperglycemia;Incidence;Insulin;Intervention;Iowa;Knock-out;Life;Linoleic Acids;Lung;Lung diseases;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mutation;NADPH Oxidase;Newborn Infant;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Oral;Organ;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pancreas;Pancreatic Diseases;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids;Prevention strategy;Process;Reactive Oxygen Species;Respiratory physiology;Role;Severities;Sulfhydryl Compounds;Supplementation;Testing;Universities;acetovanillone;cystic fibrosis patients;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;insulin secretion;islet;mortality;novel;postnatal;pregnant;prenatal;prevent;public health relevance;pulmonary function;response;targeted treatment","Fatty Acid Defects & Oxidative Stress Modulate Islet Function in Cystic Fibrosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and it is associated with increased mortality and rapid decline in lung function.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a new class of antimicrobial drugs based on the fundamental principles of transition state analysis. Rather than ""structure-based"" drug design which is based largely on substrate mimicry transition-state analysis is ""reaction-based"" drug design stemming from a rigorous chemical evaluation of the relevant catalytic chemistry to reveal the enzyme mechanism and the structural changes that stabilize a transition state. Transition state analysis will yield small molecule transition state analogs that closely mimic the transition state structure. For the proposed studies we selected Glutamate Racemase (GR) an increasingly important antimicrobial drug target. GR has been widely validated to be an attractive drug target in numerous pathogenic species. GR-catalyzed racemization is primarily achieved through extensive flexibility which is information that is largely absent from GR crystal structures. Recent studies by our research group have strongly suggested that a more chemically diverse inhibitor space can be discovered against GR by considering its transition state structure in virtual screening campaigns. These studies have produced a potentially powerful approach for the discovery of diverse inhibitory scaffolds with high ligand efficiency which provides a solution to the problems of meeting the relatively narrow requirements of antimicrobial drug space. However the enormous potential of virtual screening methods are significantly hindered by the pronounced failures to relatively rapidly make quality predictions about protein-ligand affinities. This proposal directly fills two significant and related knowledge gaps that hinder discovery of true transition state inhibitors for GR: 1) determination of an experimentally validated transition state structure for GR and the transition state pharmacophore that leads to the ultra tight binding along the reaction trajectory and 2) how to accurately rank-order hits from virtual screening against a highly flexible protein receptor. The successful completion of the proposed studies will enable the discovery and design of novel high efficiency inhibitory scaffolds for flexible enzyme drug targets and thus yield transformative results in the field of drug discovery. The specific aims for this proposal are as follows: Aim 1: An integrated computational approach to solve the rank-order problem for a flexible enzyme drug target: the Flexible Enzyme Receptor Method (FERM) for Steered MD (SMD)-Docking. Aim 2: A FERM Challenge: a conformational inventory of GR using a library of conformationally restricted glutamate analogs (the spiro[3.3]heptane family) Aim 3: Elucidation of the Transition State Pharmacophore for GR (B. subtilis RacE and B. anthracis RacE1 and RacE2) via Kinetic Isotope Effects. Aim 4: Bringing it all together: the application of FERM-SMD Docking against the GR transition state pharmacophore and ground state ensembles.","Adopted;Affinity;Bacillus anthracis;Back;Behavior;Binding;Biological Assay;Charge;Chemicals;Chemistry;Complex;Computer Assisted;Computer Simulation;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Dissociation;Diversity Library;Docking;Drug Design;Drug Targeting;Electrostatics;Enzymes;Equilibrium;Equipment and supply inventories;Evaluation;Failure;Family;Future;Glutamate racemase;Glutamates;Goals;Heptanes;Hybrids;Isotopes;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lead;Libraries;Ligands;Mammalian Cell;Methods;Mining;Modeling;Molecular Conformation;Motion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Physics;Property;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Publishing;Race;Reaction;Research;Resources;Screening Result;Shapes;Solvents;Structure;Testing;Toxic effect;analog;antimicrobial;antimicrobial drug;base;carbanion;computational chemistry;design;drug development;drug discovery;enzyme mechanism;falls;feeding;flexibility;in vitro Assay;inhibitor/antagonist;meetings;mimicry;novel;pharmacophore;programs;racemization;receptor;scaffold;screening;small molecule;small molecule therapeutics;stem;virtual","Exploiting Enzyme Plasticity in Drug Discovery: application to glutamate racemase","There are enormous opportunities to discover novel high potency drugs against enzyme targets by fully capturing the dynamic changes that occur in the enzyme receptor which are related to their intrinsic ultra-tight binding to reaction intermediates.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the Iowa Occupational Health & Safety Surveillance Program (OHSSP) is to promote and protect the health and safety of Iowa workers. Iowa has a current labor force of over 1.7 million workers including roughly 110000 agricultural workers. OHSSP work is significant because occupational health indicators show Iowa workers have a higher than average risk of mortality and morbidity in a number of areas when compared to national averages. The fatality rate for Iowa workers is 1.7 times the national average and increasing. Fatal injuries in agriculture and construction account for 30% and 16% of the total occupational fatalities in Iowa while workers in these sectors comprise only 6% and 4% respectively of the Iowa workforce. In 2010 11% of Iowa workers worked in industries at high risk for occupational morbidity compared to 7% forthe USA and 20% of Iowa workers were employed in occupations (USA 15%) and 14% in industries (USA 12%) with a high risk of occupational mortality. Iowa consistently has a high rate of workers with elevated blood lead levels and pesticide-associated poisonings. Aims of the Iowa OHSSP are to: a) conduct surveillance to track and trend selected occupational health indicators illnesses and injuries inthe state; b) conduct specific project surveillance and case investigations utilizing NIOSH and state protocols and priorities; and c) disseminate technical and lay findings and recommendations through targeted outreach to workers employers safety and health professionals policy makers and the public.  Specific Iowa OHSSP initiatives proposed include an Occupational Health Indicator project with multiple subprojects of national and state importance Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology and Surveillance (ABLES) Pesticides Illness and Injury Surveillance (SENSOR Pesticides) and Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (FACE) surveillance.

This RFA specifically requests that proposals develop and test: 1) methods for assessing theory-derived ESBT fidelity components; and 2) interventions that enhance and maintain the fidelity with which clinicians implement ESBT's in community settings.  In response we propose to conduct a two-phase study involving IPT. Phase I will be a two year project to develop and validate a fidelity instrument to measure the adherence and quality of the delivery of IPT. Specific steps include a review of all available psychotherapy adherence instruments and review of IPT videotapes with qualitative feedback by IPT and other psychotherapy experts with subsequent development of a prototype measure of IPT fidelity. This measure will then be pilot tested using archived samples of IPT from outcome studies allowing us to correlate adherence to specific IPT tactics and techniques to symptomatic and diagnostic outcome. We will develop a final IPT adherence measure which will be used by IPT experts to rate a representative sample of IPT therapy sessions. We will also use the instrument to rate cognitive and psychodynamic therapy sessions as a means of establishing discriminant validity.  Phase II will be a three year project in which the fidelity measure will be used to evaluate 4 different methods of IPT training in the community with the goal of establishing the feasibility of training methods that foster fidelity to IPT and optimize patient outcomes. These methods include a traditional instructor- led didactic training followed by either: 1) individual case supervision; 2) community-based consultation; 3) internet-based training; or 4) an ""autodidactic"" control condition. The IPT training will occur in community mental health agencies serving a diverse and low-income population in Los Angeles and other California communities all of which have a close liaison relationship with the PI.  In sum our goals are to develop and test a measure of the fidelity of IPT treatment delivery which: 1) has content validity; 2) has a high degree of predictive and discriminative validity; 3) is reliable; 4 is comprehensive; 5) reflects the stages of IPT; and 6) is feasible for use in the community.","Adherence;Aftercare;Archives;Behavior Therapy;California;Cognitive Therapy;Communities;Consultations;Data;Demographic Factors;Development;Diagnostic;Discipline;Disease;E-learning;Educational Status;Effectiveness;Elements;Ensure;Feedback;Fostering;Goals;Individual;Intervention;Iowa;Length;Los Angeles;Low Income Population;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Mental disorders;Methods;Michigan;National Institute of Mental Health;Outcome;Outcome Study;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phase;Psychometrics;Psychotherapy;Recovery;Request for Proposals;Research;Research Methodology;Sampling;Staging;Sum;Supervision;Techniques;Testing;Training;Training Programs;Translating;Universities;Videotape;Wisconsin;base;candidate selection;community based treatment;community setting;experience;follow-up;instructor;instrument;interpersonal therapy;programs;prototype;psychodynamic therapy;response;theories","Optimizing Fidelity of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depression","The proposed study will provide critical information about the fidelity of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) and its use in the community.

"Aging; Arthritis; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Osteoarthritis","A Biomechanics and Imaging (B&I) Core is proposed to provide sophisticated technical support to all three CORT projects. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) results from mechanical insult to articular cartilage and it is frequently evaluated based on a variety of imaging features. The members of the Core have an established history of developing mechanics and image analysis methodologies for quantifying particular observations of interest. The B&I Core will support the three CORT projects by achieving two specific aims. The first aim of the Core is to serve as a general technical resource comprised of advanced hardware image analysis protocols and personnel experienced in developing and conducting biomechanical and imaging studies. These general capabilities will be utilized as needed by the different CORT projects to support and complement both ongoing and newly evolving project activities. The second aim of the Core is to provide expert support in the areas of mechanics and image analysis which specifically enhances the work in the three CORT projects. These specialized activities can be broadly classified into four main types: computational mechanics/modeling; physical measurement and hardware design; quantitative MRI analysis; and quantitative evaluation of microscopic-level images.  This variety of multidisciplinary activities best fits within the structure of a core that can support all three CORT projects simultaneously. The B&I Core provides an explicit point of overlap between the various aims of the three research projects which allows for opportunities for the different projects to inform each other better than if the individual Core activities were segregated in the different projects. A combined mechanics and imaging core also facilitates development of unique multi-modal (e.g. stress analysis and imaging) and multi-scale (e.g. histological to clinical) imaging comparisons which are critical to translating basic research into the clinical setting.","Adopted;Area;Basic Science;Biomechanics;Categories;Cellular biology;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complement;Computational Technique;Computer Simulation;Degenerative polyarthritis;Development;Disease;Elements;Environment;Equipment;Fostering;Goals;Histology;Human Resources;Image;Image Analysis;Individual;Joints;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Mechanical Stress;Mechanics;Methodology;Microscopic;Modeling;Molecular Biology;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;Patients;Process;Protocols documentation;Quantitative Evaluations;Recording of previous events;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resources;Role;Running;Stress;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Translating;Validation;Work;articular cartilage;base;design;experience;falls;in vivo;in vivo Model;innovation;instrumentation;interest;meetings;member;multidisciplinary;novel;prevent","Biomechanics and Imaging Core","Post-traumatic osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease resulting from a mechanical insult to a joint.

"Aging; Arthritis; Bioengineering; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Osteoarthritis; Prevention","Elevated joint contact stress from residual articular incongruity following intra-articular fracture (IAF) is a critically important risk factor for post-traumatic OA (PTOA) that until recently could not be assessed presenting a major obstacle to meaningful research aimed at improving treatment. The goals of the proposed research are to employ a clinically applicable measure of contact stress obtained using computational discrete element analysis (DEA) methods to diagnose patients at risk of PTOA following IAF and to develop and test methods of preventing elevated contact stress from joint incongruity. In retrospective studies of different lower extremity joints DEA will be utilized to identify thresholds of joint contact stress above which PTOA is most highly likely (Specific Aim 1). To advance understanding of how elevated cumulative contact stress after IAF affects joint structure and biology to cause PTOA prospective studies will be undertaken to correlate contact stress levels with morphologic articular surface changes detected on MRI with alterations in serum and urine biomarkers with radiographic changes and with patient pain and function (Aim 2). The other two aims of this study will make important clinical steps to prevent elevated contact stress following IAF and thereby improve patient outcomes. New intra-operative techniques will be developed to assess the contact stress exposure associated with a given candidate IAF reduction during operations to inform surgeons in their decision-making. These novel techniques will be based on deduced fragment poses from fluoroscopic images correlated with pre-operative CT models; contact stress estimates will be calculated with DEA. These techniques will be assessed on simulated fracture models and piloted in the operating room during IAF surgery and compared with conventional treatment (Aim 3). In a pilot clinical feasibility study acute joint distraction using a ring fixator for severe tibial pilon fractures will be assessed using DEA MRI and biomarkers to determine if temporarily sparing damaged articular surfaces from harmful joint contact stress after injury improves joint healing in such high energy IAFs (Aim 4).","Acetabulum Fracture;Acute;Affect;Aftercare;Ankle;Biological Markers;Biology;Biomechanics;Caring;Cartilage;Clinical;Clinical Research;Complement;Computer Simulation;Decision Making;Defect;Degenerative polyarthritis;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Distal;Elements;External Fixation Devices;Feasibility Studies;Fracture;Goals;Hand;Healed;Health;Image;Injury;Intervention;Joints;Knee;Lead;Lower Extremity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Morphology;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;Operating Rooms;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pain;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Postoperative Period;Prevention;Prospective Studies;Research;Residual state;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Series;Serum;Site;Staging;Stress;Structure;Surface;Surgeon;Techniques;Testing;Thick;Time;Urine;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;bone;calcaneum;conventional therapy;distraction;follow-up;healing;improved;innovation;insight;joint injury;joint stress;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;operation;patient population;patient stratification;prevent;tibia;tool","Diagnosing the Treating Elevated Joint Contact Stress to Avert Post-Traumatic OA","Completion of these studies has the potential to change how IAFs are assessed and treated.

"Aging; Arthritis; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Osteoarthritis; Prevention","This project is designed to establish novel treatments to decrease the risk of PTOA and to investigate new diagnostic tools to identify patients at high risk of PTOA. The goal is to provide effective immediate preclinical information to support clinical application of these treatments and diagnostic tools. The treatments of interest are: 1) cytoprotective treatment that prevents immediate necrotic and acute apoptotic chondrocyte death at/near a site of acute cartilage injury and 2) chondrocyte metabolic enhancement treatment developed to improve chondrocyte energy production to restore anabolic function and to suppress catabolic activities by modulating the injury-related acute inflammatory response. These treatments will be piloted using a survival rabbit model. In this model after controlled surgical insults that replicate major factors contributing to pathogenesis of human PTOA following joint injuries (i.e. acute joint injury and excessive cumulative mechanical stress to the injured cartilage) progressive cartilage loss predictably develops in the experimental joints (knees) in a relatively short period (8 weeks). Using this animal model of rapid-progression PTOA work is proposed to test if the above treatments are capable of mitigating the early biologically mediated disease process of PTOA in vivo and whether the treatments effectively decrease subsequent cartilage loss.  The diagnostic tools of interest are: 1) MR imaging that visualizes/measures inflammatory anatomical changes and early intra-cartilage degenerative changes prior to cartilage loss and 2) molecular biomarker analysis that measures whole-joint inflammation and whole-joint cartilage metabolic activity. The diagnostic power of these clinically applicable non- or minimally-invasive tools will be tested in a goat survival model of acute cartilage injury (created by means of precisely controlled blunt impaction insult). Work is proposed to test if these tools are capable of characterizing the severity of acute joint injury in vivo (particularly focusing on cartilage damage) and to test if subsequent progression of cartilage loss in these joints is reliably predictable using the early (< 1 month) information provided by these diagnostic tools.","Acute;Animal Model;Animals;Ankle;Apoptotic;Arthritis;Basic Science;Cartilage;Cartilage injury;Cell Death;Cessation of life;Chondrocytes;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Data;Degenerative polyarthritis;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Early identification;Experimental Models;Fracture;Goals;Goat;Healed;Health;Hour;Human;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Injury;Intervention;Joints;Knee;Knee joint;Laboratories;Lead;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mechanical Stress;Mechanics;Mediating;Metabolic;Methods;Modeling;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;Necrosis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Orthopedics;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Outcome;Outcome Study;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Phase;Process;Production;Residual state;Risk;Severities;Site;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Time;Translating;Translational Research;Work;articular cartilage;clinical application;design;effective therapy;healing;high risk;imaging biomarker;improved;in vivo;injured;innovation;interest;joint injury;minimally invasive;molecular marker;novel;novel diagnostics;pre-clinical;prevent;tool;treatment strategy","Establishing Treatments and Diagnostic Tools for Post-Traumatic OA in Vivo","This project will provide preclinical evidence that supports promise of a novel acute treatment strategy to effectively ameliorate the disease process of PTOA and it will demonstrate the capability of the diagnostic methods to identify patients at high risk of PTOA.

"Aging; Arthritis; Biotechnology; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Osteoarthritis; Prevention","Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is characterized by progressive articular cartilage erosion initiated by a variety of joint injuries ranging in severity from non-contact anterior cruciate ligament tears (ACLT) to intra-articular fracture (IAF). Even in the case of IAF the immediate damage to cartilage and chondrocytes typically amounts to only a few percent of the joint surface. Yet such localized lesions can expand over time; a phenomenon associated with release of mediators from injured cartilage. However cartilage erosion also occurs away from originally damaged cartilage indicating that catabolic factors carried in synovial fluid initiate degeneration in undamaged cartilage. Thus an intervention centered on preventing trauma-induced inflammation holds great potential for reducing trauma-induced cartilage loss. Mechanical injuries to articular cartilage cause the death of chondrocytes and matrix degeneration in injury sites and over time in adjacent cartilage. Matrix fragments and cell debris signaling tissue damage (known collectively as ""alarmins"") induce catabolic responses via innate immune receptors expressed by chondrocytes synoviocytes and other cells in the joint. In addition to their tissue-level effects alarmins exert organ-level effects by recruiting monocytes and neutrophils to damaged tissues. This implies that abatement of alarmin signaling will prevent not just local catabolic effects in cartilage but also the development of destructive whole-joint inflammation. For these reasons targeting alarmins is a promising strategy for cartilage preservation in injured joints. Support for this comes from trauma models which show that blocking chondrocyte death by any of several means appears to slow or block cartilage loss and from studies describing the anti-inflammatory and tissue-sparing effects of innate immune-suppressive drugs in numerous other organ systems. Based on these precedents we propose to investigate the potential of cell death inhibitors and innate immune/alarmin-targeted therapies to prevent progressive cartilage loss in mice with intra-articular fractures. In the first aim transgenic mice with single gene knockouts affecting alarmin or cytokine signaling will be studied. In the second aim upstream and downstream inhibitors will be used to simultaneously block multiple pathways. A gene therapy strategy for long-term suppression of alarmin or cytokine production will be tested in Aim 3. In the last aim human reference data will be obtained by measuring alarmin and cytokine levels in patients with intra-articular fractures or anterior cruciate ligament tears.","Acute;Address;Affect;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Arthritis;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biological Preservation;Cartilage;Cause of Death;Cell Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Chondrocytes;Chronic;Cytokine Signaling;Data;Degenerative polyarthritis;Dependovirus;Development;Diagnostic;Drug Targeting;Early Intervention;Erythropoietin;FDA approved;Fracture;Genes;Goals;Histologic;Human;Immune;Immunologic Receptors;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Injury;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 Receptors;Interleukins;Intervention;Intra-Articular Injections;Joints;Knee;Knee Fracture;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Lead;Liquid substance;Localized Lesion;MAPK14 gene;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mechanics;Medial;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Meniscus structure of joint;Mind;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;Organ;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase I Clinical Trials;Production;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Design;Role;Serum;Severities;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Surface;Synovial Fluid;Synovitis;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;Trauma;Wild Type Mouse;anterior cruciate ligament rupture;articular cartilage;base;body system;cartilage degradation;cell injury;cytokine;design;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;gene therapy;inhibitor/antagonist;injured;innovation;joint destruction;joint injury;knockout gene;monocyte;neutrophil;prevent;receptor;repository;research clinical testing;response;response to injury;soft tissue;targeted treatment","Targeting the Origins of Inflammation in Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis","This research is designed to generate new critically needed treatments to suppress the development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis in a wide variety of joint injuries.

"Aging; Arthritis; Osteoarthritis; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research","Osteoarthritis (OA) is among the most common causes of pain and disability in middle age and older individuals. More than 12% of lower limb OA is caused by joint injury. This OA subset referred to as posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) frequently affects young adults and can result in impairment comparable to that of advanced cardiac and kidney disease. The theme of the University of Iowa CORT Innovations to Assess and Forestall Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis is that greater understanding of how joint injury and cumulative excessive articular surface contact stress due to post-traumatic joint instability and incongruity cause PTOA will lead to innovations in the assessment and treatment of joint injuries which in turn will lead to effective strategies to forestall the disease. Information gained from CORT investigations from the molecular level to the level of a patient with a joint injury with emphasis on how acute joint injuries trigger joint responses that cause progressive tissue damage and on how cumulative excessive mechanical stress leads to articular cartilage loss will contribute to the understanding of the onset and progression of OA in people without a history of joint injury. The multidisciplinary team of CORT investigators including biologists bioengineers and clinicians has developed a unique research base that will allow them to make rapid progress in translating basic research into improved clinical practice. CORT investigators and advisors have identified three critical research advances needed to move forward in forestalling OA in injured joints: 1) understanding of in vivo whole joint cellular and molecular processes that lead to PTOA 2) clinically applicable diagnostic methods that reliably identify patients who will develop PTOA and 3) biological and mechanical methods of preventing PTOA. Three projects were developed to realize these advances: 1)Targeting the Origins of Inflammation in Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis 2) Establishing Treatments and Diagnostic Tools for Post-Traumatic OA In Vivo and 3) Diagnosing and Preventing Elevated Contact Stress to Avert Post-Traumatic OA. Three cores will support the projects: 1) Administrative Biostatistics and Investigator Support Core 2) Joint Trauma Biomarker Core and 3) Biomechanics and Imaging Core.","Acute;Affect;Basic Science;Biological;Biological Markers;Biomechanics;Biomedical Engineering;Biometry;Degenerative polyarthritis;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Disease;Economics;Heart Diseases;Image;Impairment;Individual;Inflammation;Investigation;Iowa;Joint Instability;Joints;Kidney Diseases;Lead;Lower Extremity;Mechanical Stress;Mechanics;Methods;Molecular;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;Pain;Patients;Process;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Stress;Surface;Tissues;Translating;Universities;arthropathies;articular cartilage;base;clinical practice;disability;improved;in vivo;injured;innovation;joint injury;middle age;multidisciplinary;prevent;response;tool;young adult","Overall Application","n/a","NIAMS","9133272","8/25/2016","RFA-AR-11-002","4P50AR055533-10","4","P50","AR","055533","10","",""," ","8/31/2018","ZAR1-KM","5560","1866797","BUCKWALTER, JOSEPH A.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2016","6/30/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","128187"," ","111777","57235"," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","The goal of the University of Iowa CORT is to develop new methods of forestalling post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) through a multi-disciplinary translational approach including basic science bioengineering imaging and clinical research. The central theme is that joint injuries initiate a sequence of biologic events that lead to PTOA and that new treatments of joint injuries will minimize these deleterious events and promote joint healing. The specific aims are to: 1) advance understanding of the pathogenesis of PTOA 2) develop and refine reliable quantitative measures of severity of joint injuries including measures of structural damage and biologic response to joint injury and 3) apply the advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of PTOA and assessment of joint injury to new methods of forestalling PTOA. The four CORT projects are: 1. Cartilage Extracellular Matrix Fragments and Trauma-Induced Chondrolysis an in vitro study that will identify pathways responsible for propagation of cell damage following injury; 2. Acute versus Chronic Mechanical Damage in the Etiology of PTOA an experimental study that will define the role of loading of injured joints in causing OA and new methods for preventing OA in injured joints; 3. Validation and Application of MRI Biomarkers in Assessing Articular Cartilage Health a clinical and experimental study of non-fracture cartilage injury that will help define the ability of non-invasive measures to assess the severity of cartilage damage that will identify which synovial fluid markers of acute joint injury reflect that damage and that will test the hypothesis that decreased loading accelerates restoration of injured joint surfaces; and 4. Quantifying Injury Severity to Assess the Risk for Post-Traumatic OA a clinical study of intra-articular fractures that will examine the hypothesis that new quantitative measures of the severity of structural joint injury predict clinical outcomes. This project also will conduct a multi-center study of the severity of joint injury in preparation for clinical trials of molecular interventions to minimize the risk of OA following joint injury. The four projects will be supported by an administrative-biostatistics core a biomechanics-imaging core and a tissue and experimental modeling core.","Acute;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Biomechanics;Biomedical Engineering;Biostatistics Core;Cartilage;Cartilage injury;Chronic;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Degenerative polyarthritis;Etiology;Event;Experimental Models;Extracellular Matrix;Fracture;Goals;Healed;Health;Image;In Vitro;Injury;Intervention;Iowa;Joints;Lead;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Mechanics;Methods;Molecular;Multicenter Studies;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Preparation;Risk;Role;Severities;Surface;Synovial Fluid;Testing;Tissue Model;Trauma;Universities;Validation;articular cartilage;cell injury;healing;injured;innovation;joint injury;predict clinical outcome;prevent;research study;response;restoration;translational approach","NIAMS: CORT Innovations to Assess and Forestall Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis","n/a","NIAMS","9133269","8/25/2016","RFA-AR-11-002","4P50AR055533-10","4","P50","AR","055533","10","","ZHENG, XINCHENG ","9/10/2007","8/31/2018","ZAR1-KM(M1)"," ","1866797","BUCKWALTER, JOSEPH A.","Not Applicable","01","ORTHOPEDICS","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2016","8/31/2018"," ","846","Research Centers","2016","1385675"," ","NIAMS","1097089","533531"," ","1385675",
"Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Epilepsy; Heart Disease; Lung; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy estimated to account for up to 50% of all deaths in this population and up to 17% of deaths in all patients with epilepsy. There is a surprisingly common lack of awareness among patients and physicians of this increased risk of sudden death. In a recent survey only 56% of Canadian pediatricians who treat patients with epilepsy knew their patients were at increased risk for sudden death and only 33% of these physicians knew the term SUDEP. There is controversy regarding whether cardiac failure or respiratory arrest is more important as the primary cause of death but cardiac and respiratory data is rarely collected simultaneously from human cases of SUDEP or from mouse models. For example in the more than 20 documented cases of SUDEP that occurred while the patient was undergoing EMU monitoring none of these patients had measurements of ventilation or even blood oxygenation. Effective preventive strategies in high-risk epileptic patients will rely on defining the mechanisms that lead from seizures to death. Our preliminary data suggest that respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in some cases of SUDEP and that patients with Dravet syndrome have previously uncharacterized breathing abnormalities in the peri-ictal period. Furthermore our data has indicated there is an anatomical pathway that inhibits ventilation which extends from the amygdala and anterior temporal lobe to medullary nuclei that control breathing. However it is unclear how this circuit is connected and the identities of the neurons involved. In Aim 1 we will characterize peri-ictal cardiorespiratory control in human patients with Dravet syndrome as well as mouse models of this pathology. In Aim 2 we will define the anatomical pathway from the amygdala to the brainstem that inhibits the cardiovascular and respiratory control networks during seizures. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine the identity of brainstem neurons that receive inputs from the amygdala and inhibit breathing and consciousness during seizures. This work will identify an anatomical pathway by which cortical seizures can invade the midbrain and brainstem and cause depressed cardiorespiratory function and arousal. Our findings have the potential to characterize key components of this circuit and may identify biomarkers that can be used to develop effective screening strategies. Better understanding mechanisms that underlie SUDEP will allow future development of preventative treatments that may decrease SUDEP risk.","Accounting;Acetylcholine;Agonist;Amygdaloid structure;Anterior;Apnea;Arousal;Arrhythmia;Awareness;Biological Markers;Blood;Brain;Brain Stem;Breathing;Cardiac;Cardiovascular system;Cause of Death;Cell Nucleus;Cessation of life;Chronic;Coma;Conscious;Data;Defect;Depressed mood;Development;Diagnosis;Electrocardiogram;Electroencephalography;Environmental air flow;Epilepsy;Forensic Medicine;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Future;Goals;Heart failure;Human;Hypercapnic respiratory failure;Incidence;Invaded;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Measurement;Measures;Mental Depression;Midbrain structure;Monitor;Mus;Myocardial dysfunction;Neurobiology;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Oxygen;Partial Epilepsies;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacology;Physicians;Play;Population;Prevention strategy;Preventive Intervention;Preventive treatment;Prosencephalon;Refractory;Research;Respiration;Risk;Role;Seizures;Serotonin;Slice;Sudden Death;Sudden infant death syndrome;Surveys;Synapses;Syndrome;System;Temporal Lobe;Transgenic Mice;Ventilatory Depression;Work;base;cholinergic neuron;high risk;monoamine;mortality;mouse model;novel;optogenetics;pediatrician;prevent;public health relevance;receptor;respiratory;response;screening;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy","SUDEP Research Alliance: Respiratory and Arousal Mechanisms Application 5 of 7","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: SUDEP is a major cause of death in patients with epilepsy by some estimates accounting for up to 50% of mortality in patients with chronic refractory epilepsy.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Substance Abuse","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heavy alcohol use is common and presents a major social/economic challenge. Although chronic use of small amounts of alcohol is not always harmful heavier use (>2 drinks/day) is generally harmful and frequently leads to alcoholism or as it is termed in ICD-10 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). AUD affects ~25% of the U.S. population and causes over $200 billion/yr of economic damage. In addition alcohol use in critical situations presents potentially grave consequences whose impacts cannot be measured. These adverse outcomes are avoidable if heavy alcohol consumption is spotted early; however current screening methods for chronic alcohol use capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive non-specific protein assays. A next-generation method that could more reliably identify heavy alcohol consumption and monitor abstinence would be of great interest to a large number of companies and groups including medical governmental security and transportation agencies. Developing validating and commercializing such a next- generation technology is Behavioral Diagnostic's overall goal.  In a very successful R43 application using relatively healthy alcoholics we recently demonstrated that DNA methylation assessment can robustly identify heavy consumers of alcohol. In this Phase II application we plan on completing the initial commercialization of this disruptive technology by creating and testing a select group of quantitative PCR (qPCR) markers in an ethnically and medically diverse group of subjects then selecting the most predictive markers of heavy alcohol consumption for inclusion in first generation commercial array. Specifically we will construct a set of 20 qPCR assays for the most predictive loci. Simultaneously we will collect 250 subjects admitted for the treatment of alcoholism and 250 controls. We will then test these qPCR markers using these DNA from these 500 subjects. Then we will extend these findings using DNA from 2000 other subjects already characterized for alcohol intake. The most predictive markers will be incorporated into commercial array produced in collaboration with Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) the largest world's commercial manufacturer of oligonucleotide products.  Behavioral Diagnostics is ideally poised to develop and commercialize this disruptive technology. Our scientific team is the international leader in substance use epigenetics. The Phase II team is led by Dr. Rob Philibert the Chief Scientific Officer who is an internationally known expert in substance use epigenetics. The CFO and CEO are experienced corporate executives. The board will include leading corporate and academic figures. The intellectual property is already controlled by the company. The array development pathway will be GLP/CLIA compliant and leverage strategic alliances with internationally known companies. A strong plan for market entry has been devised and the product will complement a recently patented highly sensitive and specific test for the quantification of smoking.      ","Abstinence;Admission activity;Affect;Alcohol consumption;Alcohol or Other Drugs use;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Algorithms;Automobile Driving;Behavioral;Biological Assay;CLIA certified;Chronic;Clinical;Collaborations;Complement;Consumption;DNA;DNA Methylation;Data;Data Analyses;Databases;Detection;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Dose;Economics;Epigenetic Process;Future;Generations;Glucose;Goals;Hair;Health Personnel;Heavy Drinking;Hemoglobin;Hour;Hypertension;Intellectual Property;International;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Tenth Revision (ICD-10);Legal patent;Manufacturer Name;Marketing;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Methods;Methylation;Oligonucleotides;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Phase;Population;Proteins;Saliva;Sampling;Security;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serum;Smoking;Spottings;Subgroup;Technology;Testing;Translating;Transportation;Tube;United States National Institutes of Health;Whole Blood;adverse outcome;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol monitoring;alcohol use disorder;alcoholism therapy;base;biobank;case control;chronic alcohol ingestion;commercialization;diabetic;drinking;experience;genome wide methylation;genome-wide;genome-wide analysis;improved;interest;methylation biomarker;next generation;predictive marker;problem drinker;public health relevance;response;screening;social","Quantitative PCR Platform for The Assessment of Alcohol Consumption","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this application is to produce a set of quantitative PCR assays that can be used to detect heavy chronic alcohol consumption in whole blood.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated by protein misfolding stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and it culminates in the transcriptional upregulation of ER chaperones degradation factors and other genes that help the organelle properly fold or degrade client proteins. However nutritional flux can elicit ER stress in metabolic tissues such as the liver and the UPR can in turn regulate metabolic pathways. A number of diseases are associated with both altered metabolism and chronic ER stress most notably including obesity and its complications. Therefore it is important to understand how the UPR regulates metabolism and how metabolic flux influences the ER protein processing capacity.  Data presented in this proposal show that ER stress in the liver leads to transcriptional suppression of fatty acid oxidation and that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation alters the oxidizing environment of the ER and protects hepatocytes from stress. These findings suggest that the regulation of fatty acid oxidation by the UPR represents a novel pathway by which the response protects ER function during stress. Yet very little is known about the mechanisms by which the UPR represses rather than activates transcription. Nor is it known how flux through metabolic pathways influences the ER protein folding and processing capacity. Thus the objective of this work is to understand how ER stress regulates fatty acid oxidation how fatty acid oxidation regulates ER function and how these pathways interact during feeding and fasting. The work in this proposal tests the central hypothesis that ER stress leads to direct transcriptional suppression of fatty acid oxidation through the UPR-regulated transcription factor CHOP and that this in turn alters the oxidative protein folding capacity of the ER to alleviate stress. This hypothesis will be tested by three complementary aims. The first aim will elucidate the gene regulatory network by which the UPR regulates fatty acid oxidation. The role of CHOP in this network will be tested as will the interactions of CHOP with other C/EBP-family transcription factors and the impact of CHOP action on the master regulators of fatty acid oxidation. In the second aim the ability of the ER to efficiently import fold modify oxidize transport and degrade client proteins will be systematically examined when fatty acid oxidation is manipulated and the roles of NADPH and glutathione redox in linking fatty acid oxidation to ER function will be tested. The third aim will determine how the relationship between fatty acid oxidation and ER protein processing contributes to the regulation of metabolic activity and ER stress during feeding and fasting. The contribution of CHOP to the suppression of fatty acid oxidation during feeding and its enhancement during fasting will be tested as will the effects of manipulating fatty acid oxidation NADPH generation and glutathione oxidation on ER function. Together these aims will form a cross-disciplinary approach linking ER protein folding UPR signaling lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis.","Affect;American;Binding;CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha;CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins;Catabolism;Chronic;Client;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Environment;Family;Fasting;Gene Expression;Generations;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Glutathione;Goals;Grant;Health;Hepatocyte;Homeostasis;In Vitro;Lead;Link;Lipids;Liver;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Molecular Chaperones;NADP;Nutritional;Obesity;Organelles;Oxidation-Reduction;PPAR alpha;Pathway interactions;Phenocopy;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Process;Production;Protein Import;Proteins;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Repression;Role;Signal Transduction;Stress;Symptoms;Testing;Tissues;Up-Regulation;Work;disulfide bond;endoplasmic reticulum stress;fatty acid oxidation;feeding;human disease;improved;in vivo;lipid metabolism;novel;oxidation;promoter;protein folding;protein misfolding;research study;response;sensor;transcription factor;transcription factor CHOP","Regulation of Fatty Acid Oxidation during ER stress: mechanisms and consequences","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A number of very common human diseases are associated with both dysregulated lipid metabolism and chronic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress including obesity and the constellation of symptoms included under the umbrella of the Metabolic Syndrome which affect approximately 50 million Americans.

Thus by understanding how ER stress and lipid catabolism are linked and how this relationship contributes to metabolic regulation during feeding and fasting this work will help to elucidate the role of ER stress signaling in the lipid dysregulation that accompanies metabolic disease.","NIGMS","9131769","5/31/2016","PA-13-302","5R01GM115424-02","5","R01","GM","115424","02","","GINDHART, JOSEPH G","9/1/2015","6/30/2019","Membrane Biology and Protein Processing Study Section[MBPP]"," ","8085848","RUTKOWSKI, DAVID THOMAS","Not Applicable","01","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," ","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","301188"," ","NIGMS","197500","103688"," ","301188",
"No NIH Category available","Iowa Project Summary/Abstract (tissue)Given the large impact of Iowas feed manufacturing industry providing information througheducation about the prevention of drug residue based on the scientific principles of feed/foodsafety is paramount to protecting Iowans and consumers throughout the nation and world.Furthermore the President has provided a significant level of focus on food safety nationally ashas Congress with the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). Similarly withinIowa we have found an added interest in food safety.Speaking to groups to provide information through education is a large part of what our Bureauhas identified to be successful with the FDA Drug Residue Cooperative Agreement Program.Initially the Bureau will restructure duties of existing staff to allow us time to evaluate if a newstaff person is needed to assist in this area. We will start by getting involved with personalappearances in the agriculture classes at the States Universities Colleges Junior Colleges andeven the High Schools. We will use willing subject matter experts from around the country viawebinars. We will educate our inspectors about the prevention of drug resides. We will developdrug residue prevention material that will include a survey which our inspectors will hand out atall of our 500+ inspections throughout the year. Our inspectors will be properly trained so theycan answer any questions that they may receive. We will enhance and make available theexisting pamphlets that are already being used by the Animal Industry Bureau or we will createour own. We will make sure the information can be relayed to the public in a manner than canbe understood. We will make available the drug residue materials at State and County Fairs aswell as being involved with mailings. We will record an event/webinar of a training seminar andpost it on-line so it can be available to anyone at any time. The recorded seminar along with theinformational pamphlets will be posted on our website so they will be available to everyone(including FDA) and will continue to be available after the end of the agreement.The objective of this agreement is intended to ensure that IDALS develops a drug residueprevention program to protect consumer exposure to drug residues in the edible products offood animals.

"Biodefense; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are at the front-line of cellular innate immune-mediated host defense against infection especially those caused by organisms such as S. aureus (SA). Despite the potent PMN antimicrobial system 10-20% of ingested SA remained viable but not replicating in PMN. Persistence of SA within PMN has profound clinical consequences as signature features of staphylococcal infection are relapse metastases and failure of antibiotics to which SA are susceptible.  In our ongoing studies of the fate of SA-laden human PMN and their interactions with monocyte-derived macrophages (M) we have made several novel findings: PMN-SA (1) early after phagocytosis of SA display a phenotype that is atypical for pathogen-induced apoptosis; (2) are not efficiently efferocytosed by M; (3) maintain sustained levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) a cell-cycle protein expressed in PMN cytoplasm and recently linked to prolonging PMN survival by scavenging procaspases; and (4) lyse in a fashion most consistent with necroptosis a caspase-independent programmed necrotic cell death pathway never previously described in PMN but involving a multicomponent cytoplasmic signaling complex and dependence on receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1K). We reason that these cellular events in and between PMN-SA and M drive the clinical hallmarks of SA infection and propose studies to explore of the mechanisms underlying our novel observations. Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms underlying the failed efferocytosis of PMN-SA by M 1A: Identify signals generated by PMN-SA that promote efferocytosis by M 1B: Identify signals generated by PMN-SA that actively block efferocytosis by M 1C: Identify signaling pathways and effector responses of M challenged with PMN-SA 1D: Determine the role of ectosomes generated by PMN-SA to modulate efferocytosis by M Aim 2: Identify cellular components biochemical events and signaling pathways underlying necroptosis of PMN-SA  2A: Determine the composition and regulation of the ripoptosome in PMN-SA  2B: Determine the contribution of PCNA to the initial prolonged survival and eventual lysis of PMN-SA  2C: Determine the signaling pathways engaged as PMN-SA proceed to necroptosis  2D: Determine the role of TNF-dependent signaling in necroptosis of PMN-SA  Our studies will identify mechanisms responsible for the atypical apoptosis failed efferocytosis and necrotic death of PMN-SA thereby providing novel insights into fundamental aspects of phagocyte control of the inflammatory response and new potential therapeutic targets.","Affect;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Binding;Biochemical;Biology;Caspase;Cell Cycle Proteins;Cell Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Clinical;Clinical Data;Communities;Complex;Cytolysis;Cytoplasm;Cytoplasmic Granules;Data;Dependence;Disease;Environment;Epidemic;Equus caballus;Event;Exhibits;Experimental Models;Extensive Necrosis;Failure;Genus staphylococcus;Health;Host Defense;Human;Immune;Immune system;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory Response;Ingestion;Invaded;Link;Lung;Mediating;Membrane;Microbe;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;NADPH Oxidase;Necrosis;Neoplasm Metastasis;Organism;Oxidants;Pathway interactions;Phagocytes;Phagocytosis;Phagosomes;Phenotype;Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen;Protein Kinase;Proteins;RIPK1 gene;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Relapse;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Skin;Staphylococcal Infections;Staphylococcus aureus;Supportive care;System;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Work;antimicrobial;base;cytokine;innovation;insight;macrophage;methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus;microbicide;microorganism;monocyte;mortality;neutrophil;novel;pathogen;programs;response;therapeutic target","Consequences of interactions between human neutrophils and Staphylococcus aureus","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite antibiotic therapy and supportive care human infections with Staphylococcus aureus cause significant morbidity and mortality with metastases persistence and tissue necrosis being the hallmarks of staphylococcal disease.

Based on our novel observation that human neutrophils harboring viable S. aureus undergo a specific form of programmed cell death (i.e. necroptosis) we propose studies to comprehensively analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the fate of neutrophils harboring viable organisms reasoning that the release of cellular contents that occurs when neutrophils lyse amplify inflammation and contribute to the tissue necrosis seen clinically.

"Chronic Liver Disease and Cirrhosis; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease; Nutrition","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are closely linked yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these pathologies are poorly understood. Currently no treatment exists for individuals diagnosed with NAFLD. We have identified Tox (thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box) as a hepatic transcription factor that is strongly induced during NAFLD. We have also identified that the whole-body deletion of Tox in mice prevents the development of NAFLD suggesting that Tox plays a crucial role in mediating central metabolism. However the metabolic effects of Tox specifically in hepatic metabolism and the consequent effects on the development of NAFLD have not been reported. We therefore hypothesize that the inhibition of hepatic Tox expression will prevent NAFLD thus offering a novel target in the treatment of NAFLD. This proposal employs novel mouse genetic models and state of the art NMR techniques to address the link between Tox hepatic metabolism and NAFLD.","Address;Adult;Affect;Alcohol consumption;American;Boxing;Cirrhosis;Clinical;Cre-LoxP;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diet;Disease;Dyslipidemias;Epidemic;Fatty Liver;Genetic;Genetic Models;Goals;Hepatic;Hyperglycemia;Hyperinsulinism;Individual;Inflammatory Response;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Investigation;Knockout Mice;Link;Liver;Liver diseases;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Names;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance;Obesity;Pathology;Patients;Play;Prevalence;Reporting;Repression;Resistance;Rodent;Role;Severities;Techniques;Testing;Thymocyte Selection;base;combat;glucose metabolism;hepatic gluconeogenesis;improved;insight;insulin sensitivity;lipid biosynthesis;lipid metabolism;liver metabolism;mRNA Expression;mitochondrial metabolism;new therapeutic target;non-alcoholic fatty liver;nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;prevent;public health relevance;therapeutic target;transcription factor","A Novel Therapeutic Approach to Combat Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The number of Americans afflicted by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is alarming and no treatment currently exists.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Genetics; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative; Prevention; Smoking and Health; Substance Abuse; Tobacco","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the most common preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. For 90% of adult smokers this addiction began in adolescence. Effective interventions to block the escalation of this initial smoking in adolescentsexist. However the implementation and effectiveness of these interventions are hindered by the inability of current biomarkers to detect periodic use of cigarettes. This substantial problem has recently made substantially worse by the introduction of e-cigarettes whose active ingredient nicotine is also metabolized to cotinine. As result clinicians cannot determine which adolescents are smoking nor can scientists reliably determine whether e-cigarette usage is leading to increased rates of adolescent smoking.  Recently using a blood based approach; Behavioral Diagnostic Inc (BDI) has developed a epigenetic biomarker referred to as Smoke Signature(tm) that can sensitively and specifically detect cigarette smoking consumption even in the face of e-cigarette use in adults. This patented biomarker assesses the methylation level at a CpG residue in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor referred to as cg05575921 to determine smoking status. The robust sensitivity and specificity of this response of this locus to smoking has been demonstrated in over 40 publications by ourselves and others using tens of thousands of samples. However since almost all the previous studies have been performed using DNA isolated from blood and the exact shape of the dose response curve in saliva DNA is not known we are unable to push forward with our efforts to develop a saliva based kit that could be used 1) scientifically to evaluate the effects of e-cigarettes and 2) clinically to screen adolescents for behavioral intervention and monitor their response to treatment.  In Phase I of this Fast Track application we will take advantage of 1) our already developed quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays 2) data showing that cg05575921 methylation in blood and saliva is highly correlated and 3) our already tested saliva kit ingredients to confirm the feasibility of our salia based approach and the equivalence of our saliva DNA kits. In Phase II we will determine the sensitivity and specificity of our method for detecting smoking using a two qPCR marker set that includes Smoke Signature and a second marker that compensates for the cellular heterogeneity of saliva.  Our plan is highly feasible because the expertise of BDI's expertise in epigenetics ou possession of intellectual property rights and our strong team of commercial collaborators that includes established companies to manufacture and co-market the products (IBI Scientific and IDT). It is innovative because the techniques are state of the art and quantitative epigenetic tests are new to the market. As a direct result of this research we will produce a kit suitable forresearchers interested in smoking and the effects of e-cigarettes on the rate of smoking while gaining valuable data that can be used in a future FDA application.      ","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Age;Ally;Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor;Behavior Therapy;Behavior monitoring;Behavioral;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Caring;Cigarette;Clinical;Collection;Consumption;Cotinine;DNA;DNA Methylation;Data;Dentists;Dependency;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Doctor of Philosophy;Dose;Effectiveness of Interventions;Electronic cigarette;Epigenetic Process;Fostering;Funding;Future;Generations;Goals;Habits;Health Personnel;Health Professional;Heterogeneity;Intellectual Property;Intervention;Lead;Legal patent;Longitudinal Studies;Marketing;Methods;Methylation;Morbidity - disease rate;Nicotine;Oligonucleotides;Patients;Pharmacists;Phase;Prevention;Preventive Intervention;Process;Property Rights;Publications;Reagent;Receiver Operating Characteristics;Research;Research Personnel;Rest;Risk;Saliva;Salivary;Sampling;Scientist;Sensitivity and Specificity;Serum;Shapes;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;Smoking Behavior;Smoking Status;Specialist;Techniques;Teenagers;Testing;United States;addiction;adolescent smoking;base;cigarette smoking;cohort;commercialization;effective intervention;epigenetic marker;innovation;interest;methylation biomarker;mortality;pediatrician;profession allied to medicine;public health relevance;response;screening;tool;treatment response","A Saliva DNA based Epigenetic Test for Adolescent Smoking","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this application is to foster the development of DNA methylation as a tool for the detection of current smoking status and total smoke exposure in adolescents.

"Hematology; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Septicemia; Vaccine Related","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to develop and sustain memory CD8 T cells post-infection or vaccination is a hallmark of the adaptive immune response and the basis for protective vaccination against infectious disease or in cancer immunotherapy. Since the degree of protection to infection depends on the functional characteristics (quality) and number (quantity) of memory CD8 T cells present at the time of antigen (Ag) re-exposure understanding the mechanisms that govern nave-to-memory CD8 T cell differentiation and long-term maintenance of the memory CD8 T cell pool are critical for achieving maximal protection. The outcome of viral or bacterial infections is determined by a series of complex interactions between the pathogen and infected host. Among these interactions the immune status of the host at the time of infection can have a major impact in the host susceptibility to disease. Polymicrobial sepsis represents a leading cause of death in most intensive care units and patients who survive sepsis often display severely compromised immune function with deficits in innate and adaptive immune responses. One hallmark of the general immune suppression observed during polymicrobial sepsis is diminished T cell immunity. Consequently septic patients and sepsis survivors are highly susceptible to new or previously encountered infections that are readily controlled by T cells when a normal functioning immune system is present. In this regard our recent papers revealed that sepsis significantly compromises the host's ability tomount optimal CD8 T cell responses to newly introduced Ag presented in the context of systemic and localized model infections. Our data in these publications also revealed a previously unappreciated role for sepsis in shaping the quantity and functionality of infection- orvaccine-induced pre-existing memory CD8 T cells. However the extent of sepsis-induced changes the nave and memory CD8 T cell pool and mechanisms that control their recovery long-term maintenance and differentiation as well as potential therapeutic interventions to restore number and/or function of nave and memory CD8 T cells in sepsis survivors are currently unknown. Thus our long-term goal is to fully understand the functional consequences imposed on nave and pre-existing memory CD8 T cell populations following sepsis induction. Our central hypothesis is that sepsis-induced apoptosis of Ag-specific nave and/or memory CD8 T cells leads to long-lasting deleterious changes in the composition and/or function of CD8 T cell responses that ultimately result in diminished CD8 T cell responses to newly or previously encountered Ag delivered in the context of localized and systemic infections. We will address our long-term goal with the following specific aims: Aim 1 - Define the regulatory role of dendriti cells in sepsis-induced impairment of CD8 T cell immunity to newly introduced antigens. Aim 2 - Determine the extent to which CD8 T cell intrinsic factors control primary CD8 T cell responses after sepsis. Aim 3 - Determine the impact of sepsis on maintenance and function of pre-existing memory CD8 T cell responses.","Address;Antigens;Apoptosis;Bacterial Infections;CD8B1 gene;Cause of Death;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular Immunity;Characteristics;Communicable Diseases;Complex;Data;Dendritic Cells;Disease;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;IL2 gene;Immune;Immune system;Immunity;Impairment;Individual;Infection;Intensive Care Units;Intrinsic factor;Knowledge;Lead;Maintenance;Memory;Modeling;Natural immunosuppression;Outcome;Paper;Patients;Population;Predisposition;Publications;Recovery;Resolution;Role;Sepsis;Series;Shapes;Survivors;Systemic infection;T cell differentiation;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Vaccination;Vaccines;Virus Diseases;adaptive immunity;base;cancer immunotherapy;immune function;novel strategies;pathogen;septic","Impairment and recovery of CD8 T cell responses after sepsis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Polymicrobial sepsis represents a leading cause of death in most intensive care units and patients who survive severe sepsis often display severely compromised immune function with deficits in innate and adaptive immune responses.

"Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metal exposure has increasingly been recognized as a potential environmental contributor to chronic neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chronic manganese (Mn) exposure has been implicated in Parkinson's-like neurological conditions in humans. Protein aggregation and its prion-like propagation are now considered the central pathophysiological mechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as proteinopathies. However the role of metals in protein aggregation and the neurotoxicological mechanisms that drive degenerative processes are not well understood. -Synuclein (Syn) protein aggregation has been implicated in PD and this protein features multiple divalent metal-binding motifs that have been suggested to play a role in Syn's fibrillization and neurotoxicity. Since Mn shows affinity to the metal binding sites in Syn we have examined the effect of Mn on Syn in neuronal models. Interestingly we found that Syn protected against Mn-induced neurotoxicity during early stages of Mn exposure but prolonged Mn exposure promoted Syn aggregation. In agreement with the emerging concept that aggregated proteins propagate cell-to-cell via exosomal release we also observed enhanced release of exosomes containing Syn into the extracellular environment during Mn exposure. Thus our exciting finding of Mn-induced Syn aggregation and release of exosomes with Syn cargo prompts us to further characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative processes in Mn neurotoxicity. Our proposal will test the novel hypothesis that Mn exposure promotes Syn misfiling and impairs intracellular Syn trafficking thereby increasing the formation and release of exosomes containing Syn protein aggregates which subsequently trigger microglial activation through the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in a PKC-dependent manner. Sustained activation of the PKC-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome pathway contributes to Mn neurotoxicity. Specific objectives of the proposal are: (i) to characterize the cellular mechanism of Mn-induced impairment in endosomal trafficking retromer dysfunction and exosome release in cell culture and animal models of Mn neurotoxicity (ii) to determine NLRP2/3 inflammasome neuroinflammatory signaling in microglia and astrocytes triggered by Mn-induced exosomal Syn aggregates and to characterize the proinflammatory regulatory function of PKC in NLRP2/3 inflammasome activation in Mn neurotoxicity and (iii) to examine the role of PKC in mediating the exosomal Syn aggregate-induced proinflammatory response in animal models of Mn neurotoxicity and to confirm the presence of Syn protein aggregation in Mn-exposed human brain tissues. Our integrated cellular and molecular approach to unraveling the formation and release of exosomal Syn aggregates and their functional consequences on neuroinflammatory signaling in manganese metal neurotoxicity will provide novel mechanistic insights into environmentally-linked neurodegenerative disorders.","Address;Affinity;Agreement;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Animal Model;Astrocytes;Binding;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Chronic;Complex;Disease;Encephalitis;Endosomes;Environment;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Human;Impairment;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-1 beta;Intervention;Knockout Mice;Link;Manganese;Mediating;Metal Binding Site;Metal exposure;Metals;Microglia;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurologic;Neurons;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Play;Process;Proteins;Recycling;Research;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Sorting - Cell Movement;Staging;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Up-Regulation;Vesicle;alpha synuclein;brain tissue;divalent metal;exosome;extracellular;genetic approach;in vivo;insight;nervous system disorder;neuroinflammation;neuron loss;neurotoxicity;novel;prion-like;protein aggregate;protein aggregation;protein complex;response;trafficking","Protein Aggregation and Inflammasome Signaling in Manganese Neurotoxicity","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic metal exposure has been implicated in the pathogenesis of major neurological diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's but pathological mechanisms underlying metal-induced chronic degenerative processes have yet to be characterized.

"Aging; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Services; Rural Health","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives - first to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations and revitalizing the pipeline of well-trained clinical and translational researchers. The task for this new application is extend our impact and to build a model learning health system (LHS) to integrate research and practice across the lifespan and across the T0 - T4 translational spectrum with the intent of accelerating the translation of discovery to improved population health. Becoming an exemplary next generation CTSA that can produce logarithmic acceleration requires refocusing many current programs and creating new resources to: (1) promote workforce development; (2) systematically engage stakeholders; (3) integrate translational research along several distinct dimensions; and (4) spur innovation.    The milestones for this application have a special focus on rural health community engagement research- practice integration clinical research efficiency innovative statistical methods and rare genetic diseases. In addition some of the milestones reflect our interest in working with other CTSA hubs to empirically test different approaches and for developing an evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. In this way we can incentivize the development and adoption of new methods and promote innovation in everyday research processes throughout Iowa and beyond our borders. In particular we will engage investigators and stakeholders across Iowa using approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state and that build on our established community practice networks of family physicians clinics school nurses and pharmacists with particular examples related to lifespan research and child abuse.

"Breast Cancer; Cancer","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adhesion of cells to one another and the extracellular matrix is a fundamental characteristic of all multicellular organisms. Recent work has shown that mechanical force applied to cell adhesion receptors including the cadherins and integrins can affect the activities of Rho family GTPases thereby influencing the organization of the cytoskeleton and the stiffness of cells. This grant is aimed at understanding how signals from cadherins produce the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for cell stiffening with an emphasis on understanding where the cell derives the energy required to support cell stiffening. In our preliminary studies we discovered that application of force to E-cadherin stimulates glucose uptake and increases glucose transporters on the plasma membrane. Using molecular biochemical and cell biological approaches Aim 1 will define the molecular mechanism for how E-cadherin stimulates glucose uptake. Aim 2 will determine how increased glucose uptake facilitates the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for stiffening. Here we aim to identify the RhoA activator and signaling pathways involved. Using magnetic tweezers and beads coated with the extracellular domain of E-cadherin we will determine how force-induced glucose uptake leads to the strengthening of cadherin-mediated adhesions. The final aim will investigate how the force-induced glucose impacts the actin cytoskeleton and its regulation of cell growth and metastasis in vivo. Mouse models of breast cancer will be employed to explore the consequence that promoting E-cadherin mediated force transmission has on disease. When the work in this proposal is complete we expect to establish a new paradigm for how glucose uptake is stimulated by force and facilitates cell stiffening.

"Arthritis; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Fibromyalgia; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Physical Activity","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain associated with fibromyalgia interferes with daily function work and social activities resulting in a decreased quality of life. People with fibromyalgia also have a significant amount fatigue and a fear of movement. People with fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability of pain neurons in the central nervous system and reduced pain inhibition. Therefore one of the main treatments for patients with fibromyalgia must focus on pain relief to allow the person to function more independently both at home and at work. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is used by health professionals to deliver electrical stimulation through the skin for pain control. Basic science studies from the PIs laboratory show that TENS activates descending pain inhibitory pathways to inhibit excitability of pain neurons. Thus the ideal patient population for the treatment of TENS would be one in which there is enhanced central excitability and reduced inhibition; fibromyalgia is such a condition. We hypothesize that application of TENS to patients with fibromyalgia will reduce movement-related pain and reduce central excitability by restoring central inhibition and that this decrease in pain and/or central excitability will reduce fatigue and fear of movement thereby improving function and quality of life. We will test this hypothesis through 4 Specific Aims. Aim 1: test the effectiveness of repeated use of TENS on movement-related pain in people with fibromyalgia with random assignment to three treatments: standard care placebo TENS and active TENS. Aim 2: test if pain reduction by TENS results in a concomitant decrease in fatigue and fear of movement and an increase in function and quality of life. Outcome measures will include physical function by directly assessing daily activity with an accelerometer as well as performing specific functional tasks. Aim 3: determine if active TENS alters pain processing in people with fibromyalgia and if improvement in clinical symptoms correlates with normalization of pain processing physiology. We will evaluate change in these physiologic parameters in responders versus non-responders as assessed clinically. Aim 4: determine if PROMIS is a useful outcome for fibromyalgia by comparing to the revised version of the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ-R).","Accelerometer;Address;Aerobic Exercise;American;Analgesics;Basic Science;Brain Stem;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Degenerative polyarthritis;Effectiveness;Electric Stimulation;Exercise;Exercise intervention;Fatigue;Fibromyalgia;Frequencies;Fright;Health Professional;Home environment;Individual;Laboratories;Malaise;Measures;Midbrain structure;Modality;Movement;Muscle;Musculoskeletal Pain;Neuraxis;Neurons;Nociception;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Pain;Pain Threshold;Pain management;Pathway interactions;Patients;Performance;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Physical Function;Physical activity;Physiological;Physiology;Placebos;Population;Postoperative Pain;Process;Quality of life;Questionnaires;Rest;Rheumatology;Skin;Social Work;Spinal Cord;Symptoms;Syndrome;Testing;Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation;Translating;United States Food and Drug Administration;Walking;Woman;Work;college;daily functioning;diffuse noxious inhibitory control;double-blind placebo controlled trial;efficacy testing;fibromyalgia pain;fitness;improved;improved functioning;innovation;instrument;men;pain inhibition;patient population;public health relevance;responders and non-responders;standard care;trial design","Fibromyalgia Activity Study with TENS ""FAST""","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a double-blind placebo controlled trial designed to test the efficacy of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for the treatment of fibromyalgia pain fatigue function and quality of life.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related; Vector-Borne Diseases; West Nile Virus","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most flaviviruses are transmitted horizontally between vertebrate hosts and hematophagous arthropods; thus these viruses are exposed to fitness constraints imposed by disparate biological systems that preclude specific adaptation to either host. In contrast other recently described flaviviruses such as Culex flavivirus (CxFV) have no known vertebrate host and are considered to be insect-specific. Others such as Modoc virus (MODV) are vertebrate-specific. Viruses in the latter two groups have the potential for host-specific adaptation independent of the need to maintain a compromised fitness level in each host in order to maximize their overall fitness. The evolutionary processes and underlying genetic basis for the differential host ranges and transmission cycles of these viruses have yet to be addressed; however the presence of both dual-host (vertebrate-mosquito) and single-host (mosquito-specific and vertebrate-specific) flaviviruses makes this an optimal system for addressing some of these evolutionary constraints and the resulting genetic determinants that modulate host specificity. Thus the overall goal of this application is to identify the genetic elements that have conditioned the differential host-ranges transmissibility's and tropisms of dual-host and single-host Flaviviruses. Three specific aims have been designed to achieve this goal. In specific aim 1 the genetic elements that modulate the differential host ranges of dual-host and insect-specific flaviviruses will be identified by assessing the in vitro and in vivo vertebrate and mosquito infection phenotypes of chimeric viruses created between WNV and CxFV. In specific aim 2 the genetic determinants that modulate flavivirus host range will be further defined by characterizing the in vitro and in vivo replication phenotypes of viral chimerascreated between a dual-host and vertebrate- specific flavivirus (WNV and MODV respectively). In specific aim 3 two recently discovered ribosomal frameshift proteins - one uniquely encoded by all known insect-specific flaviviruses and the other by WNV and all other Japanese encephalitis serogroup viruses - will be investigated in order to determine their significance in flavivirus host adaptation.","Address;Adoption;Arthropods;Attenuated;Biological Assay;Cells;Chickens;Chimera organism;Code;Complementary DNA;Culex (Genus);Culicidae;Data;Elements;Evolution;Flavivirus;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Determinism;Genome;Goals;Health;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Insecta;Intervention;Invertebrates;Investigation;Japanese Encephalitis;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Maps;Measures;Phenotype;Process;Program Development;Proteins;RNA replication;Ribosomal Frameshifting;Role;Specificity;Structural Genes;System;Testing;Tropism;Vaccination;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Vertebrate Viruses;Vertebrates;Viral;Virus;West Nile virus;attenuation;base;biological systems;design;fitness;genetic element;in vitro Assay;in vivo;insight;invertebrate host;novel;pressure;recombinant virus;tissue tropism;transmission process;vaccine candidate;virus genetics","Identification of genetic determinants that condition flaviviral host specificity","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will lead to the implementation of more efficient vaccination programs by the development of efficacious live-attenuated chimeric vaccines that lack the capacity to replicate in mosquitoes and initiate unwanted transmission cycles and by the identification of novel targets that confer vertebrate-attenuated phenotypes.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Patient Safety","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manual drug compounding of chemotherapy medications permits deadly dosing errors and toxic drug exposure and therefore poses unnecessary risks to patients and healthcare professionals. Some robotic compounding devices have been developed in response; however poor drug containment safety capabilities and prohibitive cost and size have limited widespread adoption of existing compounding devices. Corvida Medical has developed a novel disposable closed system drug transfer device (CSTD) to protect health care workers from toxic exposure to hazardous drugs used in cancer treatments. During Phase II the Corvida R&D team has completed further validation studies to show the Corvida CSTD meets the NIOSH and USP definition of a CSTD and validated our device against ISO standards and most FDA requirements. Corvida has also developed an innovative compounding device that overcomes the safety cost and size limitations of existing compounding devices. At a fraction of the size and cost of current products our technology will ensure reliable accurate compounding to prevent patient medication errors enhancing patient care and will reduce exposure to toxic drugs by interfacing with disposable Corvida CSTD optimizing both worker and patient safety. Phase IIB activities will focus on expanded testing requirements necessary to secure FDA 510(k) clearance of the disposable Corvida CSTD product benchmarking studies against a commercial competitor and on productizing the new compounding device through development of beta prototype that meets preliminary specifications functions with the Corvida CSTD and completing validation testing for process reliability accuracy containment sterility and system throughput. We aim to show a minimum 95% reliability 95% accuracy containment and sterility that meet USP standards and system throughput in line with market expectations. Successful completion of these studies will help catalyze commercialization through clearing regulatory hurdles and by validating our novel compounding device that integrates the advantages of existing technology with the containment capabilities of the Corvida CSTD. Our device is more efficient and cost-effective has a small footprint provides accurate and reliable compounding and minimizes risks to both health professionals and patients. Once commercialized these innovative products will help solve the significant problems of patient and healthcare worker safety though advancements in compounding equipment and disposable CSTDs as well as integration of these technologies into a complete and effective system.","Adoption;Benchmarking;Cancer Center;Cancer Patient;Clinic;Containment;Contracts;Cyclophosphamide;Data;Defect;Detection;Development;Device Designs;Devices;Diagnosis;Disposable Equipment;Dose;Drug Compounding;Drug Exposure;Drug usage;Ensure;Exposure to;Failure;Fluorouracil;Goals;Grant;Head;Health;Health Personnel;Health Professional;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Hospitals;Howard Temin Award;Industry;Infusion procedures;Injection of therapeutic agent;Investments;Joints;Legal patent;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Manuals;Manufacturer Name;Marketing;Medical;Medical Device;Medication Errors;Molds;Outcome;Patient Care;Patients;Performance;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacotherapy;Pharmacy facility;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Practice Guidelines;Preparation;Probability;Process;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Risk;Robotics;Safety;Sampling;Secure;Series;Small Business Innovation Research Grant;Speed;Stainless Steel;Sterility;Surface;Syringes;System;Technology;Testing;Toxicant exposure;Treatment outcome;Ultraviolet Rays;Validation;Vial device;Work;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;commercial application;commercialization;cost;cost effective;design;expectation;experience;improved;innovation;meetings;microbial;novel;operation;patient safety;prevent;prototype;research and development;response;simulation;trypticase-soy broth;usability;validation studies","Innovative Device to Improve Safety of Preparing and Administering Chemotherapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Millions of healthcare workers are at risk of exposure to hazardous drugs such as chemotherapeutics used to treat cancer patients during drug preparation and administration.

It is relevant to public healthbecause it is intended to increase efficiency in diagnosis of animals diseases caused by poisons andcontaminants; for rapid diagnosis of contaminants in drugs used for treatment of food production animals andfor pets; and for improvement of the quality of results derived from analysis of animal tissues environmentalsamples and animal drugs by virtue of strengthening proficiency testing programs. __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__ SPECIFIC AIMSThe melamine food animal poisoning episode of 2007 exposed weaknesses in diagnosis of emergingtoxicants in veterinary diagnostic laboratories. That episode which resulted in the largest pet food recall inthe US history took at least 1 month before a diagnosis of melamine poisoning was confirmed. Although theexact number of dogs and cats that were affected by the melamine food poisoning could not be definitivelydetermined it was estimated to be several thousand sickened and several hundreds dead. At that timemelamine poisoning was an emerging toxicant and its toxic effects in animals were not known. Alsodiagnostic laboratories did not have analytical methods in place to chemically confirm poisoning in affecteddogs. Diagnosis of melamine poisoning relied on a history of ingestion of contaminated pet food clinicalsigns consistent with acute renal failure urinalysis characterized by presence of specific crystals in urineand histopathology consistent with obstructive tubular necrosis. Because Vet-LRN was nonexistent at thetime veterinary diagnostic laboratories worked in isolation to develop assays for melamine cyanuric acidand related contaminants in animal tissues. It is important to note that the melamine poisoning outbreakpreceded the poisoning episode in Chinese children in 2009. Thus melamine poisoning became a ""OneHealth"" issue underscoring the need for veterinary and medical professionals to work collaboratively toimprove human and animal health.Food and drug related animal poisonings are common. Some arise from intentional exposures and othersoccur accidentally. Concerns about terrorism are also real in the world we live in today. In the case ofmelamine poisoning the cause was greed stemming from unscrupulous food ingredient manufacturescheating on the protein content by adding protein look alike industrial compound melamine. But the threat ofagricultural terrorism is also real. There is a distinct possibility that terrorists can maliciously add toxicants tofeeds of food production animals such as cattle pigs and poultry. Toxicants which terrorists would likely useinclude pesticides such as organophosphorous and carbamate insecticides herbicides and rodenticides.Some of these and other compounds may not be registered in the US and so analytical methods to confirmintoxications in animal tissues or drugs may not be readily available. Even for other common toxicants suchas cyanide arsenic and lead for which analytical methods exist the caseload in cases of terrorism may beso huge that surge capacity of the FDA Office of Regulatory Affairs can be exceeded.It makes sense therefore given lessons learned since 2007 that veterinary diagnostic laboratories workthrough the Vet-LRN network to leverage resources and maximize efficiency in tackling and resolving issuesof animal poisoning. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to provide support in three areas: 1)testing of veterinary diagnostic samples in the event of large scale animal illnesses for diagnosticpurposes.

"Clinical Research; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Vector-Borne Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Centered in Des Moines Iowa this project responds to the rapid ethnic and racial diversification occurring in America's heartland and addresses the challenge of the underrepresentation of minorities-both historical and newly arriving-in science. The goal of this project Young Scientists and Ambitious Teachers Improving Health in an Urban Ecosystem is to interrupt the reproduction of educational and health disparities in a low-income urban context and to support historically-excluded youth in their trajectories toward science. To accomplish this we collaborate with community organizations and local schools to support youth as they carry out a community-based participatory inquiry of mosquitoes and health in which they access the Iowa Mosquito Surveillance database the longest-standing mosquito data archive in the country. We use this youth-driven inquiry as a means to prepare educators to teach science in more authentic ambitious and culturally-responsive ways. By concurrently nurturing young scientists along with ambitious teachers this project models a new approach for teacher preparation that is community-embedded. In addition this project is central to Iowa State University's Pathways to College Initiative a uniquely-configured promise program providing access and affordability to higher education for historically-excluded youth. The objectives of the project are three-fold. 1) Historically-excluded youth will develop authentic science knowledge skills and dispositions as well as curiosity interest and positive identification with science and motivation for continued science study by participating in a scientific community and engaging in the activities and discourses of the discipline. 2) Pre-service and in-service teachers will demonstrate competence in authentic and ambitious science teaching and model an affirming orientation toward cultural diversity in science. 3) Residents in the community will display more accurate understandings and transformed practices with respect to mosquitos in the urban ecosystem in service of enhanced health and well-being. The project illustrates a replicable way to address significant educational and health inequities in communities often marginalized from science. It will positively impact the orientations of participating youth and their educators toward science as well as the health and well-being of community residents.      ","Address;American;Americas;Awareness;Communities;Competence;Country;Culicidae;Cultural Diversity;Curiosities;Databases;Discipline;Ecosystem;Education;Educational Curriculum;Educational Materials;Educational Status;Educational process of instructing;Epidemiology;Exclusion;Goals;Health;Human;Iowa;Joints;Knowledge;Learning;Life;Link;Low income;Minority Groups;Modeling;Motivation;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Personal Satisfaction;Play;Prevention;Process;Reproduction;Research;Resources;Risk;Schools;Science;Scientist;Services;Structure;Students;Teacher Professional Development;Translating;Underrepresented Minority;Universities;Youth;base;college;community organizations;community partnership;data archive;ethnic minority population;experience;health disparity;higher education;improved;innovation;inservice teacher;interest;learning engagement;meetings;novel strategies;outreach;programs;public health relevance;public health research;racial and ethnic;racial minority;science teacher;skills;statistics;summer institute;teacher","Young Scientists and Ambitious Teachers Improving Health in an Urban Ecosystem","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project Young Scientists and Ambitious Teachers Improving Health in an Urban Ecosystem aims to interrupt the reproduction of educational and health disparities in a low-income urban context in American's heartland.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in the molecular genetics of deafness have vastly improved our ability to identify heritable hearing losses and have had several important consequences. First the use of genetic testing to diagnose non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) has changed the medical evaluation of the deaf / hard-of-hearing person - after a history physical examination and audiogram genetic testing has become the next test ordered in the care of patients with presumed hereditary hearing impairment. Second the identification of nearly one hundred genes that cause NSHL coupled with technological advances in sequence capture and deep sequencing has made robust epidemiological studies of genetic deafness possible for the first time. Third understanding the genetic basis for normal auditory function is providing insight into inner ear physiology at the molecular level that will lad one day to the development of novel gene-specific and even mutation-specific therapies to treat hearing loss. Over the past granting period we have focused on the following three specific aims: (1) To identify novel genetic causes of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL); (2) To complete mutation screening of the coding sequence of all genes implicated in NSHL; (3) To study the Pendred syndrome / DFNB4 disease spectrum. In this competitive renewal we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To identify genetic mutations in regulatory elements that contribute to NSHL Hypothesis. Mutations in regulatory elements contribute to NSHL. These mutations can be identified by: a) studying a carefully selected patient population that is enriched for non-coding disease-causing variants and for whom full phenotypic and clinical data are available; and b) applying targeted sequence capture and massively parallel sequencing to regulatory regions coupled with integrated analysis of murine ChIP-Seq data ENCODE data and in silico data. Specific Aim 2. To compare simple and complex haplotypes in two well-defined populations - one with age-related hearing loss and one with normal hearing. Hypothesis. Custom modifications of the Galaxy pipeline make it possible to reconstruct unphased haplotypes for all NSHL genes included on OtoSCOPE(R). By studying two well-defined populations one with and the other without age-related hearing loss we will be able to identify at-risk and protective haplotypes and haplotype combinations that are associated with age-related hearing loss. The successful completion of these aims will have a major impact on our understanding of genetic deafness and offer novel insights into how specific protein-protein interactions contribute to age-related hearing loss.","Affect;Audiometry;Auditory;ChIP-seq;Child;Clinical Data;Code;Complex;Computer Simulation;Coupled;Custom;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Data Set;Deafness;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Elderly;Elements;Epidemiologic Studies;Evaluation;Exons;Foundations;Galaxy;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Load;Genetic screening method;Genomics;Grant;Haplotypes;Health;Hearing;Hearing Impaired Persons;Inherited;Labyrinth;Massive Parallel Sequencing;Medical;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Mus;Mutation;Neurologic;Noise-Induced Hearing Loss;Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences;Patient Care;Patients;Pendred Syndrome;Phenotype;Physical Examination;Physiology;Population;Population Control;Presbycusis;Recording of previous events;Regulatory Element;Research;Risk;Role;Target Populations;Testing;Time;United States;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Work;age related;base;clinical practice;deep sequencing;defined contribution;disability;genomic data;hearing impairment;improved;insight;mutation screening;novel;patient population;phenotypic data;promoter;protein protein interaction;standard of care;success;tool","Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss - A Collaborative Study","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This competitive renewal is focused on two questions germane to non-syndromic hearing loss: 1) the identification of non-coding deafness-causing mutations in regulatory elements with a particular focus on promoters; and 2) the evaluation of simple and complex haplotypes as contributing factors to age-related hearing loss (ARHL).

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular targets for vitreoretinopathy and uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery of a calcium-activated protease CAPN5 (calpain-5) as the cause of Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) and that CAPN5 processes PDGFB signaling. CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene and makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach for mechanism-based therapies for inflammation induced by photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptors express CAPN5 and an hCAPN5-R243L gain of function mutation in mice shows all the phenotypes of human ADNIV disease. The retina photoreceptors might be particularly sensitive to mutations in CAPN5 because high intracellular calcium is necessary and sufficient to regulate dark adaptation in photoreceptors. Our long-term goals are to find better and more specific treatments for inflammatory vitreoretinopathy. Our objective is to use in vitro and in vivo cell culture and mouse models to determine the mechanisms responsible for controlling activity of CAPN5. We will also investigate how uncontrolled CAPN5 activity leads to aberrant signaling of one of its substrates platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) and how this signaling results in the subsequent ADNIV phenotypes. Our central hypothesis is that an uncontrolled calcium-activated CAPN5 pathway leads to ADNIV retinal degeneration and uveitis through aberrant PDGFB signaling. By creating a new mouse model we will be able to identify new therapeutic targets. Our specific aims are to (1) Dissect the ADNIV CAPN5 autoproteolysis effect in cells (2) Determine if ADNIV CAPN5 hyperactively cleaves PDGFB to upregulate signaling and (3) Test if PDGFB loss rescues the ADNIV phenotype in a preclinical mouse model. Impact. We expect to gain not only a better understanding of calpain activity and the role PDGFB plays in eye disease but also to identify new therapeutic targets that may be applicable to many eye diseases. Our work should help determine the role of PDGFB signaling in ADNIV and other vitreoretinal degenerative diseases.      ","Age;Automobile Driving;Blindness;Calcium;Calpain;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Cellular Assay;Cleaved cell;Clinical;Dark Adaptation;Degenerative Disorder;Dependence;Diabetic Retinopathy;Disease;Enzymes;Eye diseases;Family Study;Genes;Goals;Human;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inherited;Link;Maps;Medicine;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Target;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mutation;Outcome Study;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Phenocopy;Phenotype;Photoreceptors;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor;Play;Process;Protease Domain;Protein Fragment;Proteins;Proteolysis;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis;Research;Retina;Retinal Degeneration;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Uveitis;Visual;Work;base;disease phenotype;gain of function mutation;gene discovery;genetic approach;in vivo;innovation;insight;kindred;member;mouse model;mutant;neovascular;new therapeutic target;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;photoreceptor degeneration;pre-clinical;public health relevance;receptor;research study;therapeutic target;therapy design","CAPN5-PDGF Signaling in Vitreoretinopathy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ADNIV is an inherited eye disease caused by gain of function mutations in CAPN5 that cause vitreoretinal degeneration and uveitis.

"Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Networking and Information Technology R&D","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interactive Multimedia Consent for Biobanking Abstract Many biobanks in the U.S. consent thousands of contributors of biospecimens and health information. There is growing interest in the efficiency of electronic consenting (e-consent) given the scale of these efforts. However e-consent tools also need to promote diverse users' understanding and trust and demonstrate their effectiveness in comparison to traditional methods such as face-to-face (F2F) consenting. For e-consent to be successful biobanks require well-designed e-consent tools that meet diverse user needs and preferences. Thus empirical research on the design and effectiveness of e-consent is critical for biobank stakeholders to determine whether and how to implement e-consent processes. The long-term objective of this three-year (R01) study is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of informed consent through use of systematically developed e-consent tools. The immediate objective is to develop and test an interactive multimedia (IM) e- consent tool based on theories of cognition and learning resulting in guidelines for biobanks to develop their own e-consent processes. The specific aims of the study are to systematically (1) refine and evaluate a model process for developing IM e-consent tools for biobanking and (2) compare the effectiveness and efficiency of IM to standard F2F consent processes for biobanking. For Aim 1 a prototype IM consent module including a Spanish language version will be developed with iterative feedback from biobank staff IRBs IT experts and prospective users at three genetic biobank operations in the East South and Midwest. Focus groups and interviews will be conducted with stakeholders at each biobank to generate insights into the utility of stakeholder engagement in the module development process. This aim of the study will generate essential guidance for biobanks and other research entities wanting to transition to e-consent. It will also provide threeIM modules with which the study's partner biobanks can begin consenting electronically. In Aim 2 a multisite randomized trial will be conducted with a total of 700 participants at the study's three partnering biobanks including one site with a simplified (2-page) consent document and Spanish-language version. The trial will test the hypotheses that 1) individuals who use the IM multimedia consent tool will have better understanding and confidence in their understanding higher trust in biobank research and higher satisfaction compared to individuals who complete the biobanks' standard F2F consents when controlling for age gender race/ethnicity education computer self-efficacy and income; and 2) staff will spend less time in the IM consent process compared to time spent in the biobanks' standard F2F consents. Significant numbers of traditionally underrepresented minorities will be enrolled in the trial. This aim of the study wll provide empirical evidence for IRBs and the broader genomic research community to decide whether to move forward with electronic IM consenting. Overall the study is expected to contribute to ethical cost-effective consenting efforts through in- depth empirical knowledge of IM e-consent technology.","Adoption;Age;Caucasians;Cognition;Communities;Computers;Consent;Consent Forms;DNA;Data;Development;Education;Effectiveness;Electronics;Empirical Research;Enrollment;Ethics;Ethnic Origin;Feedback;Focus Groups;Gender;Genetic;Genomics;Group Interviews;Guidelines;Health;Healthcare;Income;Individual;Informed Consent;Institution;Institutional Review Boards;Knowledge;Language;Learning;Medical center;Methods;Midwestern United States;Modeling;Multimedia;National Human Genome Research Institute;Participant;Patients;Pilot Projects;Process;Race;Randomized;Reporting;Research;Science;Self Efficacy;Site;Study Section;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissues;Trust;Underrepresented Minority;Universities;Work;abstracting;base;biobank;compare effectiveness;cost effective;design;expectation;improved;insight;interactive multimedia;interest;meetings;next generation;operation;preference;pressure;prospective;prototype;randomized trial;repository;research study;satisfaction;theories;tool","Interactive multimedia consent for biobanking","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Interactive Multimedia Consent for Biobanking Project Narrative Biobanks are considering electronic tools for the obtaining of informed consent.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Digestive Diseases; Health Services; Rare Diseases","    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term career goal is to develop a research agenda around identifying factors that contribute to suboptimal outcomes for cancer patients by developing the ability to combine administrative data with individual-level stakeholder qualitativeand survey data. In order to achieve this objective I need training and experience with qualitative methods and the design and testing of survey instruments. My specific short- term objectives are to (1) acquire the skills to execute patient-centered research through qualitative methods and the design and testing of survey instruments to explain phenomena discovered through analyses of SEER or administrative data (2) gain experience linking Iowa SEER data with complementary data sets and (3) transition to independence through the development of an investigator-initiated (R01) application and leadership skills and relationships necessary to lead the Iowa SEER Cancer Registry. I will achieve my short- term objectives during the proposed 5-year timeline through coursework workshops and scientific meetings and through apprentice-style training to learn from my mentors' research and project leadership activities. My mentorship team includes three highly experienced professors in the University of Iowa College of Public Health who have complementary expertise that supports my career development plan. Dr. Lynch directs the Iowa SEER Cancer Registry and has extensive experience with linkage studies and recruitment of subjects through the Registry. Dr. Chrischilles directs the Population Research Core in the NCI-designated Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center and has experience in developing survey instruments for cancer patients. Dr. Ward directs the Center for Health Policy and Research and leads several projects involving qualitative and mixed-methods approaches to studying rural healthcare delivery. She also teaches a course on primary data collection and mixed-methods. My statistical contributor Dr. Mengeling is a psychometrician with expertise in survey development and evaluation of measurement constructs of survey instruments. My research plan related to rectal cancer treatment will provide opportunities to develop expertise in mixed- methods and data linkages and will also provide pilot data and survey instruments for use in future R01 protocols. Analyses of several large databases have shown that patients who receive treatment from surgeons who perform large numbers of rectal cancer resections experience better rates of survival and sphincter preservation than patients who do not but only a small proportion of patients receive treatment from these highly-experienced surgeons. My research objective is to identify factors that drive patient and referring provider decisions about where to seek and recommend care for rectal cancer respectively and link them to objective data on patient tumor and provider characteristics. This research is innovative because communication and decision-making related to referrals is not well understood and results from this project will provide a multi-stakeholder assessment of perceptions of and expectations for rectal cancer treatment. Results can be used to inform interventions to enhance communication and decision making which could ultimately improve patient outcomes. I plan to accomplish my objective by pursuing the following 3 aims: Aim 1: Identify the common pathways for referrals between time of diagnosis (i.e. colonoscopy) and first visit with the surgeon who ultimately performs the rectal cancer-directed surgery. Determine patient provider and pathway characteristics associated with receipt of surgery from high-volume providers to inform the sampling approach to be used in Aim 2. Aim 2: Evaluate the associations between patient perceptions and decisions on where to seek rectal cancer treatment and between referring-provider considerations and decisions on where to recommend care. Mirroring the process employed by the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) Group (1995) survey instruments will be developed in the following stages: Stage 1: Concept clarification using a panel of experts to define domains. Stage 2: Qualitative pilot using focus groups/interviews with patients and providers to define sub-domains and draft items. Stage 3: Pilot test instruments and assess psychometric statistics. Aim 3: Link survey responses and medical record data with Iowa SEER Registry data Iowa hospital discharge data and physician specialty data to identify more completely the factors and outcomes associated with receiving care from specialized high volume providers. Design an investigator-initiated proposal (R01) to administer instruments to a large nationally representative population of 1) referring providers and 2) rectal cancer patients who can then be followed to assess long-term outcomes associated with decisions on where to receive treatment. Populations across regions can be compared to inform interventions. Expected outcomes include preliminary data and two instruments for use in the R01 project. One instrument will assess patient decision making & outcomes and the other will assess provider decision making. Results of this project and the planned R01 are expected to have a positive impact on rectal cancer outcomes because they will identify patient provider and system-level factors that influence treatment decisions referrl patterns and receipt of guideline recommended care which can then be targeted for intervention.","Affect;Automobile Driving;Belief;Biological Preservation;Cancer Patient;Caring;Characteristics;Clinical;Colon Carcinoma;Colonoscopy;Colorectal Cancer;Communication;Complex;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Data;Data Collection;Data Linkages;Data Set;Databases;Decision Making;Development;Development Plans;Diagnosis;Disease;Educational process of instructing;Educational workshop;Elderly;Evaluation;Excision;Faculty;Focus Groups;Funding;Future;Genitourinary system;Goals;Group Interviews;Guidelines;Health;Health Policy;Hospitals;Incidence;Individual;Intervention;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Leadership;Learning;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Medical Records;Mentors;Mentorship;Methods;Minority;Morbidity - disease rate;NCI-Designated Cancer Center;Neoadjuvant Therapy;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pattern;Pelvis;Perception;Physicians;Policy Research;Population;Population Research;Process;Protocols documentation;Provider;Psychometrics;Public Health;Published Comment;Qualitative Methods;Quality of life;Recommendation;Rectal Cancer;Registries;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Risk Factors;Rural;Sampling;Sphincter;Staging;Surgeon;Surveys;Survival Rate;System;Testing;Time;TimeLine;Training;Treatment outcome;Universities;Variant;Visit;World Health Organization;anticancer research;apprenticeship;base;burden of illness;cancer therapy;career;career development;chemoradiation;college;data registry;design;expectation;experience;health care delivery;improved;innovation;instrument;malignant breast neoplasm;medical specialties;meetings;member;neoplasm registry;patient oriented;professor;response;screening;skills;sound;statistics;tumor;ward","Adding patient and provider viewpoints to rectal cancer practice variation data","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been shown that a only a small proportion of patients with rectal cancer receive treatment from highly-experienced surgeons despite the evidence indicating better survival and sphincter preservation rates are achieved by these experienced surgeons.

"Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Services; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rural Health; Stroke","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of lowa (Ul) Statewide Stroke Research Network meets the goal of the NINDS Stroke Trials Network of maximizing efficiencies in developing promoting and conducting high quality multi-site clinical trials on stroke prevention treatment and recovery. The current proposal builds on the rich tradition of the Ul as a leader in both developing and conducting NINDS-sponsored research as well as on the Ul's role as the hub of a new integrated health care network - The Ul Health Alliance. The long-term goals of this proposal are to improve the efficiency of conducting Phase I - III stroke trials and to ensure a robust pipeline of well-trained clinical investigators to lead such trials. he proposal's immediate goal is to establish an expanded statewide research network for conducting stroke trials that reaches underserved rural patients who currently are unable to participate in stroke trials due to geographical barriers and who are subject to disparities in health outcomes. The proposed University of lowa Regional Coordinating Center (UIRCC) represents a comprehensive and integrated infrastructure for conducting trials that brings together healthcare providers hospital administrators clinical and health service investigators public health officials and patient advocates. The UIRCC comprises a network that expands the research capabilities of the Ul to 12 trial-ready sites. Those hospitals will be supplied by a statewide infrastructure of spokes that will allow adequate representation in trials of those Americans first evaluated at critical access hospitals. The UIRCC will capitalize on prior work by the PI to improve recruitment of patients presenting to critical access hospitals and maximize geographic access of patients. The feasibility of this approach is supported by the ongoing research data sharing collaboration and a strong institutional support from the statewide healthcare alliance.

"Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Stroke","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammation appears to play a critical role in the formation of cerebral aneurysms their progression to rupture- prone type and ultimately to rupture. Evidence supporting this hypothesis includes recent data from human neurosurgery patients and experimental animal models demonstrating that aneurysm wall tissue is rich with macrophages and inflammatory molecules. To investigate potential therapeutic implications of this hypothesis I carried out a retrospective study examining whether patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms who took aspirin had a reduced risk of aneurysm rupture. This study was performed using the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms data base. Patients who used aspirin three times weekly to daily have a significantly decreased risk of aneurysm rupture. My current scientific goals and the subject of this proposal are to study the molecular mechanisms by which inflammation influences cerebral aneurysm formation and rupture. I am using the well-established Hashimoto mouse aneurysm model to pursue two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1 I will determine the contributions of COX-1 and COX-2 to the protective effect of aspirin against aneurysm rupture. In Specific Aim 2 I will determine the celltype associated with activation of the COX-2 pathway resulting in a protective effect against aneurysm rupture. These studies will involve the use of complementary genetic pharmacological and bone marrow transplantation experimental approaches. Knowledge of the inflammation related molecular mechanisms of aneurysm formation and rupture will provide information that is critical to the development of effective new medical therapies for patients wit this dangerous cerebrovascular disease.","Aneurysm;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Aspirin;Attenuated;Blood Platelets;Bone Marrow Cells;Bone Marrow Transplantation;California;Cells;Cerebral Aneurysm;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Chronic;Clinical Research;Databases;Development;Devices;Dinoprostone;Drug effect disorder;Enrollment;Experimental Animal Model;Functional disorder;Genetic;Goals;Health;Heart;Hematopoietic;Histologic;Human;Implant;Incidence;Inflammation;Inflammatory;International;Intervention;Intracranial Aneurysm;Investigation;Iowa;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Laboratories;Learning;Mediating;Medical;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Neurosurgeon;PTGS2 gene;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Process;Research;Retrospective Studies;Risk;Role;Rupture;Ruptured Aneurysm;San Francisco;Scientist;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Training;Transplantation;Universities;WFDC2 gene;Wild Type Mouse;Wit;Work;career development;cell type;cyclooxygenase 1;histological studies;human data;inhibitor/antagonist;macrophage;molecular targeted therapies;mouse PGE synthase 1;neurosurgery;prevent;protective effect;research study;stroke;treatment strategy","Mechanisms of Effect of Aspirin on Cerebral Aneurysms in Mice","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary goal of the proposed project is to delineate molecular mechanisms of the protective effect of aspirin in reducing the incidence of cerebral aneurysm rupture using an experimental animal model.","NINDS","9122497","8/5/2016","PA-11-193","4K08NS082363-04","4","K08","NS","082363","04","","KOENIG, JAMES I","9/30/2013","8/31/2018","NST-1 Study Section[NST-1]"," ","10603316","HASAN, DAVID M.","Not Applicable","01","NEUROSURGERY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2016","8/31/2017"," ","853","Other Research-Related","2016","167886"," ","NINDS","155450","12436"," ","167886",
"Biotechnology; Cancer; Genetics; Hematology; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Uterine Cancer","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular resistance is one of the major causes of therapeutic failure for solid tumors thus highlighting the need to identify novel factors driving aggressive phenotypes. Overexpression of metadherin (MTDH also known as AEG-1 and LYRIC) has been documented in numerous solid tumors to date and correlates with poor prognosis. Moreover MTDH overexpression has been implicated in metastasis and resistance to therapy two important hallmarks of an aggressive cancer. We recently made the important discovery that MTDH acts as an RNA binding protein to alter translation of multiple mRNAs thus identifying a potential role for MTDH in post- translational gene expression. These mRNAs include several DNA repair proteins in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. Our objective in this application is to determine the role of MTDH regulation of DNA repair in resistance to therapy. The rationale for this project is that because MTDH is highly expressed in multiple cancer types and contributes to the emergence of a resistant phenotype mechanistic insights into how MTDH functions will offer a strong scientific framework whereby MTDH pathway targeted therapies can be developed. To test our central hypothesis we propose three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will identify mechanisms by which MTDH association with specific mRNAs alters the DNA damage response pathway. Using MTDH-deficient cancer cell lines and MTDH-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts we will study the role of MTDH in mRNA metabolism and control of translation of Rad18 FANCI FANCD2 and other DNA repair proteins. We will extend studies to determine if MTDH knockdown or disruption the MTDH:mRNA complex by mRNA mimetics are sufficient to perturb MTDH translational regulation of FA pathway genes. In Aim 2 we will overcome resistance to cisplatin by targeting MTDH and the DNA repair pathway. We will evaluate whether targeting MTDH and the FA DNA repair pathway can increase the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin via disruption of the cellular response to DNA damage. In Aim 3 we will determine the effect of MTDH expression and FA pathway activation on resistance to ICL-inducing agents in cancer. Studies will include 1) xenograft experiments using well-characterized human endometrial tumors from our viable tumor bank; and 2) immunohistochemical analysis of the MTDH and FA pathway in FFPE tumor tissues from 86 advanced endometrial cancer patients treated with ICL-inducing agents. Upon the successful completion of the proposed research it is our expectation that we will understand the pathological function of MTDH through its regulation of mRNA stability and translation of FA pathway proteins. These results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will provide a strong mechanistic basis for the correlation of MTDH overexpression with therapeutic resistance and serve as a foundation for the future development of MTDH-targeted therapies.","Address;Aftercare;Automobile Driving;Binding;Biomedical Research;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cancer Biology;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Carboplatin;Cell Death;Cells;Chromosomes Human Pair 8;Cisplatin;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Complex;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;DNA Repair Gene;DNA Repair Pathway;Data;Development;Drug resistance;Embryo;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrial Neoplasms;Failure;Family;Fanconi Anemia pathway;Fanconi&apos;s Anemia;Fibroblasts;Foundations;Future;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Translation;Goals;Grant;Gynecologic;Human;Knock-out;Lead;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Metabolism;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenes;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Proteins;Publications;RNA-Binding Proteins;Recurrent disease;Regimen;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Role;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translational Regulation;Translations;Treatment Efficacy;Tumor Bank;Tumor Tissue;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;base;cancer risk;cancer therapy;cancer type;chemotherapeutic agent;chemotherapy;expectation;insight;knock-down;mRNA Stability;member;mimetics;novel;outcome forecast;overexpression;prevent;public health relevance;repaired;research study;response;success;targeted treatment;therapy resistant;tumor","MTDH regulates Fanconi anemia repair pathway to mediate drug resistance","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MTDH is an oncogene involved in both metastasis and drug resistance the most deadly aspects of cancer and drivers of therapeutic failure.

"Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Urologic Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The etiology and natural history of urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS) are not well understood. Along with other MAPP Research Network sites the University of Iowa will perform a longitudinal phenotyping study of UCPPS symptom patterns. Within this Trans-MAPP study we will characterize the role of neuroinflammation and hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) dysregulation in UCPPS symptoms and symptom change. The central hypothesis of this work is that toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 activation and (HPA) dysregulation are key underlying features of UCPPS and will be associated with UCPPS symptom changes flares and disease progression. To test this hypothesis men and women with UCPPS will be enrolled into the 36-month Symptom Patterns Study in which symptoms symptom change and flare frequency and severity will be characterized (Aim 1). In-person and internet-based questionnaires will be collected every 3 months. Complementary Trans-MAPP research will determine the role of inflammatory biomarkers and stress pathways with respect to urological and non-urological longitudinal symptom patterns and flares (Aim 2); develop test and use a mobile application to provide real-time ecological momentary assessments of pain and associated symptoms (Aim 3); perform brain magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether acute stress- evoked pain modulates brain networks and if changes in functional connectivity are predictive of long-term pain symptom change (Aim 4); and use preclinical UCPPS mouse models to determine whether TLR-2/TLR-4 sensitization is mechanistically linked to pain and voiding dysfunction (Aim 5). The work proposed will provide an integrated assessment of disease biomarkers genetic predictors real-time symptom measurement and brain structure/function in men and women with UCPPS and their associations with UCPPS symptom changes over time. In the animal model we will explore potential translational therapeutic approaches based on TLR-4 modulation. These Trans-MAPP study results will not only identify neuroinflammatory phenotypes related to symptom improvement worsening and flares but will also reveal mechanisms by which targeted UCPPS therapy may eventually be implemented.","Animal Model;Biological Markers;Brain;Cellular Phone;Characteristics;Chronic Prostatitis;Clinical;Data;Disease;Disease Progression;Ecological momentary assessment;Endocrine system;Enrollment;Etiology;Flare;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Genetic Polymorphism;Goals;Health;Hormonal;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Internet;Interstitial Cystitis;Iowa;Lead;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurable;Measurement;Methods;Modeling;Natural History;Pain;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pelvic Pain;Peripheral;Persons;Phenotype;Questionnaires;Receptor Activation;Research;Risk Factors;Role;Severities;Site;Stress;Structure;Symptoms;Syndrome;TLR2 gene;TLR4 gene;Technology Assessment;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Toll-like receptors;Translational Research;Universities;Urology;Woman;Work;acute stress;associated symptom;base;brain pathway;chronic pelvic pain;clinically relevant;cohort;expectation;genetic predictors;hypothalamic pituitary axis;ineffective therapies;innovation;insight;interdisciplinary approach;men;mobile application;mobile computing;mouse model;neuroinflammation;pain symptom;pre-clinical;research study;symptomatic improvement;symptomatology;targeted treatment;urinary;urologic","Urology Chronic Pelvic Pain Longitudinal Symptom Patterns Study","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this project will help us better understand how pain and urinary symptoms of Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS) change over time and define how inflammation and hormonal systems in the body may impact or predict UCPPS symptom changes.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Genetics; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an Assistant Professor (tenure track) with primary clinical interest in Endocrine Surgical Oncology and training in basic science research. She is very committed to a long-term career goal of establishing herself as an independent investigator in the area of thyroid cancer research. She has been working in a very collaborative and synergistic environment with substantial institutional commitment to her academic success. She is applying for this award with the intent of eventually being able to apply for an NIH R01 grant and establish her own research program. Her career development plan for this award mechanism includes formal course work and attendance at seminars and conferences pertinent to her field of research with a goal to increase both didactic and practical knowledge in the mechanisms of gene regulation in cancers. In addition she will interact closely with her mentors and Research Review Committee to ensure that she progresses to independence. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy affecting the endocrine glands and its incidence rates have been rising over the past 30 years. It is not a uniformly fatal malignancy. However recurrent disease (occurring in 25% of patients) has been reported to increase subsequent mortality even from well- differentiated thyroid cancers. Well-differentiated tumors are typically treated with surgery and radio-active iodine ablation. However recurrences are often less responsive to radioactive iodine and it is not possible to reliably predict which tumors will recur or metastasize. In addition some types of thyroid cancer such as anaplastic tumors are very aggressive and currently have no effective therapy. Preliminary studies suggest that Extracellular Matrix 1 (ECM1) is over-expressed in anaplastic thyroid cancers and that its expression may be a prognostic indicator in differentiated thyroid malignancies. Additional preliminary studies using cell line models indicate that TFAP2C likely regulates ECM1 expression. The hypothesis underlying the proposed work is that ECM1 is an important prognostic marker in thyroid cancer that confers increased metastatic potential and that its expression is regulated by TFAP2. This application proposes to expand our understanding of the regulation of ECM1 overexpression and its role in prognosis with the following specific aims. 1) Determine the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of ECM1 with particular reference to TFAP2C; 2) Examine the role of ECM1 over-expression and silencing on invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells and 3) Examine the role of ECM1 expression as a determinant of outcome in patients with thyroid cancer and determine whether it is co-expressed with TFAP2C. Luciferase assays will be used to define the promoter region of ECM1 and chromatin immunoprecipitation will be used to determine if TFAP2C binds this region. The effects of ECM1 overexpression will be evaluated using in vitro invasion and migration assays and in vivo in an orthotopic mouse model. Lastly ECM1 expression will be examined by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in a hospital-based cohort of patients with thyroid cancer to determine whether it correlates with clinical outcomes. The significance and health-relatedness of this research endeavor is that it will increase our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of the aggressive and poor-prognosis phenotype of thyroid cancer. This will hopefully lead to new insights regarding their development and enhance our ability to discover novel and directed therapies for these and other poor-risk tumors.","1q21;Ablation;Accounting;Affect;Aggressive behavior;Area;Award;Basic Science;Binding;Biological Assay;Breast Epithelial Cells;Cancer Patient;Cancer Prognosis;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Characteristics;Chromosome Mapping;Classification;Clinical;Complication;Development;Development Plans;Diagnosis;Disease;Endocrine;Endocrine Glands;Ensure;Environment;External Beam Radiation Therapy;Extracellular Matrix;Gene Expression Regulation;Goals;Grant;Health;Hospitals;Human;Immunohistochemistry;In Vitro;Incidence;Iodine;Knowledge;Lead;Luciferases;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of thyroid;Mammary Neoplasms;Mentors;Migration Assay;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Neoplasm Metastasis;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Patients;Phenotype;Prognostic Marker;Promoter Regions;Proteins;Radioactive Iodine;Radiosurgery;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Regulation;Repeat Surgery;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Review Committee;Risk;Role;Surgical Oncology;System;TFAP2A gene;TFAP2C gene;Thyroid Gland;Time;Training;Transcriptional Regulation;Tumor Cell Migration;Undifferentiated;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;anaplastic thyroid cancer;angiogenesis;anticancer research;base;carcinogenesis;career;career development;chemotherapy;chromatin immunoprecipitation;cohort;conventional therapy;diagnostic biomarker;differential expression;effective therapy;genome wide association study;high risk;in vivo;insight;interest;migration;mortality;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;outcome forecast;overexpression;professor;programs;promoter;success;symposium;tenure track;therapeutic target;therapy development;thyroid neoplasm;transcription factor;trend;tumor;tumor progression;young woman","Regulation of Extracellular Matrix 1(ECM1) and its role in thyroid carcinogenesis","Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy affecting the endocrine glands and thyroid cancer incidence rates have been rising over the last 30 years.

Using F1-V as the immunogen we have demonstrated its ability to induce in a single administration long-lived protective immunity in mice for up to 40 weeks against a lethal infection with Yersinia pestis the causative agent of pneumonic plague. We propose to combine this nanovaccine platform with cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-based innate immune inducers to design vaccines against multiple biodefense pathogens (i.e. Y. pestis and Bacillus anthracis) thereby breaking the ""one-bug one-drug"" paradigm. Currently available vaccine formulations and adjuvants lack long-term stability do not promote induction of antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity and/or are reactogenic. Our combination nanovaccine platform will overcome all these shortcomings will be broadly applicable to infectious diseases and will have application against non- defense respiratory pathogens as well. Furthermore the nanovaccine is heat stable thereby obviating the cold chain. Our central hypothesis based on significant peer-reviewed preliminary data on the tunability and efficacy of our adjuvant platforms is that polyanhydride nanovaccines together with CDNs can be used to formulate efficacious single-dose vaccines against multiple biodefense pathogens. We will position this platform for preclinical studies that will advance the development of vaccine technologies specific for NIAID Category A priority agents by accomplishing the following Specific Aims each of which is bounded by milestones go/no-go decisions and fall-back positions: Aim 1. Optimize the immunization regimen of combination nanovaccine formulations to provide protection against lethal challenge with two biodefense agents. Aim 2. Evaluate the protective capabilities of the lead combination nanovaccine formulation from Aim 1 against lethal challenge with B. anthracis in rabbits and Y. pestis in non-human primates. Aim 3. Demonstrate enhanced storage shelf life performance of optimized lead combination nanovaccine formulation identified in Aims 1 and 2.  Partners include: Iowa State University who will refine the immunogenic dose and combination nanovaccine formulations demonstrate the efficacy and protective capabilities of the vaccines in mice and perform the storage shelf life studies; Aduro BioTech who will prepare innate immune stimulators and evaluate interactions of combination nanovaccine formulations with human cells; and Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute who will determine the efficacy of the lead combination nanovaccine in rabbits and NHPs.  At the end of the project period we will deliver a single-dose combination nanovaccine formulation capable of safely inducing protective immunity against two biodefense pathogens that is ready for preclinical studies.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reducing obesity through improved nutrition and increased physical activity is one of the goals of the CDC's Winnable Battles initiative. Reducing obesity in rural residents is especially important since they are more likely to be obese than urban residents. Indeed Iowa residents rank 33rd of 50 states in the percent of residents who are obese and half of Iowa's adults do not meet PA recommendations. Effective interventions to increase PA in rural micropolitan (<50000 residents) communities are scant since most evidence-based interventions have been tested in urban or suburban areas. In the Midwest these micropolitan communities are also ""new destination"" locations for an influx of Latino populations. The Prevention Research Center for Rural Health (PRC-RH) with a focus on obesity addresses the health challenges of residents of micropolitan and other rural communities in Iowa through a variety of Center activities and resources as well as the implementation of an intervention research project ActiveOttumwa. PRC-RH Center activities include maintenance of an infrastructure with cores focusing on community engagement communication and dissemination of PRC-RH research and best practices training of public health professionals students and community members and evaluation of PRC-RH activities. The PRC-RH has vibrant partnerships with the Iowa Department of Public Health an active Community Advisory Board with local health department and community organization representation in Ottumwa Iowa a micropolitan new destination community. The PRC-RH intervention research project Active Ottumwa focuses on increasing physical activity in Ottumwa by determining the effectiveness of a community-based PA intervention that uses a lay health advisor (LHA) approach - to implement evidence-based PA strategies. Based on the available evidence and strategies from the Community Guide the Active Ottumwa will implement activities at three levels of influence: 1) community-wide campaigns (e.g. newspaper TV and radio announcements website exposure and public health education programs; 2) behavioral and social support interventions (e.g. behavioral contracts buddy systems goal-setting to promote and support PA activities; and 3) land-use policies and access to places for PA (.e.g. working with local governmental officials and agencies and community leaders to advocate improve and create opportunities for access and use of facilities for PA). To evaluate Active Ottumwa mixed methods will be used including a community-wide survey; longitudinal follow up of a cohort of residents that will complete accelerometry physical and anthropometric measures and survey data; observational measures; key informant in-depth interviews; and project documentation. The research project and PRC-RH will address a major evidence gap in our PA knowledge by adapting intervention strategies tested in urban and suburban areas to a micropolitan new destination community in a rural state.         "," ","University of Iowa Prevention Research Center for Rural Health","Project NarrativeThe Center activities and its research focus on the issue of obesity in rural populations.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Muscular Dystrophy surveillance tracking and Research Network (MD STARnet) was established in 2002 to conduct population-based surveillance and long-term follow-up of individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DBMD). Longitudinal surveillance for DBMD has been ongoing since 2004. Active follow-up commenced in 2007 by administering telephone interviews to primary caregivers of DBMD cases to determine medical interventions and influence of family characteristics geography insurance status and social support on clinical outcomes. Additional follow-up administered included mailed surveys to adult DBMD cases and their caregivers to examine needs and quality of life for these individuals and most recently to describe transitions from pediatric to adult clinical care and other life experiences for late-adolescent and adult DBMD cases. In 2012 the MD STARnet was expanded to include cross-sectional surveillance for seven additional MDs (congenital distal Emery-Dreifuss facioscapulohumeral limb-girdle myotonic and oculopharyngeal). Our Iowa Site was one of four charter awardees for the MD STARnet in 2002 and was successfully refunded in 2006 and 2011. The Iowa Site has also served as the national MD STARnet Data Coordinating Center (DCC) since it was established in 2003. As the DCC we successfully created and implemented an infrastructure that provided informatics expertise and support for all population-based DBMD longitudinal surveillance and research activities and for population-based cross-sectional surveillance for the additional MDs. We propose to continue as the DCC to provide expert informatics support for surveillance and research of MDs and selected neuromuscular diseases (NMDs).

"Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Dietary Supplements; Nutrition","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Natural products have a proven record of providing a significant fraction either directly or as lead compounds of human medicines. Among these the terpenoids (isoprenoids) stand out as being the largest class (>50000 already known) with the diterpenoids targeted here making up a significant fraction (>11000 known). Indeed the extensive diversification of diterpenoids indicates that these natural products provide a rich source of biological activity with a number of these being used as pharmaceuticals (e.g. TaxolTM and the tanshinones) and/or research tools (e.g. phorbol esters). In addition some LRDs serve important physiological roles in the native producing organisms - e.g. in plant defense against microbial diseases. Accordingly we propose here to continue our productive investigation of the biosynthetic enzymes required to produce bioactive diterpenoids. Specifically we will build on our previous work in this area which includes elucidation of novel diterpenoid metabolic networks. This proposal then advances our long-term goal of engineering enzymes and metabolic pathways for the production of targeted libraries and specific individual terpenoid 'natural' products to benefit human health. In particular the objective of this proposalis investigation of novel diterpenoid metabolism in a variety of plants including the important crop plant rice as well as medicinal herbs.

These models will provide insights into thebasic cell biology of the disease and facilitate the development of effective treatments including gene therapy.This proposed project will focus on evaluating two gene therapy approaches in the CF ferret model and onelucidating key aspects of airway cell biology that will direct choices of the gene therapy approaches used. CFferrets have two lung infection phenotypes that will be useful in developing therapies for CFrapid lethalneonatal infections during the first 1-3 weeks of life; and slower chronic bacterial infections thereafter typicallyleading to death by 3-5 months of life. We will use these robust lung phenotypes to develop lentivirus- andrecombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-based gene therapies for CF lung disease. The preliminary datapresented and vectors chosen for study in this project are the product of the first two years of an R01 awardthat will transition into this PPG. Important goals of this project include: 1) the development and analysis ofmiRNA detargeting approaches to regulate cellular expression patterns of a lentiviral CFTR transgene and limitthe phenotypic consequences of ectopic CFTR expression in multi-potent airway progenitor cells 2) thegeneration of rAAV-CFTR vectors that are capable of reversing lung disease in the CF ferret model and thatare also compatible with both the packaging limitations of the rAAV genome and cellular expression patternsrequired for efficient complementation of CFTR function and 3) identification of the cell types in the lung thatmust be targeted for effective complementation of CF lung disease. The third goal of the proposal draws on theunique ability of the Engelhardt laboratory to rapidly generate transgenic ferrets that express recombinantfCFTR in biologically relevant cell types within the lung. Thus this proposal uses novel viral targeting methodsto address cellular mechanisms relevant to improving gene therapies to the airway while also tackling difficultcell biology questions about the pathogenesis and treatment of CF lung disease using gene therapy. Thisresearch is expected to significantly enhance the field's ability to develop effective therapies for CF lungdisease.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Animal Model;Animals;Area;Award;Bacterial Infections;Basal Cell;Biology;Caucasians;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Chronic;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disadvantaged;Disease;Disease Vectors;Ectopic Expression;Effectiveness;Enhancers;Epithelial;Equine Infectious Anemia Virus;Family suidae;Feline Leukemia Virus;Ferrets;Gene Transduction Agent;Gene Transfer;Gene Transfer Techniques;Generations;Genes;Genome;Gland;Goals;Human;In Vitro;Infection;Laboratories;Lactoferrin;Lentivirus Vector;Libraries;Life;Lung;Lung diseases;Maps;Mediating;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Natural Immunity;Natural regeneration;Neonatal;Newborn Infant;Pathogenesis;Patients;Pattern;Phenotype;Process;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV);Recombinants;Regulation;Research;Serous;Staging;Stem cells;Subfamily lentivirinae;Surface;System;Techniques;Testing;Transcript;Transgenes;Transgenic Organisms;Untranslated Regions;Viral;Viral Genome;Viral Vector;Work;Xenograft procedure;airway epithelium;base;cell type;clinical care;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis airway epithelia;effective therapy;gene complementation;gene therapy;improved;in vitro testing;in vivo;insight;meetings;novel;novel strategies;prevent;progenitor;promoter;protein expression;reconstitution;research study;self-renewal;somatic cell nuclear transfer;therapy development;transgene expression;vector","Gene Therapy for Lung Disease in a Ferret Model of Cystic Fibrosis","Project Narrative (Project 3)Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening autosomal-recessive condition among Caucasianswith clinical care for patients in the U.S. alone totaling over $450 million annually.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Lung disease continues to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Genetransfer offers the potential to express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inthe lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and thereby prevent or treat lung disease. But we lack answersto many questions that are crucial for developing gene transfer. A major impediment to progress has beenlack of animal models with disease that mimics human CF. To overcome this roadblock we developed aporcine model of CF that spontaneously develops lung disease. We discovered that loss of CFTR impairsthe activity of antimicrobials in airway surface liquid (ASL) and hinders mucociliary transport (MCT). In bothcases loss of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate secretion and an abnormally acidic pH are key factors. We alsodeveloped novel assays of these host defense mechanisms for both in vitro and in vivo experiments. We willuse this novel model and assays to answer questions that are key for advancing CF treatments. First Howdoes CFTR expression level and the fraction of cells expressing CFTR affect airway epithelial ion transportand host defense processes? Answering this question will for the first time provide key data aboutrelationships between specific CFTR functions and host defense. Second will CFTR expression correct hostdefense defects and prevent and/or treat CF lung disease in vivo? We will develop CF pigs with inducibleexpression of CFTR in epithelia and test the hypotheses a) that expressing CFTR in airways rescues hostdefense processes b) that CFTR expression beginning shortly after birth prevents airway infectioninflammation and remodeling c) that expressing less than wild-type levels of CFTR in airway epithelia issufficient to prevent lung disease and d) that CFTR expression after disease onset treats or reverses airwaydisease.

ABSTRACT (PROJECT 1)Gene transfer is a potential strategy to treat CF airways disease yet we still lack answers to importantquestions to any gene transfer approach. What percentage of CF airway epithelial cells must be targeted andat what expression level is needed to correct relevant ion transport defects? What are the key CF hostdefense defects? Can we rescue those defects? Will targeting airway surface epithelia in vivo rescue hostdefense? Clinical CF lung disease? Our program made advances in three areas that allow us to answer thesequestions. First we developed a model of CF in pigs. Within months of birth they develop features of CF lungdisease. Second we discovered that loss of CFTR impairs two key respiratory host defense mechanismsmucociliary transport (MCT) and antibacterial activity in airway surface liquid (ASL). Impaired CFTR-mediatedHCO3- secretion that results in abnormally acidic ASL causes both of these defects. Third we developed viralvectors: AAV evolved to infect airway epithelia and GP64-pseudotyped FIV that can deliver CFTR cDNA toairway epithelia. Our preliminary data indicate that these vectors generate airway epithelial HCO3- secretionand correct the acidic ASL pH. Now is the time to answer questions that have nagged the field since we firstbegan thinking about gene therapy. Here we propose three specific aims that will inform strategies for CF genetransfer. Aim 1. What factors determine whether gene transfer to pig and human CF airway epithelia in vitrorescues anion secretion and host defense properties? We will investigate the relationships betweentransduction and expression data (the % of cells expressing CFTR the level of CFTR expression) and thephysiological consequences. Aim 2. Will CFTR gene transfer to CF airway surface epithelia correct ASL pHbacterial killing and MCT defects in vivo? Aim 3. Will gene transfer to airway surface epithelia prevent theairway inflammation infection and remodeling associated with early CF lung disease? These data may helpus understand the relative importance of the CF host defense defects will suggest whether targeting surfaceepithelia has clinical benefit and will guide future gene transfer approaches.","Age;Anions;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Area;Benchmarking;Bicarbonates;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Birth;Cell surface;Cells;Clinical;Complementary DNA;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Disease;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Equilibrium;Exhibits;Family suidae;Feline Immunodeficiency Virus;Ferrets;Future;Gene Transfer;Genes;Gland;Host Defense;Host Defense Mechanism;Human;In Vitro;Infection;Inflammation;Ion Transport;Killings;Knowledge;Lentivirus Vector;Lung;Lung diseases;Measures;Mediating;Modeling;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Physiological;Property;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Scientist;Series;Structure of respiratory epithelium;Surface;System;Testing;Thinking;Time;Transgenic Model;Viral Vector;Viscosity;adeno-associated viral vector;airway epithelium;airway inflammation;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;cell type;cellular transduction;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis airway epithelia;design;early cystic fibrosis;gene therapy;improved;in vivo;insight;novel;prevent;programs;promoter;research study;respiratory;therapeutic development;vector","Gene Transfer to Porcine Respiratory Epithelia with Viral Vectors","1.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Digestive Diseases; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","CORE A  ANIMAL MODELSPROJECT SUMMARYCystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding thecystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects multiple organs including lungspancreas intestine liver sweat glands gallbladder and the male genital tract. Airway infection andinflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality. Although several therapies have improvedthe lives of patients current treatments are inadequate and CF remains a lethal disease. Our knowledgeabout the pathogenesis of the disease its progression and the state of the neonatal lung is inadequate.These gaps in our knowledge have hindered attempts to develop better treatments and preventions for CFlung disease. A major impediment to addressing these issues has been limitations of current animal models.Although mouse strains carrying null and missense CFTR mutations have made enormous contributions CFmice do not develop the airway or pancreatic disease typically found in humans. We recently generated CFferrets and pigs that replicate many of the key features of human CF disease including intestinal obstructionexocrine pancreatic destruction micro-gallbladder vas deferens abnormalities focal biliary cirrhosiscongenital airway structural abnormalities and airway and sinus infection with time. The goals of the AnimalModels Core will be to (1): Provide Program investigators with non-CF and CF ferrets and pigs and to buildnew genetically engineered CF ferret and pig models that express CFTR in a regulated fashion; (2) Assistprojects in carrying out vector delivery the harvesting of biologic samples from live animals (e.g.bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood) and the care and analysis of study animals; (3) Facilitate studies bymonitoring disease progression with high resolution computed tomography sinus and lung imaging andmeasuring mucociliary transport. The Animal Models Core will function seamlessly through alreadyestablished interactions with the Project Leaders Pathology Core In Vitro Models and Cell Culture Core VectorCore and the Administrative Core. The success of the Animal Models Core is ensured because of thecommitment experience and expertise that the personnel bring to the Core.","Address;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Biliary cirrhosis;Blood;Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid;Caring;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Chronic;Consultations;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Disease;Disease Progression;Ensure;Exocrine pancreas;Failure;Family suidae;Ferrets;Gallbladder;Genes;Genetic Engineering;Goals;Harvest;Health;Hereditary Disease;High Resolution Computed Tomography;Human;Human Resources;Infection;Inflammation;Intestinal Obstruction;Intestines;Knowledge;Lactoferrin;Life;Liver;Lung;Male Genital Organs;Measures;Modeling;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Mouse Strains;Mucociliary Clearance;Mutation;Neonatal;Organ;Pancreas;Pancreatic Diseases;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Patients;Prevention;Production;Program Research Project Grants;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Recurrence;Research Personnel;Sampling;Sinus;Structural defect;Sweat Glands;Time;Vas deferens structure;animal care;cystic fibrosis mouse;disease-causing mutation;experience;gene therapy;improved;in vitro Model;lung imaging;meetings;mortality;programs;promoter;reproductive tract;sample collection;success;vector","Core A:  Animal Models","CORE A  ANIMAL MODELSPROJECT NARRATIVECystic fibrosis is a common life-shortening genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure due torecurrent infections and chronic inflammation.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Twenty-five years after the discovery of the CFTR gene and identification of its functions we lack answers to many crucial questions current treatments are inadequate and cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life shortening lethal disease. A major barrier to progress has been lack of a CF animal model other than the mouse. Project leaders in this PPG developed the ferret and pig models of CF to overcome this impediment. Remarkably these models develop lung disease with many similarities to that of human babies with CF. In this Program four senior and highly accomplished investigators and their teams will seize the unique opportunity to use CF ferrets and pigs as tools to investigate novel episomal and integrating gene transfer vectors. They will test the efficacy of gene transfer in correcting key physiologic defects that arise from loss of CFTR function. Studies with gene transfer vectors will be complemented by novel transgenic ferret and pig models expressing CFTR in a cell type specific or inducible manner. Program scientists will use several novel surrogate endpoints developed in the PPG to probe relationships between CFTR function and correction of biological and pathophysiological endpoints to judge efficacy. They will be guided by how complementation of CFTR function modifies airway biology including Cl- and HCO3 - transport host defense and mucociliary transport. The Project Leaders have an outstanding track record of collaboration in CF research and here they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their research is highly creative and is supported by five cores that provide innovative services and infrastructure. Discoveries from this PPG will accelerate development of novel therapies for patients who suffer from this devastating disease.","Address;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Anions;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Area;Bicarbonates;Biological;Biological Assay;Biology;Birth;Capsid;Cells;Collaborations;Complement;Confounding Factors (Epidemiology);Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Electrolytes;Epithelium;Family suidae;Ferrets;Gene Dosage;Gene Transfer;Gland;Goals;Host Defense;Host Defense Mechanism;Human;In Vitro;Infection;Inflammation;Killings;Knowledge;Lentivirus Vector;Life;Lung;Lung diseases;Measurement;Mediating;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mus;Newborn Infant;Pathogenesis;Patients;Physiological;Plague;Positioning Attribute;Prevention;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Regulator Genes;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Scientist;Services;Structure of respiratory epithelium;Surface;Surrogate Endpoint;System;Technology;Time;Transgenic Model;Transgenic Organisms;Viscosity;Work;adeno-associated viral vector;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;cell type;cystic fibrosis airway;efficacy testing;gene discovery;gene therapy;gene transfer vector;in vivo;inducible gene expression;innovation;insight;mortality;novel;novel therapeutics;prevent;programs;promoter;research study;respiratory;targeted treatment;tool;vector","Gene Therapy For Cystic Fibrosis Lung Disease","NARRATIVE - OVERALL PROGRAMThe overarching goal of this program is to advance gene-based therapies to prevent or treat CF airwaydisease.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular recognition is at the heart of biology and many biotechnological applications. If cheap and robust synthetic receptors can be prepared for arbitrarily selected drugs carbohydrate or oligopeptides numerous new technologies and biomedical tools will become possible. Improved drug analysis extraction of drugs or biomolecules from their natural milieu novel sensors intervention of biomolecular recognition and replacing expensive antibodies in affinity chromatography are but some of the possibilities enabled by such antibody-mimicking materials.  Molecular imprinting is a powerful way of making synthetic receptors. Although molecularly imprinted polymers sometimes referred to as ""plastic antibodies"" have found applications in chemical and biological sensing enzyme-like catalysis and separation there are significant challenges facing this technology including heterogeneous binding sites low percentage of high-affinity binding sites incomplete template removal and difficulty in imprinting in water.  The overall objective of this proposal is to fill he gap in the knowledge by developing protein-mimicking molecularly imprinted receptors for a broad range of biologically interesting molecules. The proposed molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) can be prepared and purified in 2-3 days without any special techniques as long as the cross- linkable surfactants and other cross-linkers are available. The MINP receptors typically 3-5 nm in diameter resemble proteins in size hydrophilic exterior and tailored hydrophobic binding pockets in the core but easily tolerate long-term storage high temperatures and organic solvents due to their heavy cross-linking.  The proposed research will lead to robust synthetic receptors for a wide range of biologically interesting guests including hydrophobic drugs carbohydrates and oligopeptides.

"Clinical Research; Dietary Supplements; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall causes of obesity are a sedentary lifestyle and excess energy intake also known as overnutrition. However the molecular mechanisms by which overnutrition generates obesity are not fully understood. We hypothesize that overnutrition causes mitochondrial dysfunction by leading to inhibitory protein acetylation. Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a precursor of NAD and supplementation with NR has been shown to reduce weight gain and metabolic dysfunction observed in a mouse model of overnutrition. Analysis of the mechanisms by which NR prevents weight gain may elucidate the molecular mechanisms that cause obesity.  This proposal is linked to a parent study of NR supplementation in the context of overnutrition which includes both a mouse model and a randomized placebo-controlled pilot study in human adults. The parent study will use mechanistic methods to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on NAD metabolism in mice given overnutrition. In the human pilot study the parent study will test the hypothesis that NR supplementation will prevent weight gain in humans in the context of overnutrition. The objective of this K01 proposal is to evaluate alterations in the NAD- targeted and global metabolome that accompany nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation in both mice and humans and correlate these metabolomic changes with outcomes (e.g. prevention of weight gain) in both the mouse mechanistic studies and the human clinical trial. The use of metabolomics in both the mouse and human study provides a unique opportunity to identify novel biomarkers of weight gain and NR supplementation and to link these biomarkers with clinically significant changes in NAD metabolism.  The first aim is to evaluate the impact of NR supplementation on the comprehensive NAD metabolome in accessible biological samples. We hypothesize that the NAD metabolome will demonstrate changes associated with increased NAD utilization by SIRT3 a mitochondrial protein deacetylase. We will use NAD-targeted metabolomic analyses of urine blood and feces to evaluate alterations in NAD metabolism associated with NR supplementation.  The second aim will explore the impact of NR supplementation in a non-targeted metabolomic analysis. We hypothesize that NR may prevent weight gain by altering metabolic pathways involved in energy expenditure. We will use non-targeted metabolomic analyses and identify important metabolomic profile changes with single value decomposition-based approaches. The results of this project will shed light on the underlying molecular mechanisms that cause obesity and may identify mechanisms for preventing obesity in the context of overnutrition.","Acetates;Adipose tissue;Adult;Affect;American;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Blood;Body Weight;Budgets;Characteristics;Chronic Disease;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Deacetylase;Development;Dietary Intervention;Energy Intake;Energy Metabolism;Epidemic;Evaluation;Exhibits;Fatty Liver;Feces;Functional disorder;Genetic;Health;High Fat Diet;Human;Individual;Insulin;Intake;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Light;Link;Liver;Liver Mitochondria;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Methods;Micronutrients;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Proteins;Molecular;Mus;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;Nutrient;Nutritional;Obesity;Outcome;Overnutrition;Overweight;Parents;Pathway interactions;Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell;Physical activity;Pilot Projects;Placebo Control;Placebos;Play;Production;Protein Acetylation;Proteome;Randomized;Reactive Oxygen Species;Resistance;Risk;Role;Sampling;Serum;Skeletal Muscle;Supplementation;Testing;Translating;Urine;Vitamins;Waste Products;Weight Gain;Work;base;blood lipid;blood product;clinically significant;effective intervention;feeding;human study;human tissue;improved;metabolome;metabolomics;mitochondrial dysfunction;mouse model;nicotinamide-beta-riboside;novel marker;obesogenic;oxidation;prevent;sedentary lifestyle;wasting;weight gain prevention","Metabolomic Biomarkers of a Nutritional Intervention to Prevent Weight Gain","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Obesity and overweight affect almost two thirds of Americans.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Pediatric","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children with specific language impairment (SLI) a spoken language impairment in the absence of any obvious causal factors make up about 7% of the population and have substantially poorer long-term academic and social outcomes as compared to their peers. During the preschool years deficits in acquisition and use of grammatical morphology and syntax are among the most commonly observed impairments. Current interventions for morphology and syntax have limited efficacy (Law et al. 2004). Enhanced language intervention techniques would improve the long-term positive outcomes for this population. This research grant draws on input-driven approaches to typical language learning which propose that highly frequent examples help scaffold acquisition of grammatical constructions by providing a stable exemplar to facilitate linking the meaning of grammatical construction to the form. Similarly theories of word learning and learning of artificial grammars suggest that using atypical exemplars may promote learning to a greater degree as compared to highly typical exemplars. The research program extends these theories to intervention by using computational modeling and behavioral methods for the purpose of examining the role of stimulus selection and presentation on intervention outcomes. Two early- efficacy studies will be carried out. One is focused on teaching children with SLI to use past tense using two different means of selecting verbs for use in intervention. The second is focused on teaching a novel morpheme to children with SLI and children with typical language using three different input distributions. The results of the behavioral studies will be linked to computational models enabling us to test input structures and means of selecting stimuli that go beyond what is feasible to examine behaviorally. This will make it possible to test hypotheses about what will improve interventions more efficiently than with traditional behavioral methods alone. The investigator has substantial experience working with children with SLI and assessing the use of grammatical morphology in children. However she lacks expertise in the areas of computational modeling design of intervention studies and communicating results to speech pathologists. The training component of this grant will ensure that the investigator is capable of using computational modeling techniques in concert with behavioral results to better understand how children learn. It will also enhance the investigator's ability to independently carry out intervention studies and communicate research results to practitioners. The University of Iowa is well known for work in the areas of specific language impairment and computational modeling and has a long history of clinically relevant research. Extant collaborations between researchers in psychology and communications disorders make this an ideal environment for this training to take place. The training opportunities will help the investigator launch an independent research career that investigates ways to improve remedi-ation of language disorders.","Ache;Adult;Affect;Anomia;Area;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Child;Collaborations;Color;Communication impairment;Complex;Computer Simulation;Data;Disease;Drops;Educational process of instructing;Ensure;Environment;Exposure to;Frequencies;Future;Goals;Grant;Health;Hearing;Impairment;Intervention;Intervention Studies;Iowa;Language;Language Development;Language Disorders;Learning;Link;Longevity;Methods;Modeling;Morphology;Nursery Schools;Outcome;Play;Population;Property;Psychology;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resistance;Role;Speech Pathologist;Stimulus;Structure;Students;Techniques;Testing;Training;Training Activity;Universities;Work;base;behavior observation;behavioral study;career;clinically relevant;experience;improved;innovation;insight;investigator training;language impairment;learning outcome;model design;novel;peer;phonology;programs;scaffold;social;specific language impairment;study characteristics;syntax;theories;tool;training opportunity;word learning","The role of stimulus properties on past tense acquisition in children with SLI","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Specific language impairment is an impairment in the use of language in the absence of any obvious causal disorders that affects approximately 7% of the pop-ulation.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S. major birth defects impact the morbidity and mortality of tens of thousands of children annually. An environmental exposure (broadly defined) or causal gene variant is estimated to explain only about one-third of all major defects that occur. Since 1996 the Iowa Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (CBDRP) has played a leadership role in surveillance and research of major birth defects. Our partnership with the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders provides timely and comprehensive active surveillance of each in-state delivery. Our partnership with the Iowa Department of Public Health provides outreach to families in all 99 Iowa counties. These partnerships have also allowed us to successfully enroll mothers in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) and related studies to collect environmental exposure and biological data. Using these data we have made substantial contributions to birth defects epidemiology ranging from methods development to identification of gene-environmental interaction effects. This work has provided critical insights into the etiology of several major birth defects and has been disseminated in high-impact journals. We propose to expand the work of the Iowa CBDRP through successful participation in the Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy Exposures (BD-STEPS). Our overall goal is to identify modifiable maternal exposures in early pregnancy that may increase the risk for having a pregnancy affected by certain major structural birth defects. We will conduct comprehensive and timely data collection and reporting for the BD-STEPS using our established and experienced surveillance and research infrastructure. We will also extend interdisciplinary collaborations to national and international scientists to increase dissemination of NBDPS and BD-STEPS findings in high-impact peer-reviewed journals. Our proposed research activities will use a ""scaffold"" approach for risk factor identification by simultaneously examining environmental exposures and gene variants from ""discovery"" to ""confirmation"" to ""interaction."" In particular we will continue our high-impact etiological studie of orofacial clefts and craniosynostosis and expand them to additional craniofacial and musculoskeletal defects. NBDPS and BD-STEPS data along with those from independent populations provided by our collaborators will offer rich resources for analyses of environmental exposures genes and gene-environmental interaction effects. Additionally we will continue our leadership role and expand our training program to develop junior investigators in birth defects research. Along with pre-doctoral students we will train clinical and research post- doctoral scholars in interdisciplinary team science for birth defects research. This research will encompass methodological etiological and translational studies. With our scientific expertise and highly experienced infrastructure we are well-positioned to successfully complete our proposed research and training. Research findings generated will be used for family education improvements in treatment and application of prevention strategies and training activities will contribute to the next generation of birth defect researchers.            "," ","Iowa CBDRP: Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS","Project NarrativeThe Iowa Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention in collaboration with premier scientists locallynationally and internationally will extend and expand its leadership role in the investigation of environmentalexposures genes and their potential interaction effects for major birth defects. This research will provideimportant insights into our understanding of modifiable factors to prevent or reduce the adverse consequencesof major birth defects. Findings will be shared with other scientists and with professionals developingappropriate prevention interventions and resources for families affected by major birth defects. __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__ SPECIFIC AIMSA major birth defect is an abnormality of an organ structure or function that results in physical disability mentaldisability or death1. In the U.S. these defects affect 1 in 33 newborns or about 125000 live births annuallyand are a leading cause of infant mortality2; 3. They also contribute significantly to infant morbidity and disabilityand result in the expenditure of millions of dollars annually in health care costs1; 4. The etiology of most majorbirth defects is unknown. An environmental exposure (broadly defined) or causal gene variant is thought toaccount for about 30% of the defects that occur. The remainder are most likely attributable to a confluence ofenvironmental and genetic effects and to a lesser extent factors such as intrauterine constraint and amnioticbands that can lead to deformations or disruptions of otherwise normally developed structures4. The suspected etiological heterogeneity among major birth defects combined with the rather lowprevalence of any individual defect poses challenges to conduct etiological studies with sufficient sample size.To meet this challenge the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded several case-controlstudies. For over 20 years the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders (IRCID) has participated insuch studies including the Birth Defects Risk Factor Surveillance Study (BDRFS) Centers for Birth DefectsResearch and Prevention (CBDRPs) which included the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS)and the Population Study of Craniosynostosis (PSOC). The IRCID has also participated in additional case-control studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Through these studies we established anexperienced interdisciplinary program infrastructure for surveillance and research of major birthdefects and made important contributions to understanding the impact of environmental exposuresand gene variants along with their interaction effects on the etiology of several birth defects. With our established program infrastructure we are well-positioned to successfully complete all requiredactivities for the Birth Defects Study to Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS). Our overall goal is toidentify modifiable maternal exposures in early pregnancy which may increase the risk for having a pregnancyaffected with a major birth defect. We hypothesize that these defects may arise from the independent effects ofsuch exposures and that these effects may be modified by co-environmental exposures and maternal and fetalgenetic susceptibilities. Our proposed approach will take full advantage of our experienced projectmanagement team to successfully direct execute and report on the following specific aims.Aim 1. Conduct comprehensive and timely data collection and reporting for the BD-STEPS.The population-based (statewide) active surveillance infrastructure of the IRCID will be used to conductcomprehensive and timely ascertainment and classification of case infants and timely ascertainment ofunaffected live born control infants. Our experienced research staff members will expertly conduct requiredrecruitment mailings specimen collection and data transfers.Aim 2. Extend interdisciplinary collaborations to national and international scientists to increasedissemination of NBDPS and BD-STEPS findings in high-impact peer-reviewed journals.Ongoing collaborations with University of Iowa (UI) and CBDRP investigators will be continued. Collaborationswill be extended to additional UI NIH and national and international investigators. NBDPS BD-STEPS andrelated case-control interview data will be analyzed to identify associations with environmental exposures;specimens from these studies will be analyzed by high-throughput approaches to identify gene variants andgene-environmental interaction effects. Findings will be replicated in independent study populations.Aim 3. Expand our training program to develop a future generation of birth defect researchers.We will continue to use NBDPS data and add BD-STEPS data as a resource for preceptorship thesis anddissertation research to train master's- and doctoral-level students. We will expand our training program to UIprograms for post-doctoral scholars to contribute to developing a future generation of birth defect researchers. Our proposed approach is consistent with the required activities for BD-STEPS and also recommendationsfrom a recent workshop co-sponsored by the CDC and NIH to use a ""scaffold"" approach for gene discovery5.We will expand this concept to apply a ""scaffold"" approach to discovery and confirmation of genesand environmental exposures and investigation of gene-environmental interaction effects for selectedmajor birth defects. NBDPS and BD-STEPS interview data and biological specimens along with data andspecimens from independent study populations will provide us with unparalleled resources to identifyetiological factors for selected major birth defects. Our findings will be important steps in suggesting targets fordeveloping clinical treatments during pregnancy and other public health strategies for primary and secondaryprevention of these defects.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) prevents skeletal muscle from carrying out this important function. Dysregulation of glucose metabolism precipitates high rates of metabolic syndrome diabetes and other secondary health conditions (SHCs) of SCI. These SHCs exert a negative influence on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). New discoveries support that a low level of activity throughout the day offers a more effective metabolic stimulus than brief episodic exercise bouts. The proposed study will translate this emerging concept to the population of individuals with SCI by using low-force long-duration electrical muscle stimulation to subsidize daily activity levels. Recently we demonstrated that this type of stimulation up-regulates key genes that foster an oxidative insulin-sensitive phenotype in paralyzed muscle. We will now test whether this type of activity can improve glucose homeostasis and metabolic function in patients with chronic paralysis. We hypothesize that improvements in metabolic function will be accompanied by a reduction in SHCs and a concomitant improvement in self-reported HRQOL. Three specific aims will address these hypotheses. Aim 1 will compare 2 doses of non-tetanizing stimulation (1 and 3 Hz) on muscle fatigue resistance and cellular adaptations in pathways that promote oxidative metabolism muscle fiber type and mitochondrial biogenesis. Aim 2 will compare the effects of these same 2 frequencies of stimulation on clinically-important metrics of metabolic function and systemic inflammation. Finally Aim 3 will measure SHCs and HRQOL in the training cohorts versus individuals who receive standard care (no muscular activation). We hypothesize that metabolic improvements achieved in Specific Aim 2 will be associated with fewer SHCs and higher self-reported HRQOL in patients with chronic SCI. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a rehabilitation strategy to protect the musculoskeletal health metabolic function and health-related quality of life of people living with complete SCI. This study is novel because it uses an intervention that is feasible low-cost and is rated to be convenient and unobtrusive by our pilot subjects. This intervention has excellent potential for efficacy and is likely to be economical and easily integrated into the daily lives of individuals with SCI.","Address;Biogenesis;C-reactive protein;Cardiovascular Diseases;Carrier Proteins;Cell Respiration;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Cost Savings;Diabetes Mellitus;Dose;Electric Stimulation;Electron Transport;Endocrine Glands;Energy Metabolism;Enzymes;Exercise;Fatigue;Fiber;Fostering;Frequencies;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Proteins;General Population;Genes;Glucagon;Glucose;Glycosylated Hemoglobin;Goals;Health;Home environment;Homeostasis;Hour;Human;Individual;Inflammation;Insulin;Interleukin-6;Intervention;Life;Limb structure;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolic Control;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Methods;Mitochondria;Modeling;Muscle;Muscle Fatigue;Muscle Fibers;Muscle Mitochondria;Musculoskeletal;Musculoskeletal System;OPA1 gene;Obesity;Paralysed;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Phenotype;Physiologic pulse;Physiological;Play;Population;Property;Protective Agents;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Regulation;Rehabilitation therapy;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Risk;Role;Skeletal Muscle;Spinal cord injury;Stimulus;Stress;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Training;Translating;Wheelchairs;base;blood glucose regulation;cohort;cost;cost effective;cytokine;exercise program;experience;fibroblast growth factor 21;glucose metabolism;health related quality of life;improved;innovation;mortality;novel;oral glucose tolerance;physical inactivity;prevent;rehabilitation strategy;standard care;transcription factor","Long Duration Activity and Metabolic Control after Spinal Cord Injury","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Contemporary rehabilitation does not intervene to protect the function of paralyzed skeletal muscle as a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis. Metabolic dysregulation causes secondary health conditions (SHCs) that exert a strongly negative effect upon health-related quality of life of individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Most people with SCI already have significant SHCs (diabetes etc.) because of metabolic dysregulation. A method to improve these SHCs would not only provide substantial cost savings but also could profoundly improve the quality of life of individuals living with SCI. A pressing need exists for alow-cost feasible and efficacious method to protect the musculoskeletal health metabolic function and health-related quality of life of patients with SCI. An ideal intervention would be readily transferable into the clinic and into home-based exercise programs.","NICHD","9116251","5/4/2016","PA-13-302","5R01HD082109-02","5","R01","HD","082109","02","","NITKIN, RALPH M","8/1/2015","4/30/2020","Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation Sciences Study Section[MRS]"," ","6255886","SHIELDS, RICHARD K.","Not Applicable","01","OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2016","4/30/2017"," ","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","312758"," ","NICHD","205425","107333"," ","312758",
"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations play a critical role in the etiology of many diseases such as autism schizophrenia diabetes and cancer. Most mutations arise during the replication of damaged DNA a process called translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS is carried out by specialized TLS polymerases which have evolved to accommodate DNA damage. Several fundamental unanswered questions about TLS polymerases remain. In Aim 1 we will address the following question: how are TLS polymerases recruited to stalled replication forks? To do this we will use both ensemble and single-molecule binding assays and steady state kinetics. These studies will reveal the mechanisms of TLS polymerase recruitment to ubiquitin-modified PCNA (UbPCNA) a key component of stalled replication forks. These studies will also reveal the structural motifs required for these interactions. In Aim 2 we will address the following question: how are TLS polymerases selected for recruitment to specific DNA lesions? To do this we will use ensemble and single-molecule binding assay. These studies will reveal the mechanisms of TLS polymerase selection and the influence of the DNA lesion on this process. In Aim 3 we will address the following question: how are TLS polymerases structurally organized at stalled replication fork? To do this we will use X-ray crystallography computationalmodeling and simulations and a variety of experimental distance measurements. These studies will provide the first glimpse of the structural organization of TLS polymerases within these protein-DNA complexes and will reveal how the different TLS polymerases are coordinated during the multi-step process of TLS.","Address;Autistic Disorder;Binding;Biological Assay;Cancer Etiology;Complex;Computer Simulation;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Replication Damage;DNA lesion;DNA replication fork;DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Enzymes;Etiology;Eukaryota;Funding;Germ Cells;Health;Kinetics;Laboratories;Lesion;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Modeling;Mutation;Play;Polymerase;Process;Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen;Proteins;Recruitment Activity;Roentgen Rays;Role;Schizophrenia;Somatic Cell;Structure;Ubiquitin;X-Ray Crystallography;base;flexibility;innovation;models and simulation;novel strategies;role model;scaffold;single molecule","Mechanisms of damaged DNA replication in eukaryotes","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mutations which play a critical role in causing many diseases mainly arise during the replication of damaged DNA.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kinase mediated tyrosine phosphorylation is a crucial component of cellular signaling cascades. Precise regulatory control over kinase activity must be maintained during signaling as evidenced by numerous human diseases that arise upon dysregulation of protein kinases. Given the crucial role of kinases in cell signaling these enzymes are key targets in treating numerous diseases. Traditional approaches for therapeutic targeting of kinases have involved small molecules that exert their effect directly on the kinase active site. Given the increasing instances of resistance to such drugs there is a need for devising new ways to target kinase activity. In our work on the Tec family tyrosine kinases (immunological kinases involved in signaling downstream of antigen receptors) we have characterized a number of specific allosteric sites and interactions that modulate the chemistry of the active site. These allosteric pockets are sometimes 30 angstrom removed from the active site or involve domains far from the kinase domain in primary sequence. The current application lays out specific aims to identify and characterize allosteric small molecule modulators of the Tec family kinases Itk and Btk. In addition we continue to move our understanding of Tec structure forward by solving the crystal structure of full length Btk. This will be the first strucure of any full length Tec kinase and the insight gained will facilitate further development of allosteric regulators for this family. We have established strong collaborations with immunologists that have extensive T- and B-cell signaling expertise (in particular as related to Itk and Btk).

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Health Services; Prevention; Rural Health","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 2200 deaths in Americans every day with one death every 39 seconds. There is evidence that these deaths can be prevented with better risk factor management however many risk factors remain uncontrolled. Patients with CVD have high levels of complexity and tend to have numerous chronic conditions. The Patient-Centered Medical Home including self- management personalized health records and team-based care is a strategy to improve care for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Managed care organizations have found that a centralized cardiovascular risk service managed can reduce mortality. It is not known if a Prevention Health & Cardiovascular Risk Service (PHCVRS) including cancer screening would be implemented in private office practices that lack clinical pharmacists or specialized nurses. Our long-range goal is to improve the management of patients with complex medical histories with team-based care. We have pioneered strategies to evaluate team care implementation and guideline adherence using cluster-randomized trials. The objective of this application is to conduct a multi-center cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized PHCVRS to support private medical offices in more rural areas that lack large integrated health plans. This study is titled ""Improved Cardiovascular Risk Reduction to Enhance Rural Primary Care: ICARE."" We will stratify and randomize 12 primary care offices in the Iowa Research Network (IRENE) to PHCVRS or usual care and enroll 300 subjects. We will also randomly select 25 patients per office (n=300 total n=600) into a passive observation group that will allow us to determine the extent to which the intervention diffuses more broadly for unexposed patients. Our central hypothesis is that the PHCVRS will significantly improve adherence to The Guideline Advantage metrics that are supported by five national organizations. The rationale for this proposed study is that implementation of a novel approach to improve management of CVD and cancer screening will lead to innovative strategies for broader adoption by health systems throughout the U.S. We will accomplish our objectives and test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To determine if a web-based PHCVRS will be implemented within private primary care offices. Aim 2: To determine if the PHCVRS intervention diffuses throughout the intervention offices. Our approach is innovative because it will ask the questions: ""Will the PHCVRS model be successfully implemented?"" as well as ""Is care management effective?"" These questions have not been addressed for patients with multiple chronic conditions in private practice. This study design is novel because it will: 1) be the most robust study to test this model using a cluster randomized design in small private practice clinics 2) evaluate whether the effect can be sustained long-term and 3) evaluate a ""passive observation group"" to determine if the intervention diffuses throughout the practice.","Address;Adherence;Adoption;American;American Cancer Society;American Heart Association;Behavior Therapy;Cancer Control;Cardiovascular Diseases;Caring;Cessation of life;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical Pharmacists;Cluster randomized trial;Complex;Control Groups;Diabetes Mellitus;Diffuse;Enrollment;Goals;Guideline Adherence;Guidelines;Health;Health Planning;Health system;Heart;Home environment;Intervention;Iowa;LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins;Lead;Literature;Managed Care;Medical;Medical History;Meta-Analysis;Modeling;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;Nurses;Online Systems;Patient Care;Patients;Pharmacists;Physicians;Prevention;Primary Health Care;Private Practice;Public Health;Randomized;Research;Research Design;Risk Factors;Risk Reduction;Rural;Screening for cancer;Self Management;Services;Strategic Planning;System;Testing;base;blood pressure regulation;cardiovascular risk factor;cost effective;cost effectiveness;design;effective care management;group intervention;health record;improved;innovation;mortality;multiple chronic conditions;novel;novel strategies;patient oriented;prevent;programs;rural area;service intervention;treatment as usual","Improved Cardiovascular Risk Reduction to Enhance Rural Primary Care:I-CARE","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because the implementation of strategies to efficiently provide care for patients with multiple chronic conditions will lead to improved and more comprehensive primary care.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Genetics; Hematology; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","The UI/MC SPORE Clinical Research Core (CRC) has as its primary goal to be the direct translational link between research projects and clinical research emanating from these projects. The specific aims of the CRC are to: 1) coordinate and perform SPORE clinical trials protocols; 2) manage SPORE observational epidemiology protocols and partner with the Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). The CRC provides a critical link between clinical research and the specific projects cores and developmental research. The CRC is co-directed by Thomas M. Habermann MD at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center and Brian Link MD at the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center. A key function of the CRC is to coordinate the development of clinical trials assist in patient accrual manage protocol amendments report adverse events te appropriate agencies and provide comprehensive quality control on clinical trial data. For the MER the CRC consents newly diagnosed lymphoma patients abstracts and enters clinical and epidemiologic data and systematically follows all MER patients through death. Tumor tissue and peripheral bleed serum cells DNA and RNA that are prospectively collected stored and tracked by the Biospecimens Core are linked to the CRC database. This provides SPORE investigators integrated and centralized access for lymphoma research projects. During the last funding cycle 10 therapeutic clinical trials were initiated or active including 2 InterSPORE trials. Overall we accrued 197 patients (331 since inception ofthe SPORE) to these SPORE clinical trials. Studies of novel agents such as the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib have been completed and published. For everolimus a new trial has been approved for NCCTG and combination trials of tipifarnib proposed. We also completed two trials using the immunostimulatory agent CpG. CpG will now be moved fonward in SPORE Project 2. During the last funding cycle 2461 patients were enrolled into the MER for a cumulative total of 4562 patients.

Three of these projects have received external peer-reviewed NCI funding or a fundable priority score 3 received a second year of funding and 3 provided data that was instrumental for the major research projects selected for this renewal. The Developmental Research Program will provide up to $50000 for one year ($25000 from UI/MC SPORE funds and a matching $25000 from institutional resources) to each of four projects each year with the possibility of a second year of support based on progress. It is anticipated that support of developmental research projects will continue to result in the generation of new hypotheses that will be tested in full UI/MC SPORE-sponsored projects or through peer reviewed external grant support. The long-term goal of the UI/MC SPORE program is to translate the findings generated by developmental projects into a reduction in the incidence and mortality rates of lymphoma. More specifically the objectives ef the Developmental Research Program are to: (1) encourage innovative translationally-relevant laboratory population and clinical studies in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (2) foster extensive collaboration between basic science population science and clinical disciplines in translational research in lymphoma; and (3) generate new hypotheses to be tested in large-scale research projects or clinical trials that may lead to significant reduction of lymphoma incidence and mortality. Brief outlines of four developmental research projects from investigators at the University of lowa and the Mayo Clinic are included to demonstrate the depth and breadth of ongoing research that can be applied to the translational lymphoma research at these institutions and could be eligible for UI/MC SPORE Developmental Program support.","Basic Science;Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Data;Development;Discipline;Fostering;Funding;Generations;Goals;Grant;Human;Incidence;Institution;Laboratories;Lead;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Patients;Peer Review;Phase;Population;Population Sciences;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Resources;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Testing;Translating;Translational Research;Universities;base;innovation;mortality;programs;sound","DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM","The UI/MC SPORE in Lymphoma Developmental Research Program (DRP) was established to fund early phase research that takes maximum advantage of UI/MC SPORE resources to generate feasibility data for projects that have the highest translational potential.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Genetics; Hematology; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","The Iowa-Mayo SPORE Biospecimens Shared Resource provides a coordinated centralized and dedicated core for the procurement processing and annotation of biospecimens from lymphoma patients and patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). The goal of the Biospecimens Core is to procure a variety of biologic specimens on all patients involved in UI/MC SPORE protocols and all newly diagnosed lymphoma patients seen at the University of lowa and the Mayo Clinic Rochester who are enrolled into the Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER). The specific aims of the Biospecimens Core are: 1) To provide accurate classification of all lymphomas from patients enrolled onto SPORE protocols and the MER; 2) To collect process bank and distribute biologic specimens from lowa and Mayo lymphoma patients for translational research; 3) To track all biospecimens and ensure linkage to clinical outcome and related data; and 4) Te serve as a resource of expertise collaborative support and service for projects. All specimens are collected and processed under tight quality control and distributed to SPORE researchers or banked for future SPORE research projects. These activities are tracked using a sophisticated database that merges the activities at lowa and Mayo and allows integration with clinical and other data collected in research projects. The Core provides specialized expertise in working with lymphoma biospecimens and is closely aligned with institutional research cores and shared resources but does not duplicate them. During the last funding period the Core collected biospecimens from 7 SPORE clinical trials (>1000 samples from 193 patients). The Core also reviewed and classified 2461 patients for enrollment into the MER and collected germline DNA on >2S00 and serum on >2100 ofthe MER patients. The Core additionally banked frozen cells on -400 patients. The Cere has supported all of the full projects and multiple Developmental and Career Development projects. There has been extensive utilization of biospecimens including use of paraffin and frozen tissue; frozen cells; germline DNA; and serum and plasma all leading to extensive publications involving the Core. The Biospecimens Core has also partnered on other projects that have obtained extramural funding to support epidemiologic studies family studies genome-wide association studies inter-SPORE studies and other R01and P01projects.

"Cancer; Genetics; Hematology; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","Recent advances in tumor biology have led to the identification of a variety of intracellular oncogenic pathways as potential targets for cancer therapy. Specifically many studies have found that activation of the JAK/STAT pathway promotes tumor cell proliferation and survival in various types of leukemia and lymphoma. Our preliminary data demonstrate aberrantly activated JAK2 and STAT3 in more than 50% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient samples. In vitro inhibition of JAK2 with the novel JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 (TG) inhibited JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in a variety of lymphoma cell lines and patient samples. In this proposal the overall goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying activation ofthe JAK/STAT pathway in lymphoma and to learn if inhibitors of this pathway can produce clinical benefit. We have identified several novel missense mutations in JAK2 and STAT3 genes. In Aim 1 we will characterize the biological and therapeutic significance of these mutations with a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (S0CS1) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (SHP1) are known key negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway. Our preliminary data demonstrate silencing of SHP1 and S0CS1 genes in 33% and 86% respectively of DLBCL lymphoma samples. In Aim 2 we will delineate the mechanisms of silencing and how this regulates JAK/STAT pathway activation. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is utilized by a number of growth factors and cytokines. We have identified increases in several JAK/STAT pathway-specific cytokines (IL-2 IL-6 IL-10 and EGF) in serum samples from patients with lymphoma compared to normal controls. In vitro we found in lymphoma cells that JAK2 and STAT3 are rapidly activated in response to IL-10. Aim 3 will investigate the role of signaling for these interieukins mediated through their receptors with a focus on IL-10. This project is based on solid preliminary data demonstrating that the JAK/STAT pathway is a key mechanism for lymphoma growth and survival. These data have guided the design ofthe phase II trial in Aim 4 that will test TG in patients with relapsed lymphoma. Correlative research using patient samples pre- and posttherapy with JAK/STAT pathway inhibitor will increase our understanding ofthe mechanisms of how this pathway is regulated at the molecular and genetic level. These basic and clinical studies working together aim to offer a new therapeutic approach for patients with lymphoma.","Apoptosis;Area;B-Cell Lymphomas;Biological;Biological Markers;Biological Response Modifier Therapy;CISH gene;Categories;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Cell Survival;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Coiled-Coil Domain;Cytokine Activation;Data;EGF gene;Genes;Goals;Growth;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;In Vitro;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-2;Interleukin-6;Investigation;JAK2 gene;Janus kinase 2;Learning;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Missense Mutation;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Target;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mutation;Myeloproliferative disease;NR0B2 gene;Oncogenic;Outcome;PTPN6 gene;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Play;Point Mutation;Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase;Regulation;Relapse;Research;Research Design;Role;STAT protein;STAT3 gene;Sampling;Serum;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;Solid;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Testing;Tumor Biology;Variation (Genetics);Work;base;cell growth;cytokine;design;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;kinase inhibitor;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;leukemia/lymphoma;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;patient stratification;phase II trial;pre-clinical;receptor;receptor binding;response;rituximab;targeted cancer therapy;targeted treatment;transcription factor;translational study;treatment strategy;trial design;tumor;tumor microenvironment","Targeting JAK2 Kinase in Lymphoma","Preliminary data from our lab indicate that the JAK/STAT pathway is frequently activated in lymphoma.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Cancer Genomics; Genetics; Hematology; Human Genome; Lymphoma; Prevention; Rare Diseases","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype. It is well established that there are driver somatic mutations in DLBCL etiology and prognosis as well as a role for germline genetic susceptibility. In fact early results from candidate gene association studies have shown a promising role for common genetic variants in immune and apoptotic genes in NHL. In the last funding cycle we identified SNPs in BCL2L11 (BIM) CASP9 and APAF1 that were associated with increased risk in our SPORE case-control study. Resequencing of these genes in the tumors of 40 DLBCL patients identified novel genomic alterations and in Aim 1 we propose to characterize the etiologic and therapeutic significance of these novel mutations with laboratory-based studies. In Aim 2 and 3 we propose a comprehensive and agnostic strategy that integrates both somatic and germline genetics in order to identify additional novel risk variants. We will do this by leveraging our SPORE's involvement in the large International Lymphoma Epidemiology (InterLymph) consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) of DLBCL (>S000 cases and 10000 controls) and our whole-exome next generation sequencing (NGS) study of paired tumor and germline DLBCL cases (N=77). The GWAS is powered to identify common variants and the NGS study will allow us to identify lower frequency variants defined here as 0.5% to 5%. Using a multistage design in Aim 2 we propose to identify novel germline low-frequency variants associated with risk of developing DLBCL and in Aim 3 we identify and validate somatically acquired driver mutations in genes critical to DLBCL pathogenesis. In exploratory analyses we will evaluate pathways and the role of these variants in DLBCL prognosis. This proposal utilizes the unique resources of our SPORE the InterLymph GWAS and our DLBCL whole-exome NGS project. We have an outstanding team with a strong track record of interdisciplinary genetics work in lymphoma and have demonstrated the ability to integrate genetic epidemiology with lab-based functional work. Our study builds on several novel findings from the prior study period but also expands to fill an important need in the genetic epidemiology of DLBCL as the first comprehensive study of low frequency germline variants in risk. Low frequency variants either individually or cumulatively across a gene and in combination with common variants are likely to inform etiologic pathways and clinical risk assessment. Furthermore we will identify novel driver mutations in genes and pathways from DLBCL tumors that can inform tumor biology and identify novel treatment targets. In summary as the first comprehensive study of both germline and somatic genetic variants in DLBCL we are likely to provide new and unexpected insights into lymphomagenesis which can then be exploited clinically for risk assessment prognostic stratification and identification of new treatment targets.","APAF1 gene;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;BCL2L11 gene;Bioinformatics;CASP9 gene;Candidate Disease Gene;Case-Control Studies;Cells;Clinical Medicine;Computer Simulation;DNA;DNA Resequencing;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Defect;Epidemiology;Etiology;Event;Frequencies;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genome;Genotype;Human;Immune;Institutes;International;Laboratories;Lymphoma;Lymphomagenesis;Malignant Neoplasms;Mutation;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Paraffin;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Play;Predisposition;Proteins;Public Health;Resources;Risk;Risk Assessment;Role;Sampling;Somatic Mutation;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Staging;Stratification;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Tumor Biology;Tumor Tissue;Validation;Variant;Work;actionable mutation;base;case control;clinical risk;design;exome;exome sequencing;follow-up;genetic epidemiology;genetic variant;genome wide association study;insight;interest;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;mutant;next generation sequencing;novel;outcome forecast;prognostic;risk variant;tumor","Genetic Epidemiology and Function of Germline and Somatic Variants in DLBCL","As the first comprehensive study of both germline and somatic genetic variants in DLBCL we are likely to provide new and unexpected insights into lymphomagenesis which can then be exploited clinically for risk assessment prognostic stratification and identification of new treatment targets.","NCI","9115088","6/30/2016","PAR-10-003","4P50CA097274-15","4","P50","CA","097274","15","",""," "," ","ZCA1-RPRB-7","7191","1888618","CERHAN, JAMES R","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","272388"," ","248907","23562"," "," ",
"Cancer; Hematology; Lymphoma; Rare Diseases","The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and the role intratumoral immune cells play in the pathology of lymphoma has been significantly understated. Intratumoral monocytes and macrophages are particularly important and our data demonstrate that intratumoral monocytes in NHL are highly immunosuppressive and support malignant cell growth. In preliminary work we found that suppressive monocytic cells (SMCs) are abundant within the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment in lymphoma patients and promote the survival of lymphoma cells. SMCs protect lymphoma cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death and promote lymphoma cell engraftment into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Furthermore we found that SMCs within lymph nodes express immunosuppressive ligands including B7-H1 (PD-L1 CD273) inhibit normal T-cell proliferation and promote the induction of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. These preliminary studies suggest that SMCs have an effect on both malignant NHL cells and non-malignant intratumoral T-cells. Based on our results we hypothesize that the intersection between the immune system and the malignant cell in NHL is the SMCs. In this proposal we plan to understand whether monocytes are specifically recruited to sites of lymphoma and which specific chemokines could be inhibited to prevent SMC migration; how lymphoma cells induce SMCs to support their malignant cell growth and to suppress the host's antitumor immunity; and whether promoting monocyte/macrophage maturation or inhibiting their interaction with other cells particularly in the presence of monoclonal antibodies improves their anti-tumor function. Upon completion of this project we expect to have a greater understanding of the role of monocytes and their progeny in NHL. Collectively our findings are likely to have a major impact by leading to an effective monocyte-directed therapeutic approach for patients with lymphoma.","Cell Death;Cells;Data;Engraftment;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunosuppressive Agents;Inflammation;Ligands;Lymphoma;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Monoclonal Antibodies;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Non-Malignant;PDCD1LG1 gene;Pathology;Patients;Play;Population;Recruitment Activity;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Role;SCID Mice;Site;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;System;T-Cell Proliferation;T-Lymphocyte;Therapeutic;Work;base;cancer cell;cell growth;cell motility;chemokine;chemotherapy;improved;lymph nodes;macrophage;monocyte;novel therapeutic intervention;pathogen;peripheral blood;prevent;tumor;tumor microenvironment","The Role of Monocytes in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma","The monocyte-macrophage system is critical in the host's response to pathogens and inflammation.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Hematology; Immunization; Lymphoma; Nanotechnology; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related","Immunotherapy of lymphoma through in situ manipulation of an involved lymph node can allow for development of an active anti-lymphoma immune response without the need for ex vivo handling or immunization with a specific antigen. A comprehensive and successful approach to in situ immunization in lymphoma would require effective presentation of antigen by the lymphoma cells or professional antigenpresenting cells activation of lymphoma-specific T cells and suppression of the regulatory arm of the immune response to enhance development of a sustained anti-lymphoma T cell response. The current proposal evaluating a novel approach to in situ immunization is based on scientific advances made possible through the UI/MC SPORE over the prior funding period. The overall hypothesis is that in situ immunization with nanoparticles will allow for induction and maintenance of a robust anti-lymphoma immune response with acceptable toxicity. To test this hypothesis this project will assess the effect of intratumoral injection of nanoparticles (NPs) containing doxorubicin (dox) on lymphoma cells the immune microenvironment and the anti-lymphoma immune response in animal models and in a Phase I clinical trial in subjects with lymphoma. It will then assess the effect of intratumoral injection of NPs containing both dox and the toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist CpG ODN (CpG dox NPs) in mice and humans. Finally it will assess how agents capable of maintaining the T cell response impact on the success of in situ immunization with NP. Successful development of such an approach to in situ immunization would be of great significance as a way to treat lymphoma and could be applicable to other cancers as well.","Agonist;Animal Model;Antigen Presentation;Antigens;Cells;Clinical;Development;Doxorubicin;Funding;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunization;Immunotherapy;In Situ;Injection of therapeutic agent;Lymphoma;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mus;Patients;Phase I Clinical Trials;Research Design;Scientific Advances and Accomplishments;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;TLR9 gene;Testing;Toxic effect;arm;base;lymph nodes;nanoparticle;novel strategies;success","In Situ Immunization Using Nanoparticles","There continues to be a need for new treatments for lymphoma.

At the center of the ongoing success of the UI/MC SPORE is the collaborative interaction between investigators at lowa and Mayo as well as SPORE basic laboratory clinical and population-based investigators. The overall goal of the SPORE is to support innovative interactive translational research into lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia that leverages the expertise of laboratory clinical and population-based research at both institutions.Over the last funding period the SPORE has been highly productive as demonstrated by identification of new tumor markers scientific findings that led to additional translational lymphoma grants from the NCI multiple publications including many authored by investigators from both institutions and brisk accrual to translational clinical trials. The UI/MC Molecular Epidemiology Resource is based in the SPORE and serves as a vital resource for both SPORE research and research projects supported by other grants. The current proposal will build on past successes and support 4 major research projects that represent new concepts that emerged from research supported over the past funding period. Support will also be provided to pursue novel translational concepts in lymphoma research and new investigators through the Developmental Research and Career Development programs. Finally the SPORE will enhance the infrastructure that supports translational lymphoma research at both institutions through shared core resources in Administration Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Biospecimens and Clinical Research.","Advocate;Back;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biometry;Cancer Research Project;Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Sciences;Collaborations;Comprehensive Cancer Center;Development;Disease;Environment;Evaluation;Functional disorder;Funding;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Human;Immunization;Immunoglobulins;In Situ;Institution;International;JAK2 gene;Laboratories;Light;Lymphoma;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Molecular;Molecular Epidemiology;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Patients;Peer Review;Peer Review Grants;Phosphotransferases;Population Sciences;Publications;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Support;Resources;Risk;Role;Serum;Specialized Program of Research Excellence;Staging;Testing;Therapeutic Clinical Trial;Translational Research;Tumor Markers;Universities;Validation;Variant;Vitamin D;base;career development;clinical practice;cytokine;design;follow-up;genetic epidemiology;innovation;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;malignant lymphocyte;monocyte;nanoparticle;novel;outcome forecast;population based;programs;research and development;success;translational clinical trial","Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Human Cancer","RELEVANCE: The UI/MC SPORE provides support for translational research into lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia designed to have a rapid impact on the patients with these malignant disorders.","NCI","9115084","6/30/2016","PAR-10-003","4P50CA097274-15","4","P50","CA","097274","15","","KUZMIN, IGOR A","9/11/2002","6/30/2017","ZCA1-RPRB-7(M1)"," ","1864794","WEINER, GEORGE J.","WITZIG, THOMAS E.","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," ","397","Research Centers","2016","2161375"," ","NCI","1961519","240735"," ","2161375",
"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Cancer; Immunization","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The fragment crystallizable (Fc) region links the dual pathogen identification and destruction properties of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Pathogen opsonization positions Fcs to activate pro-inflammatory Fc receptors (FcgRs) on immune cells. Asparagine-linked (N)-glycan attached to Fc is required for productive engagement of the low-affinity FcgRs though it is not known how the Fc N-glycan contributes to FcR binding because the N-glycan does not directly contact the FcgRs. It has been suggested that the N-glycan provides optimal spacing of two Fc domains stabilizing the Fc quaternary structure to bind the FCR. Evidence from our laboratory points to a different hypothesis. We determined that Fc N-glycan motion increased by Fc amino acid mutations far from the FcR binding site negatively correlated with FcRIIIa affinity. Only a single region of Fc the CE polypeptide loop that contains the site of N-glycosylation was perturbed as a result of these Fc mutations. This result led to the proposal that the N-glycan affects FcR affinity by pre-organizing the CE loop and notby optimizing Fc domain orientation. Here we will directly test our hypothesis by measuring the structure and motion of the CE loop in multiple forms stabilized through glycan or protein engineering using solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The knowledge of CE loop structure and motion will be applied to redesign the Fc polypeptide to generate aglycosylated Fc variants that maintain high affinity for FcgRs. The molecular details of immune system activation that will emerge from these studies will be important to understand the process of multiple diseases and will be critical to enhance therapeutic monoclonal antibody function through engineering to treat cancer transplant and autoimmune disease patients.","Affect;Affinity;Amino Acids;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antibodies;Antibody -dependent cell cytotoxicity;Asparagine;Autoimmune Diseases;Binding;Binding Sites;Carbohydrates;Cells;Crystallography;Development;Disease;Engineering;Fc Receptor;Glycoproteins;Goals;Graft Rejection;Health;Hematologic Neoplasms;Human;Immune;Immune system;Immunoglobulin G;Immunoglobulins;Inflammatory;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Libraries;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Measures;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Monoclonal Antibodies;Motion;Mutation;N-Glycosylation Site;NMR Spectroscopy;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Polysaccharides;Positioning Attribute;Preparation;Process;Production;Property;Protein Engineering;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Reporting;Resolution;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Role;Sampling;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Stable Isotope Labeling;Structural Biochemistry;Structure;Surface;System;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies;Therapeutic antibodies;Transplant-Related Disorder;Variant;Work;base;cancer therapy;design;improved;leukemia/lymphoma;novel;novel therapeutics;pathogen;personalized medicine;polypeptide;receptor;receptor binding;research study;response;tool","Mechanism and engineering of IgG-based monoclonal antibody/receptor interactions","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to investigate immune system activation notably the atomic details of how immunoglobulin G binds to receptors of the surface of immune cells to elicit a protective response.

Furthermore the President has provided asignificant level of focus on food safety nationally as has Congress with the passage of the FoodSafety Modernization Act. Similarly within Iowa we have found an added interest in food safety.The Bureau has experienced a substantial surge in the number of small local producers seekingto begin manufacturing foods. We identified that we were no longer able to keep up with thegrowing number of questions and requests to provide assistance and speak to various groups.As part of the MFRPS contract funding option the Bureau requested funding to help answerthese questions. The Bureau used existing staff in October 2011 and hired a new staff personto assist in this area using the MFRPS funding option in November 2011. Continuing thisendeavor is absolutely essential to meet the needs of Iowans interested in adding value toagricultural commodities. However the State's resources are currently not adequate to respondto the growing needs of producers and consumers across Iowa.The Bureau anticipates participation in this cooperative agreement will result in significantenhancement in the quality of inspections and inspectors for Iowa's manufactured food facilities.This will be obtained by the following:  The State will achieve and sustain significant to full conformance with the Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS);  The State has and will continue to actively engage through an annual face-to- face meeting and participation in committees supporting MFRPS;  The State has and will collaboratively develop strategies and share those strategies with other states;  The State will provide FDA the foundation for pursuing regulatory action based upon the findings of State manufactured food regulatory programs; and  The State will seek to further enhance its capability to protect public health through development and implementation of Standard Enhancement Projects.The goal of this project is to attain full conformance.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Airway infection begins the cascade of inflammation and pathology that destroys the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Therefore early intervention aimed at correcting the initial host defense defects could dramatically improve the course of CF lung disease. We discovered that in newborn CF pigs the ASL was more acidic and bacterial killing was impaired. Reducing ASL pH in non-CF pigs inhibited bacterial killing and raising ASL pH in CF pigs rescued bacterial killing. These results directly link the loss of CFTR an anion channel that facilitates HCO3"" transport to an initial host defense defect. We studied children with CF and found that like newborn CF pigs they had reduced ASL pH. However in adults ASL pH did not differ between CF and non-CF suggesting that the inflammation associated with chronic disease may have elevated the pH. In preliminary work we found that cultured porcine CF airway epithelia lack cAMP stimulated HCOs"" transport but freshly isolated CF airway epithelia retain some HCO3' secretion. The overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that control ASL pH in CF airways and to learn how pH influences bacterial killing by ASL antimicrobial peptides and proteins. To achieve our goals we will use a novel porcine model of CF that will allow us to investigate the airways immediately after birth and then as airway disease progresses. Aim 1. Does respiratory virus infection and/or bacteria-induced inflammation change ASL pH and bacterial killing? Infection with common respiratory viruses predisposes infants to airway bacterial infections. We hypothesize that loss of CFTR hinders a normal compensatory response that enhances anti-bacterial activity and thereby increases the risk to CF airways of bacterial infection. Conversely we hypothesize that the onset of inflammation with early bacterial infections triggers enhanced ASL alkalinization as well as antimicrobial peptide production. Discovering the mechanistic bases by which inflammation enhances bacterial killing in CF will suggest interventions to augment antibacterial innate immunity. Aim 2: How is HCO3"" secretion regulated in CF airway epithelia? In the absence of CFTR CF airway epithelia can still support some HCO3"" secretion. We will identify the channels and transporters that control HCO3"" secretion and we will learn how inflammation modifies their expression. The results will suggest potential means to raise ASL pH in CF airways and enhance bacterial killing prior to the onset of disease. Aim 3: How does pH affect bacterial killing by ASL antimicrobial peptides? Preliminary data show that reduced pH inhibits bacterial killing by some antimicrobial peptides. Our working hypothesis is that pH affects charge-dependent binding of antimicrobial peptides to the bacterial cell wall and hence killing. We will also identify bacterial genes that interfere with normal pH-sensitive antimicrobial peptide killing. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these processes will aid understanding of why some bacteria are resistant to ASL antimicrobials.","Adult;Affect;Alkalinization;Anions;Anti-Bacterial Agents;Bacteria;Bacterial Genes;Bacterial Infections;Bicarbonates;Binding;Birth;Cell Wall;Charge;Chronic Disease;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Early Intervention;Epithelial;Family suidae;Functional disorder;Goals;Host Defense;Infant;Infection;Infection prevention;Inflammation;Instruction;Intervention;Killings;Knowledge;Learning;Link;Liquid substance;Lung;Modeling;Natural Immunity;Newborn Infant;Onset of illness;Pathology;Physiology;Prevention;Process;Production;Proteins;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Reporting;Risk;Surface;Work;airway epithelium;antimicrobial;antimicrobial peptide;bacterial resistance;base;children with cystic fibrosis;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis airway epithelia;early cystic fibrosis;falls;improved;novel;prevent;respiratory infection virus;respiratory virus;response","Airway pH and antimocrobial activity in early cystic fibrosis","RELEVANCE (See instructions): Airway infection begins the cascade of inflammation and pathology that destroys the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF).

"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): In cystic fibrosis (CF) a defect in mucosal defenses leads to airway colonization with bacteria inflammation remodeling and tissue destruction. The disease is progressive and life limiting. Recent studies indicate that loss of CFTR function reduces bicarbonate permeability across the airway epithelium and lowers the pH of airway surface liquid (ASL) impairing the function of secreted host defense factors. This may be among the earliest events favoring colonization. Respiratory viral infections may also contribute to development of lung disease in infants and children with CF. Epidemiologic data indicate that respiratory virus infections cause prolonged symptoms in children with CF induce exacerbations and enhance bacterial colonization. While clinical studies and limited in vitro data suggest the possibility of altered responses to viruses in CF this is an experimentally difficult problem to study in humans. Our central hypothesis is that virus infections contribute to disease onset and progression in CF. The CF pig model manifests a respiratory tract host defect at birth and spontaneously develops lung disease with many similarities to human infants with CF. The objective of. our studies is to use this model to investigate the contribution of virus infections to early CF lung disease. We will test our central hypothesis using model virus infections and by pursuing the following three specific aims: Aim 1. Do CFTR dependent changes in ASL environment allow respiratory viruses to infect airway epitheliamore readily?  Aim 2. Do changes in interferon induction and responsiveness enhance respiratory virus infections in CF? Aim 3. Does CF alter the resolution phase ofthe response to respiratory virus infections? Leveraging the porcine CF model to study CF and non-CF responses to viral infections in vitro and in vivo is a novel approach to investigate human disease mechanisms. These complementary strategies should provide new insights into the early steps in CF lung disease pathogenesis that will inform future therapeutic strategies.","Airway Obstruction;Anions;Area;Bacteria;Bicarbonates;Birth;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Environment;Epithelial;Event;Family suidae;Functional disorder;Future;Gland;Host Defense;Human;In Vitro;Infant;Infection;Inflammation;Instruction;Interferons;Intervention;Learning;Life;Lung;Lung diseases;Modeling;Mucous body substance;Onset of illness;Pathogenesis;Permeability;Phase;Physiology;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Research;Resolution;Respiratory System;Respiratory tract structure;Role;Staging;Symptoms;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Viral Respiratory Tract Infection;Virus;Virus Diseases;airway epithelium;airway remodeling;airway surface liquid;children with cystic fibrosis;early cystic fibrosis;early onset;epidemiologic data;human disease;improved;in vivo;insight;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;prevent;respiratory infection virus;respiratory virus;response","Respiratory virus infection in early cystic fibrosis lung disease","RELEVANCE (See instructions): Factors contributing to the early onset and progression of cystic fibrosis lung disease remain incompletely understood preventing advances in new therapies.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease begins during infancy. With the advent of universal newborn CF screening there is an opportunity to intervene early to prevent the airway disease that ultimately destroys the lungs. However to forestall CF airway disease we must understand its initiation and progression. It is known that CF patients manifest a defect in airway host defense. One important component of host defense is mucociliary transport (MCT) the removal of particulates and pathogens from airways. It is widely assumed that impaired MCT causes CF lung disease. That assumption derives primarily from the fact that MCT is defective when disease is advanced. However by that time bronchiectasis could be responsible. Unfortunately current tests of MCT have limited sensitivity and often fail to detect defects even in CF adults. Lack of a model has prevented elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to understand the causes of CF airway disease and use that knowledge to prevent and treat disease. The objective of this proposal is to learn how CF alters MCT and discover the responsible mechanisms. To achieve that objective we will study a novel porcine model of CF that closely parallels the human disease and we will answer three general questions. Aim 1. Does loss of CFTR alter MCT in newborn pigs? We will focus on MCT in vivo at the genesis of disease. We have exciting preliminary data using a new in vivo MCT assay and interrogation of discrete particles. We predict that stimulating mucus secretion will reveal striking MCT heterogeneity in CF pigs with some particles moving fast some slow and some not moving at all. Aim 2. Does the development of CF airway disease impair MCT in vivo? CF is not a static disease. Once it begins in neonates inflammation viral and bacterial infections and airway wall remodeling accelerate disease. We will be able to learn for the first time how MCT changes with time and how those factors alter MCT in vivo. Aim 3. What factors alter MCT in CF? To identify factors that disrupt MCT we developed a novel ex vivo approach using freshly excised airways. Our intriguing preliminary data reveal that CF disrupts release of mucus from the airway surface. Our working hypothesis is that a reduced pH and/or HCO3"" concentration in airway surface liquid impair the normal behavior of airway mucus.","Adult;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Behavior;Bicarbonates;Biological Assay;Birth;Bronchiectasis;Chest;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Educational process of instructing;Employee Strikes;Excision;Family suidae;Functional disorder;Gland;Goals;Heterogeneity;Host Defense;Human;Infection;Inflammation;Instruction;Intestines;Killings;Knowledge;Learning;Lung;Modeling;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mus;Newborn Infant;Obstruction;Particulate;Pathogenesis;Pattern;Physicians;Physiology;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Research;Scientist;Surface;System;Testing;Time;Time Factors;Virus Diseases;Work;airway surface liquid;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis mouse;cystic fibrosis patients;early cystic fibrosis;human disease;in vivo;infancy;insight;neonate;novel;novel therapeutics;particle;pathogen;prevent;screening","Mucociliary transport in early cystic fibrosis lung disease","RELEVANCE (See instructions): This research will allow us to better understand how CF disrupts the MCT defense system at the commencement of disease teach us how it changes as disease progresses and identify factors that cause abnormalities.

"No NIH Category available","Twenty-three years after identification of the CFTR gene controversies still surround the pathogenesis of airways disease we lack answers to many crucial questions current treatments are inadequate and cystic fibrosis (CF) remains a life shortening and too often lethal disease. A major impediment to progress has been lack of a CF animal model other than the mouse. CF mice fail to develop lung disease the cause of most CF morbidity and mortality. We have now developed pigs with targeted alterations of the CFTR gene. CF pigs spontaneously develop the hallmark features of CF lung disease including airway infection inflammation airway wall remodeling mucus accumulation and airway obstruction. Within hours of birth CF pigs fail to eradicate bacteria as effectively as wild-type pigs. In this Program three senior and highly accomplished investigators will seize the unique opportunity to use CF pigs to answer key questions about CF lung disease. Together the three projects will discover how loss of CFTR function affects: a) mucociliary transport; b) the response of airways to viral infection; c) HCO3- secretion and control of airway surface liquid pH; and d) bacterial killing on the airway surface. The Project Leaders have an outstanding track record of collaboration in CF and here they sharpen their focus to a common goal. Their research is highly creative and is supported by five cores that provide innovative services and infrastructure. Discoveries from this PPG will accelerate development of novel therapies for patients who suffer from this devastating disease.","Address;Affect;Airway Obstruction;Animal Model;Animals;Anions;Area;Bacteria;Bicarbonates;Biliary cirrhosis;Biology;Birth;Bypass;Clinical;Collaborations;Complementary DNA;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Defect;Development;Disease;Epithelial;Exocrine pancreas;Family suidae;Functional disorder;Gall Bladder Diseases;Genes;Gland;Goals;Host Defense;Hour;Ileostomy;Ileus;Infection;Inflammation;Intervention;Intestines;Killings;Learning;Life;Lung;Lung diseases;Meconium;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mucociliary Clearance;Mucous body substance;Mus;Newborn Infant;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathogenesis;Patients;Penetrance;Physiology;Prevention;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Services;Sinus;Surface;System;Time;Tissues;Transgenes;Viral Respiratory Tract Infection;Virus Diseases;Writing;airway inflammation;airway remodeling;airway surface liquid;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis mouse;fatty acid-binding proteins;improved;innovation;interdisciplinary approach;intestinal fatty acid binding protein;mortality;novel;novel therapeutics;prevent;programs;promoter;response;somatic cell nuclear transfer","PPG - Airway Physiology and Pathophysiology in a Porcine CF Model","The three projects will discover how loss of CFTR function affects: a) mucociliary transport; b) the response of airways to viral infection; c) HCOa' secretion and control of airway surface liquid pH; and d) bacterial killing on the airway surface.","NHLBI","9113630","6/30/2016","PAR-10-285","4P01HL091842-09","4","P01","HL","091842","09","","SHERIDAN, JOHN T","9/1/2008","6/30/2018","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]"," ","7772015","WELSH, MICHAEL J.","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," ","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","2295186"," ","NHLBI","1525444","769742"," ","2295186",

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The biosynthesis of thymine (a DNA base) is essential in all organisms. The last step in this biosynthesis in humans and other eukaryotes is catalyzed by thyA/TYMS-encoded thymidylate synthase (TSase) and its cofactor is recycled by the folA-encoded dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In several human pathogens e.g. those causing anthrax tuberculosis typhus and more the thyX-encoded flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS) provides an alternative biosynthetic path to thymine. At first glance FDTS seems merely to combine the activities of TSase and DHFR; it has same reactants and products as bi-functional TSase-DHFR. However FDTS has very different genetic structural and mechanistic properties than its human counterparts. The catalytic mechanism of FDTSs is not understood; they have no known potent inhibitors; and inhibitors of classical TSases or DHFRs do not efficiently inhibit FDTSs. Were their mechanism known rational inhibitor design could lead to new classes of antibiotic drugs with the potential for low toxicity. This proposal aims at studies of the chemical mechanism of FDTS catalysis. This study is of broader interest as preliminary studies suggested that FDTS chemical mechanism is different from that of either bifunctional TSase- DHFRs or any other known mechanism of nucleotide methylation. The proposed studies will employ a broad arsenal of methodologies including isotopic labeling single-turnover trapping of reaction intermediates pre- steady-state and steady-state enzyme kinetics time-resolved ESI-MS mutagenesis alternative cofactors X-ray crystallography and the synthesis and testing of putative intermediates. The findings from these diverse mechanistic studies present will test various proposed mechanisms and will illuminate the enigmatic mechanism of this enzyme.

"Cancer","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Distant metastasis in cancer patients results from cancer cells escape from a primary tumor and travel through the bloodstream to secondary organ sites. Little is known about how this journey affects the biology of these circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Within the bloodstream CTCs are exposed to hemodynamic forces which are foreign to cancer cells derived from epithelial organs. It has recently been shown that cancer cell lines from numerous epithelial tissues exhibit an acquired resistance to brief pulses of high level fluid shear stress (FSS) compared to normal or benign epithelial cells. This phenotype reflects signaling through at least several common oncogenic pathways. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying FSS-resistance in cancer cells and to gain a greater understanding of how CTCs experience FSS in circulation using a model of the human heart and measuring FSS-resistance in CTCs from a mouse model of prostate cancer metastasis. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cancer cells in the circulation are exposed to brief pulses of high-level FSS that trigger membrane-cytoskeletal changes which confer resistance to FSS. The rationale for the proposed research is that it will for the first tim elucidate how cancer cells respond to FSS and how this relates to the ability of CTCs to survive hemodynamic forces. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Determine the mechanisms underlying FSS resistance in cancer cells. Based on our preliminary data our working hypothesis is that exposure to FSS induces calcium entry through damaged plasma membrane. This triggers plasma membrane repair as well as Rho-dependent modulation of the actin cytoskeleton which renders cells resistant to subsequent exposure to FSS; and 2) Measure the effects of physiologic FSS on cancer cells. Based on our observations on the effects of brief pulses of high level FSS on cancer cells our working hypothesis is that CTCs also experience these forces in physiologic settings and exhibit FSS resistance. We will employ a device that accurately models the human heart to determine if exposure to brief pulses of high-level shear stress triggers FSS resistance in cancer cells and we will measure FSS resistance in CTCs in blood samples from mice. The contribution of this proposal will be significant because it will begin to elucidate the mechanisms for how cancer cells respond to fluid shear stress and to determine if CTCs exhibit FSS resistance under physiological settings. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying FSS-resistance may have implications for diagnostic approaches for instance by using FSS as a means to distinguish benign from malignant cells. Likewise these studies may inform therapeutic approaches to reduce metastatic potential by interfering with FSS-resistance. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it challenges the commonly held idea that CTCs are intrinsically fragile and highly subject to destruction from hemodynamic shear forces and technically innovative because we will use a device that recapitulates physiologic shear stress in the human heart to explore the effects of FSS in cancer cells.      ","Actins;Affect;Attention;Automobile Driving;Benign;Biological;Biology;Biomechanics;Biomedical Engineering;Blood Cells;Blood Circulation;Blood specimen;Calcium;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell membrane;Cells;Cellular biology;Characteristics;Clinical;Cytoskeleton;Data;Devices;Diagnostic;Disease Progression;Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm;Distant;Distant Metastasis;Environment;Epithelial;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Exposure to;Goals;Heart;Hematogenous;Human;Light;Liquid substance;Long-Term Effects;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Measures;Membrane;Metastatic Prostate Cancer;Mission;Modeling;Mus;Neoplasm Circulating Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oncogenic;Organ;Outcomes Research;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiologic pulse;Physiological;Play;Primary Neoplasm;Property;Research;Resistance;Role;Secondary to;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Travel;Work;base;cancer cell;cancer type;cell transformation;cell type;clinically significant;experience;extracellular;hemodynamics;in vivo;innovation;millisecond;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;public health relevance;repaired;response;rho;shear stress;tumor;tumor microenvironment;uptake","Effects of fluid shear stress on circulating tumor cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NCI because it seeks to discover basic mechanisms underlying how metastatic cancer cells experience and respond to hemodynamic shear stress while they are in the circulation.

"Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Pediatric; Prevention; Rural Health","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): National health reforms relating to the Affordable Care Act have devoted little attention to oral health despite the importance of oral health to overall health particularly for children and younger adults. A key factor in improving oral healthis expanding access to preventive and curative dental care. Expanding access to care often occurs through increased access to dental insurance coverage. Despite limited attention one of the early policy changes due to the Affordable Care Act has had a spillover effect on dental insurance coverage. The dependent coverage mandate requiring private health insurance plans to allow dependents up to the age of 26 to remain on parental health insurance plans has resulted in young adults gaining access to private dental coverage as well. Coverage rates have increased by as much as 6-7 percentage points providing dental coverage to nearly 2 million young adults nationwide. This national expansion of private dental insurance provides a unique and unprecedented opportunity of a natural experiment to study the effects of a policy-driven expansion in dental insurance on preventive and curative dental services utilization and dental spending. Previous studies that have contributed to the topic of dental insurance and dental services use have typically focused on public coverage or have suffered from confounding that detracts from the ability to understand the casual effects of dental insurance rather than differences in socioeconomic or demographic traits. In contrast the private expansion of dental insurance resulting from the dependent coverage mandate was specific to a select group of young adults and took effect in late 2010. In combination these factors allow for an analysis of dental coverage that can uncover the causal effects of coverage on dental services utilization and overall spending. The proposed study will identify the impacts of the ACA-driven expansion in private dental coverage on utilization of preventive and curative dental services as well as dental spending among young adults. This study is highly innovative as it takes advantage of nationwide expansion of private dental coverage a natural experiment that can contribute important knowledge about potential future policies directed at increasing dental insurance coverage and the implications for access to dental care. We plan to evaluate preventive curative and emergency room dental visits to provide a comprehensive assessment of the effects of the ACA policy and the resulting private dental coverage expansion on dental services utilization and evaluate potential heterogeneity by race/ethnicity income levels and rural/urban status. We will use a nationally representative dataset to accomplish the proposed Specific Aims.      ","Academic achievement;Accident and Emergency department;Address;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Affordable Care Act;Age;Attention;Child;Chronic;Control Groups;Data;Data Set;Dental;Dental Care;Dental Insurance;Dental caries;Dentists;Diabetes Mellitus;Emergency Care;Ethnic Origin;Expenditure;Future;Goals;Health;Health Care Reform;Health Insurance;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare Systems;Heart Diseases;Heterogeneity;Income;Individual;Insurance Carriers;Insurance Coverage;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Life;Link;Medical;National Health Interview Survey;Natural experiment;Oral health;Parents;Periodontal Diseases;Persons;Policies;Population;Preventive;Public Policy;Race;Recording of previous events;Research;Risk;Rural;Services;Surveys;Tooth Diseases;Tooth Loss;United States National Institutes of Health;Visit;age group;aged;design;improved;innovation;interest;permanent tooth;prevent;psychosocial;public health relevance;service utilization;socioeconomics;tooth filling;trait;young adult","National Expansion of Dental Insurance Among Young Adults: A Natural Experiment","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): This study will evaluate the effects of a national expansion of private dental insurance among young adults on utilization of preventive and curative dental services as well as effects on dental spending.

"Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diabetes; Physical Activity; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with type two diabetes (T2D) frequently lead sedentary life styles which are not only a risk factor for diabetes but can also exacerbate the disease. Recommending increased physical activity is therefore a cornerstone of T2D prevention and management. Historically increasing activity was synonymous with exercise; however we now know that even much more modest activity levels (e.g. simply walking) or merely decreasing the proportion of sedentary time may be sufficient to improve health outcomes. Some interventions designed to increase activity have shown promise; others have been less successful. The availability of inexpensive pedometers and more recently low cost triaxial accelerometers has now made it much easier to monitor activity levels and provide feedback to users. These devices are ideal for capturing activity associated with walking the most popular and acceptable form of exercise for patients with T2D but only if patients actually wear them. Thus there is a need to develop pragmatic approaches that encourage patients to not only wear these monitoring devices but also to motivate them to increase their activity. The overarching goal is of this proposal is to develop new practical affordable and easy-to-use approaches to increase activity among patients at risk for developing T2D and those already diagnosed with T2D. To achieve this goal we will test MapTrek an m-health game or our own design that uses low cost triaxial accelerometers to encourage patients to walk more and we will test this m-health intervention against a control group using the accelerometers alone. The data we generate will help inform a larger pragmatic trial to investigate long-term clinical outcomes and costs.      ","Accelerometer;Car Phone;Clinical;Control Groups;Data;Devices;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Disease;Effectiveness;Effectiveness of Interventions;Environment;Equipment;Exercise;Feedback;Future;Goals;Health;Incentives;Interdisciplinary Study;Intervention;Lead;Life;Location;Maps;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Outcome;Participant;Patients;Performance;Physical activity;Populations at Risk;Prevention;Randomized;Rewards;Risk;Risk Factors;Structure;Testing;Time;Update;Walking;Work;base;behavior change;cohort;cost;design;exercise program;fitbit;improved;interest;mHealth;monitoring device;mortality;peer support;pragmatic trial;prototype;public health relevance;sedentary;sedentary lifestyle;social;therapy design;tool;virtual;walking speed;web app","An mHealth Intervention to Increase Activity Among Patients at Risk for Type 2 Diabetes","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Exercise is a cornerstone in the treatment and prevention of type two diabetes (T2D) but encouraging people with T2D and at risk for T2D to not only start an exercise program but sustain one has been challenging.

"Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Neurosciences","Oxidative stress is a major cause of autonomic dysregulation increased blood pressure (BP) and end-organdamage in hypertension. Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) is a unique anfioxidant that enables redoxsignaling and protects against oxidative damage by selectively reversing oxidation of methionine residues inproteins. We reasoned that the targeted prevention of methionine oxidation might yield a phenotypedistinctively different than the general antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalase and glutathioneperoxidase (GPx). In preliminary experiments we found that MsrA-/- mice exhibit autonomic dysregulafionincreased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) hypertension and aortic aneurysm formation. These phenotypeshave not been observed in mice deficient in SOD or GPx. While protecfive actions of MsrA have beendemonstrated in aging neurodegeneration and myocardial ischemia/infarcfion its roles in autonomicregulation hypertension and vascular damage have not been invesfigated. We hypothesize that: 1) MsrA isrequired for normal autonomic and BP regulation and protects against angiotensin II (Ang ll)-inducedhypertension and end-organ damage via actions at both the end-organ and the brain to reduce SNA; and 2)the mechanisms include inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. Project aims are to: (1) Determinecardiovascular autonomic and end-organ phenotypes in global MsrA knockout transgenic and control micebefore and during systemic infusion of Ang-ll; (2) Deflne the roles of targeted MsrA expression and deletionin nervous system vs. vascular muscle; and (3) Determine the CNS contributions of oxidative stressinflammation and the renin-angiotensin system to increased SNA hypertension and end-organ damage inMsrR-/- mice. Cardiovascular and autonomic phenotypes will be fully characterized. Inflammation oxidativestress cytokines and associated expression of pro- and antioxidant genes will be measured in heart aortaand speciflc brain sites. MsrA expression will be modifled in a tissue- and site-speciflc manner using genetargeting and viral-mediated gene transfer of MsrA and siRNA-MsrA. Central mechanisms will be evaluatedby measuring responses to intracerebroventricular infusions ofthe antioxidant tempol the ATi receptorblocker losartan and the sympatho-inhibitory drug rilmenidine. The signiflcance ofthis speciflc methioninereductase as a novel protective regulator of autonomic activity and end-organ integrity relates to its potentialas a therapeutic target for treatment of hypertension.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Oxidative stress contributes to many age-related diseases including hypertension.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Hypertension; Neurosciences","Background. The proposed research addresses the important concept that inflammation and immunity playan important role in hypertension. Two recent observations provide the background for our proposal. Oneis the flnding that the vagus exerts an anti-inflammatory influence on the immune system by activating a-7nicotinic cholinergic receptors. The other is the essential contribution of the adaptive immune system and Tlymphocytes to chronic angiotensin II dependent hypertension. Our focus is on the role ofthe innate immunesystem in a genetic model of hypertension the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Our early resultsrecentiy published in Circulation Research indicate that nicotine exerts an anti-inflammatory influence onsplenocytes of Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats in contrast to a marked proinflammatory response seen in spleno-cytes of SHR prior to the onset of hypertension.Hypothesis. The innate immune system in genetic hypertension is abnormally regulated by the autonomicnervous system to trigger proinflammatory responses to endogenous antigens. These induce pathologicrenal and vascular changes that initiate and sustain the hypertensive state.Experimental Plan. The intracellular toll-like receptors (TLR) 7/8 and 9 will be activated with speciflc ligandsto induce cytokine release and upregulate proinflammatory genes in isolated splenocytes and in vivo. Re-sponses will be obtained prenatally and at various ages in WKY and in SHR as hypertension develops andprogresses. Regulation of TLR-induced inflammatory responses by activation of nicotinic cholinergic or AngII ATI receptors will conflrm the importance of neurohormonal receptors on the innate immune system andhence on the hypertensive state. The phenotypic expression of hypertension and end-organ renal and vas-cular damage will be correlated with the gene and protein expressions in those tissues and their inflltrationwith immune cells. We will attempt to induce hypertension in WKY by prolonged activation of TLRs and inFl hybrids (SHR-WKY) by adoptive transfer of splenocytes and bone marrow from SHR. The importanceof TLR activation and the regulatory influence of nicotinic cholinergic or ATI receptors will be tested in themouse model of chronic ang ll-induced hypertension.Anticipated results. The results will establish the importance of innate immune system in triggering theinflammatory cascade that leads to hypertension. The regulatory influence of nicotinic and ATI receptorsdeflne a new and important putative therapeutic intervention in hypertension and cardiovascular disease.RELEVANCE (See instructions):Relevance. A novel concept deflnes the importance of the.innate immune system in initiating theinflammatory cascade in hypertension. The correlation between the expression of proinflammatory genesand end-organ damage establishes pathological relevance and raises the hopeful prospect of putativetherapeutic interventions.","Accounting;Address;Adoptive Transfer;Age;Agonist;Angiotensin II;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antigens;Autonomic nervous system;Bacteriophages;Blood Circulation;Blood Pressure;Blood Vessels;Bone Marrow;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Cells;Cholinergic Receptors;Chronic;Dendritic Cells;Development;Dexamethasone;Flow Cytometry;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Models;Glucocorticoid Receptor;Hybrids;Hypertension;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Inbred SHR Rats;Inbred WKY Rats;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Infusion procedures;Instruction;Interleukin-6;Kidney;Ligands;Maintenance;Marrow;Measurement;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mesentery;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mus;NF-kappa B;Natural Immunity;Natural Killer Cells;Nature;Neurobiology;Nicotine;Organ;Pathologic;Phenotype;Play;Population;Process;Publishing;Rattus;Receptor Activation;Regulation;Research;Role;Serum;Spleen;Splenocyte;Staging;T-Lymphocyte;TLR7 gene;TNF gene;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Tissues;Toll-like receptors;Transcription Factor AP-1;Transgenic Organisms;cholinergic;cytokine;familial hypertension;gene induction;in utero;in vivo;kidney vascular structure;mouse model;novel;overexpression;protein expression;receptor;research study;response","Neurohormonal Regulation of the Innate Immune System is Proinflammatory in a Gen","n/a","NHLBI","9111045","5/4/2016","PAR-10-285","5P01HL014388-43","5","P01","HL","014388","43","","MARIC-BILKAN, CHRISTINE "," "," ","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]","6588","1864622","ABBOUD, FRANCOIS M","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2016","5/31/2017"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016"," ","588900"," ","390000","198900"," "," ",
"Anxiety Disorders; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Prevention","Anxiety is the most common psychiatric disorder. Anxiety is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events independent of conventional risk factors. However the mechanisms underiying this link are unknown and it has never been proved that treating anxiety reduces cardiovascular risk. This project will address these important issues. We have gathered compelling data demonstrating that even modest anxiety symptoms are associated with sympathetic nerve activation inflammation and profound impairment of resistance vessel function in humans. Using a multidisciplinary approach we will address three speciflc aims: 1) Does anxietv produce vascular dvsfunction through increased inflammation or oxidant stress? We will measure ex vivo endothelial cell proteins reflecting inflammation and oxidant stress in subjects with anxiety symptom scores in the highest and lowest quartiles. We will then test whether anti-inflammatory (salsalate) and anti-oxidant (ascorbic acid) interventions reverse vascular dysfunction in high compared to low anxiety subjects. This aim will additionally examine whether peripheral resistance vessel dysfunction is also present in the brain using functional MRI to measure cerebral blood flow and whether this is improved by salsalate. 2) Does anxietv produce vascular dysfunction through svmpathetic activation? We will test whether sympathetic inhibition with clonidine for 4 weeks improves inflammation oxidant stress and vascular dysfunction to a greater degree in high than low anxiety subjects. 3) Does treatment of anxietv improve svmpathetic activation inflammation oxidant stress and Vascular dvsfunction? We will randomly assign subjects with high anxiety to a novel mindfulness-based acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) or time control. This therapy has been shown in our hands and others to have substantial and durable effects on anxiety symptoms. We will test whether ACT produces signiflcantly greater improvements in microneurographic sympathetic nerve activity endothelial cell proteins reflecting inflammation and oxidant stress and forearm resistance vessel function. This project should: A) Provide compelling evidence that anxiety causes vascular damage. B) Elucidate mechanisms involved in the effects of anxiety on the vasculature. C) Help develop novel phenotypes for future research on anxiety classiflcation severity and treatment. D) Suggest new strategies for cardiovascular risk stratiflcation and prevention. We will achieve these goals through a distinctive multidisciplinary collaboration between investigators expert in cardiovascular biology psychiatry behavioral psychology and neuroimaging.","Acetylcholine;Address;Adult;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antioxidants;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Area;Ascorbic Acid;Behavioral;Biological Markers;Biology;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cardiovascular system;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Clonidine;Data;Diagnosis;Dilatation - action;Dilator;Endothelial Cells;Etiology;Event;Forearm;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Future;Generalized Anxiety Disorder;Goals;Human;Impairment;Inflammation;Interdisciplinary Study;Internal Medicine;Intervention;Lead;Link;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Major Depressive Disorder;Measures;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Muscle;Myocardial Infarction;Nerve;Nervous System Physiology;Neurobiology;Organ;Oxidative Stress;Patients;Peripheral Resistance;Phenotype;Physicians;Physiological;Physiology;Population;Prevention;Primary Health Care;Proteins;Provider;Psyche structure;Psychiatric Diagnosis;Psychiatry;Psychologist;Psychology;Randomized;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Rest;Risk;Risk Factors;Risk Reduction;Scientist;Serum;Severities;Stratification;Stress;Sympathetic Nervous System;Testing;Time;Vascular Diseases;anxiety symptoms;anxiety treatment;base;cardiovascular risk factor;human subject;improved;interdisciplinary approach;interdisciplinary collaboration;mindfulness;neuroimaging;neurovascular;novel;oxidant stress;salicylsalicylic acid;stroke;trafficking;white matter","Does Anxiety Cause Vascular Dysfunction Through Inflammation and Sns Activation?","Anxiety is a psychiatric condition found in about 20% ofthe US population which has been linked to increased risk for heart attack and stroke.

"Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Neurosciences","One-third of individuals over the age of 20 in the United States have hypertension. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. The estimated burden of the effects of hypertension in the U.S. during 2010 was estimated to be $93.5 billion due to health care costs and missed work. The causes of the onset and the progressive increase in blood pressure over time are not known for most cases of hypertension. In recent studies in rats we have discovered that initial challenges with low non-pressor doses of either angiotensin II or aldosterone wilf sensitize the pressor response to subsequent hypertension-inducing stimuli. Additional evidence indicates that these sensitized pressorresponses are a result of sustained changes in the central nervous system. Similar types of neuroplasticity have been observed and studied in neural networks controlling many behavioral and physiological response systems. However as of the present time there has been little appreciation of the role that changes in information processing in the nervous system as a result of experience-induced sensitization may have in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Therefore the principal hypothesis to be tested in this proposal is that physiological and environmental challenges act to sensitize the pressor response to hypertension-inducing stimuli by inducing neuroplasticity within specific components of the brain's neural network controlling blood pressure. An important corollary of this hypothesis to be tested inthat components of the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system act in conjunction with other neuroplasticity-associated signaling systems to produce long-term modifications of the brain and a sensitized hypertensive response. To address an evaluation of these hypotheses three specific aims will be pursued that will employ functional cellular and molecular methodologies to analyze where in thecentral nervous system and in what cell types neuroplasticity occurs to effect sensitization of hypertension. The results of these studies will provide important new information and insights into the pathogenesis of high blood pressure.RELEVANCE (See Instructions): The nervous system plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and has the capacity to adjust cardiovascular function over the course of time through the processes involving neuroplasticity. Understanding how physiological or exogenous stimuli present earlier in life can modify brain function to produce a predisposition for an enhanced hypertension to a subsequent cardiovascular challenge is likely to identify targets and strategies for intervening in the pathogenesis of high blood pressure.","Absenteeism at work;Address;Age;Agonist;Aldosterone;Angiotensin II;Angiotensins;Behavioral;Biological Neural Networks;Blood Pressure;Brain;Brain region;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cardiovascular system;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Collection;Coronary heart disease;Dietary Sodium;Dose;Drug Tolerance;Evaluation;Exposure to;Glutamates;Health Care Costs;Heart Diseases;Housing;Hypertension;Individual;Instruction;Laboratories;Lead;Learning;Life;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Memory;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;Nervous system structure;Neuraxis;Neurobiology;Neuromodulator;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Pain;Pathogenesis;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Play;Predisposition;Process;Rattus;Regulation;Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Stimulus;Subfornical Organ;System;Testing;Time;Tropomyosin;United States;blood pressure regulation;cell type;experience;information processing;insight;mind control;mortality;paraventricular nucleus;preoptic nucleus;prevent;receptor;research study;response;reverse tolerance;stressor;stroke","Sites and Mechanisms of CNS Neuroplasticity in the Sensitization of Hypertension","n/a","NHLBI","9111043","5/4/2016","PAR-10-285","5P01HL014388-43","5","P01","HL","014388","43","","MARIC-BILKAN, CHRISTINE "," "," ","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]","6586","1858879","JOHNSON, ALAN KIM","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2016","5/31/2017"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016"," ","362400"," ","240000","122400"," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant): This Program Project Grant continues to focus on Integrative Neurobiology of Cardiovascular Regulation. Now in its 40th year it represents a major scientific emphasis of the Cardiovascular Research Center at lowa. The strength of this renewal is based on the cohesion and synergy of its senior leadership its constant evolution in concepts and approaches with new investigators and the continuum of the effort from discovery of mechanisms to their translation into disease states in animal models and humans. The four projects represent a functional integration of central neurohormonal processes which through interdependent molecular mechanisms involving neuroplasticity oxidation and inflammation induce pathological states of anxiety hypertension and vascular damage.

"Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes; Lung; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disorder in Caucasian populations and is caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel. CF is a multi-organ disease affecting the lung pancreas liver intestine and gallbladder. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common significant complication of CF and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. CFRD which is pathophysiologically distinct from type 1 and type 2 diabetes significantly worsens the nutritional and pulmonary health of CF patients. Glycemic abnormalities are common in children with CF and the 13% of CF children 6-10 years of age that have abnormal glycemic status are at extraordinarily high risk for developing diabetes within the next few years.Our studies in CF ferrets and children 3 months to 5 years of age suggest that the underpinnings of CFRD occur very early in life. Of 12 CF subjects who were 1-5 years of age and have at least one F508 allele 42% demonstrated abnormal glucose tolerance. This high incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance in young CF children as compared to slightly older children (13% at 6-10 years of age) is consistent with our discovery that in CF ferrets glucose intolerance develops in phases (with intervening periods of temporary recovery) that are associated with changes in the regulation of insular axis hormones and fibrotic remodeling of the pancreas. A major goal of this R24 is to identify the early pathophysiologic events involved in CF pancreas remodeling and the development of CFRD. The observed disturbances in insular and entero-insular axis hormones in young CF children are consistent with the hypothesis that both positive and negative adaptive changes influence insulin regulation and potentially insulin action. Similar age-dependent alterations occur in CF ferrets and will enable us to dissect the mechanisms that underlie these processes. Studies in isolated human ferret and pig islets have demonstrated that CFTR impacts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by islets through its activity in either endocrine cells or islet-associated ductal cells. The propose research will identify pancreas-intrinsic and -extrinsic events that alter insulin secretion and glycemic status in CF with a focus on defining (i) the islet-intrinsic mechanisms that control CFTR-dependent insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo (ii) the pancreas-extrinsic mechanisms that lead to abnormal insulin secretion and altered glucose physiology in CF and (iii) the extent to which endocrine pancreas remodeling contributes to subsequent abnormalities in insulin secretion and whether amelioration of the primary wave of pancreas inflammation in CF can prevent maladaptive islet remodeling. These studies are expected to identify early blood biomarkers of CFRD risk as well as methods for early intervention.","10 year old;5 year old;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Age;Alleles;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Appearance;Arginine;Beta Cell;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Birth;Blood;Caucasians;Cell physiology;Cells;Child;Chloride Channels;Clinical;Clinical Research;Comorbidity;Complication;Coupled;Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors;Cystic Fibrosis;Data;Defect;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Dose;Ductal Epithelial Cell;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Early treatment;Endocrine;Euglycemic Clamping;Event;Exocrine pancreas;Family suidae;Ferrets;Functional disorder;Gallbladder;Glucose;Glucose Clamp;Glucose Intolerance;Goals;Health;Hepatic;Hereditary Disease;Hormonal;Hormones;Human;Hyperglycemia;Hypoglycemia;Ibuprofen;Image;Impairment;In Vitro;Incidence;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Insulin;Interleukin-6;Intestines;Islet Cell;Islets of Langerhans;Lead;Life;Liver;Lung;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibody R24;Morbidity - disease rate;Neonatal;Newborn Infant;Nutritional;OGTT;Organ;PET/CT scan;Pancreas;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Phase;Physiology;Play;Population;Prevention;Process;Recovery;Regulation;Research;Respiratory physiology;Role;Salicylic Acids;Secondary to;Testing;Toddler;Work;age related;autocrine;cell type;children with cystic fibrosis;clinical Diagnosis;clinical care;cohort;cystic fibrosis patients;defined contribution;diabetes risk;early cystic fibrosis;fluorodeoxyglucose;glucose disposal;glucose production;glucose tolerance;high risk;hormone regulation;impaired glucose tolerance;improved;in vivo;insulin secretion;insulin sensitivity;islet;knock-down;mortality;paracrine;prevent;single molecule;small hairpin RNA;stellate cell;type I and type II diabetes;vector","Early Pathogenesis of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive condition among Caucasians with over $450 million dollars spent annually on clinical care of CF patients in the U.S. alone.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sorting membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles that form within late endosomes is a fundamental process that regulates many biological pathways that rely on maintaining appropriate levels of a given set of cell surface membrane proteins. This is the pathway that guides the delivery and degradation of proteins in lysosomes. This pathway is driven by ubiquitin which works as a sorting signal when attached to membrane protein cargo. This process controls the degradation of almost all cell surface membrane proteins and understanding this degradative process is significant since it impacts a wide array of normal and pathogenic processes that rely on proper activity of particular membrane proteins such as transporters and signaling receptors at the cell surface. The long-term goal of the competitive renewal proposal is to understand how this ubiquitin-dependent sorting pathway is controlled and will lead to insights into how disease states such as cancer might be achieved when this process goes awry. To accomplish this we have devised aims to 1) discover how the major family of Nedd4- related ubiquitin ligases are programed to target different cell surface membrane proteins; 2) discover how ubiquitinated membrane proteins are recognized by the endosomal sorting machinery and how that cargo plays an active role in organizing the sorting apparatus itself; and 3) discover new proteins that participate in the process of intralumenal vesicle formation using a series of genetic screens.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Binding;Binding Sites;Biogenesis;Biological;C-terminal;Cell Surface Proteins;Cell physiology;Cell surface;Complex;Couples;Data;Defect;Deubiquitination;Differentiation and Growth;Disease;Endosomes;Ensure;Family;Family member;Foundations;Genetic Screening;Goals;Health;Heart;Human;Hydrolase;Lead;Life;Ligase;Lipids;Lysosomes;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Mission;Modeling;Multivesicular Body;N-terminal;Nutrient;Pathway interactions;Play;Prevention;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Receptor Signaling;Recruitment Activity;Research;Role;Series;Signal Transduction;Site;Sorting - Cell Movement;Testing;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;United States National Institutes of Health;Vesicle;Work;Yeasts;base;disease diagnosis;endosome membrane;in vivo;insight;late endosome;member;mutant;neurotransmission;novel;programs;protein complex;protein degradation;receptor;ubiquitin ligase;uptake","Ubiquitin-dependent sorting in endosomes and the TGN","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on how multiple cellular functions are regulated through the degradation of cell surface proteins that mediate growth differentiation signal- transduction neuronal signaling and nutrient uptake.

"Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insulin resistance is a major contributor to the epidemic of metabolic diseases including dyslipidemia hypertension and type 2 diabetes. According to the CDC approximately 10% of U.S. adults have diabetes now and 33% are expected to have diabetes by 2050. Therefore there is a serious demand for the development of new therapeutics to increase insulin sensitivity. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone that is a potent insulin sensitizer. Unlike other insulin sensitizers that indirectly improve insulin sensitivity by reducing ectopic lipid accumulation FGF21 has the unique ability to directly enhance insulin sensitivity. We recently demonstrated that circulating FGF21 levels are produced from the liver during overfeeding and function to enhance insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in brown adipose tissue (BAT). The aims of this grant are to 1) determine the contribution of FGF21 action on BAT to the insulin-sensitizing effects of FGF21 and 2) determine the mechanism by which FGF21 enhances insulin sensitivity in brown adipocytes. To accomplish these aims we propose several experimental approaches. In specific aim 1 we will utilize novel animal models to inactivate reactivate or constitutively activate FGF21 signaling to specific adipose depots in vivo to access tissue-specific effects on insulin sensitivity. In specific aim 2 we will examine the mechanism whereby FGF21 enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in brown adipocytes. In addition we will evaluate the contribution of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in BAT to the glucose lowering effects of FGF21 in vivo. These studies are significant because they will provide new information on the mechanism of FGF21 action and also provide fundamental insight into the mechanisms regulating whole-body glucose homeostasis.","Address;Adipocytes;Adipose tissue;Adult;Animal Model;Biochemistry;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brown Fat;Cell membrane;Cellular biology;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Dose;Dyslipidemias;Endocrine;Energy Metabolism;Epidemic;Functional disorder;GLUT4 gene;Glucose;Goals;Grant;Health;Homeostasis;Hormones;Hour;Human;Hypertension;Insulin;Insulin Resistance;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Lipids;Liver;Maintenance;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Metabolism;Molecular;Neck;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obese Mice;Obesity;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Physiological;Physiology;Plasma;Proteins;Publishing;Recombinant Fibroblast Growth Factor;Regulation;Research;Signal Transduction;Site;Skeletal Muscle;Spinal Cord;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;analog;atypical protein kinase C;base;blood glucose regulation;carbohydrate metabolism;clavicle;fasting glucose;fibroblast growth factor 21;glucose disposal;glucose metabolism;glucose transport;glucose uptake;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;insulin sensitivity;insulin sensitizing drugs;liver function;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutics;oxidation;protein kinase C zeta;receptor;receptor expression;tissue processing;trafficking","Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism by FGF21 Action on Brown Adipose Tissue","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone produced by the liver to regulate metabolic homeostasis.

"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the use of vaccines to combat infectious diseases has greatly improved human health they are poorly immunogenic and requires multiple doses for protection. As such vaccines are co-administered with an adjuvant to enhance immunity. Numerous classes of vaccine adjuvants have been developed and showed the desired immune response over the past several decades. Unfortunately only a few adjuvants are considered to be sufficiently potent and clinically liable for use in humans. Alum amixture of aluminum hydroxide and phosphate salts remains the dominant adjuvant with extensive safety record approved for use in human vaccination.  In efforts to discover new adjuvants an unusual class of carbohydrates zwitterionic polysaccharides (ZPSs) containing both negative and positive charge motifs in their repeating units were found to activate CD4+ T-cell-dependent immune responses and modulate host cytokine responses to bacterial infection. ZPSs when co-administered with antigen tetanus toxoid increase the specific antibody tier illustrating their capacity to serve as potential vaccine adjuvants in vivo. One of the best characterized ZPSs is zwitterionic polysaccharide PS A1 isolated from capsular Bacteroides fragilis. Studies showed that glycoconjugates generated from conjugation of PS A1 to tumor-associated mucin antigen TN elicits high titer antibodies that are specific and selective for the TN hapten.  Despite the promise of PS A1 as a potential adjuvant obtaining it from natural sources is a complicated process of extraction and purification that results in the production of minute relatively impure quantities and could alter its structure. Since FDA has strict regulation regarding the purity and quality of vaccine adjuvants for use in humans a synthetic source must be developed for PS A1 to be utilized as a clinically relevant adjuvant. The main goal of this proposal will address these challenges through the chemical synthesis of natural and non-natural PS A1 oligosaccharides with defined repeating units utilizing our recently developed nickel-catalyzed -glycosylation methodologies. This proposed effort will deliver defined PS A1 molecules in high purity without batch-to-batch variation and provide tools for studying their roles as adjuvants and exploring structure-relationship activity (SAR) studies. 1      ","Address;Adjuvant;Aluminum Hydroxide;Antibodies;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antigens;Bacterial Infections;Bacteroides fragilis;Binding;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Carbohydrates;Charge;Chemistry;Circular Dichroism;Clinical;Communicable Diseases;Development;Dose;Evaluation;Event;Galactose;Generations;Glycoconjugates;Goals;Haptens;Health;Human;Immune response;Immunity;Immunologic Adjuvants;Immunology;Iowa;Isomerism;Methodology;Microbiology;Molecular Conformation;Mus;Nickel;Oligosaccharides;Organic solvent product;Polysaccharides;Process;Production;Regulation;Research Personnel;Role;Safety;Salts;Signal Transduction;Source;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Tetanus Toxoid;Toxic effect;Tumor-Associated Carbohydrate Antigens;Universities;Vaccination;Vaccine Adjuvant;Vaccines;Variant;aluminum phosphate;aluminum sulfate;analog;base;biphenyl hydrolase-related protein;chemical synthesis;clinically relevant;combat;cytokine;glycosylation;immune function;immunogenic;immunogenicity;improved;in vivo;mouse model;novel vaccines;preclinical evaluation;public health relevance;research study;response;success;tool;tumor","Synthesis and Evaluation of Zwitterionic Carbohydrate Immunostimulants","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The success of vaccination requires the generation of a strong immune response to the inoculated antigens able to provide long-term protective immunity against infectious diseases.

"Biodefense; Cancer; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Digestive Diseases - (Peptic Ulcer); Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Helicobacter pylori is a bacterial pathogen that infects the gastric mucosa of 50% of humans worldwide and elicits gastritis that can progress to peptic ulcers or gastric cancer which accounts for more than 650000 deaths each year. No vaccine is available to prevent or treat H. pylori infection and antibiotic resistance is an ever-increasing problem that undermines treatment efficacy. A distinguishing feature of H. pylori infection is the chronic polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN neutrophil)-dominant inflammatory response. Patient biopsy samples demonstrate that PMNs reach the mucus layer over the gastric epithelium and engulf large numbers of bacteria in this locale. However H. pylori is not killed and NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) released into the extracellular milieu damage host tissue. Despite the central role of neutrophils in H. pylori pathogenesis our understanding of bacteria-PMN interactions is rudimentary. Thus we undertook this study to address critical knowledge gaps regarding the phenotype and fate of infected PMNs and their bacterial cargo. To this end we created a collection of isogenic bacterial mutants that lack majorvirulence factors alone or in combination and also exploited recent discoveries that have revolutionized our understanding of the role of neutrophils in the immune response as indicated by their immunomodulatory capacity and ability to undergo subtype differentiation in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that H. pylori exploits PMN phenotypic plasticity as part of its virulence strategy. Consistent with this we present extensive convincing preliminary data to suggest that H. pylori-neutrophil interactions are significantly more complex than previously appreciated and which define three distinct stages of infection. During early infection H. pylori evades killing bymanipulation of phagosome maturation and granule targeting. This is followed a few hours later by induction of PMN subtype differentiation. In parallel PMN apoptosis is significantly impaired and cell lifespan is prolonged. After about 3 days infected PMNs succumb not by delayed apoptosis but rather by an atypical mechanism of death that supports robust extracellular H. pylori growth upon and around dying PMN carcasses. To test this infection model we will in three specific aims analyze bacterial trafficking and degranulation define changes in PMN phenotype and functional capacity elucidate the effects of H. pylori on PMN lifespan and mechanism of cell death and begin to determine the roles of major bacterial virulence factors in these aspects of disease. Methods utilized will include but are not limited to super-resolution confocal microscopy electron microscopy RNA-Seq and high-throughput analysis of cytokine production using Fluidigm microfluidic chips. Finally we will also determine if clinically approve PMN apoptosis-inducing agents can accelerate PMN death or undermine Hp survival as a first step toward evaluation of their therapeutic potential.","Accounting;Activities of Daily Living;Address;Antibiotic Resistance;Apoptosis;Bacteria;Biochemical;Biopsy Specimen;Carcinogens;Cell Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Chronic;Coculture Techniques;Collection;Complex;Confocal Microscopy;Cytoplasmic Granules;DNA;Data;Development;Disease;Electron Microscopy;Enzymes;Epithelium;Evaluation;Gastric mucosa;Gastritis;Gene Expression;Goals;Growth;Health;Helicobacter Infections;Helicobacter pylori;Hour;Human;Immune response;Infection;Inflammatory Response;Inhibition of Apoptosis;Killings;Knowledge;Link;Locales;Longevity;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Methods;Microfluidic Microchips;Modeling;Molecular;Mucous body substance;NADPH Oxidase;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptic Ulcer;Phagosomes;Phenotype;Process;Production;Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Resolution;Role;Staging;Stomach;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Treatment Efficacy;Vaccines;Variant;Virulence;Virulence Factors;arginase;base;cytokine;extracellular;high throughput analysis;in vivo;malignant stomach neoplasm;mutant;neutrophil;novel;novel therapeutics;pathogen;prevent;roscovitine;trafficking;transcriptome sequencing","Neutrophil Plasticity and H. pylori Pathogenesis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects 50% of all humans and causes both peptic ulcers and gastric cancer and for this reason is classified as a carcinogen.

"Clinical Research; Muscular Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","PROJECT SUMMARYThe overall goals of Core C are to provide research training and carry out other education-related missionsof the MDCRC. In particular Core C will support two Medical Student Fellowships a PostdoctoralFellowship a Post-Baccalaureate Research Internship and an Undergraduate Research Fellowship. Themedical and postdoctoral fellows and the intern will be mentored by both Core Co-Directors (Drs. Campbelland Mathews) and the undergraduate fellow will be mentored by one of them. The educational efforts of theCenter are vital because there is an urgent need for basic scientists and clinicians who can partner todevelop and test muscular dystrophy therapies. By establishing the Medical Student Fellowship we willtrain the next generation of neurologists in translational research related to muscular dystrophy. This full-time fellowship will enable two medical students per year to participate in all aspects of the MDCRCincluding: care of muscular dystrophy patients in the neuromuscular disease clinics; clinical evaluation ofpatients participating in Project 2 under the supervision of Dr. Mathews; evaluation of muscle biopsies withDr. Steven Moore; and study patient cells in Dr. Campbell's laboratory. Finally these students will presenttheir findings from interesting cases at the Neuromuscular Disease Conference once a month. ThePostdoctoral Research Fellowship will train scientists in the basic research of muscular dystrophy byproviding a PhD MD or MD/PhD graduate with an intensive research experience in Dr. Campbellslaboratory. This experience will be complemented by observation of patient care in a clinical settingenhancing the fellows understanding and appreciation of the clinical side of translational research. ThePost-Baccalaureate Research Internship is designed to encourage recent college graduates interested inpursuing graduate degrees to move into translational science by providing a one-year intensive researchexperience in an MDCRC laboratory before s/he enters graduate school. The Undergraduate ResearchFellowship has a similar purpose but will go to students who are still enrolled at the University of Iowa;these individuals will work closely with a postdoctoral advisor in an MDCRC laboratory. Finally the IowaMDCRC will continue its tradition of involving patients and patient advocates in the Center with a two-dayconference hosted by Core A and Project 2 and tours of Center laboratories for patients and their familieshosted by Core C. The goal of the conference is to educate the patients about ongoing translationalresearch in the MDCRC and provide a forum where they can ask questions concerning muscular dystrophyresearch. This conference will serve as an excellent training opportunity for the current Wellstone fellowsand intern all of whom will participate in the conference. Through these activities Core C will accelerate theeducation mission of the MDCRC and provide a vibrant training environment for clinician scientists.","Advocate;Basic Science;Biopsy;Caring;Cells;Childhood;Clinic;Clinical;Complement;Doctor of Philosophy;Education;Enrollment;Environment;Evaluation;Family;Fellowship;Goals;Graduate Degree;Individual;Internships;Iowa;Laboratories;Medical;Medical Students;Mentors;Mission;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Neurologist;Neurology;Neuromuscular Diseases;Patient Care;Patients;Postdoctoral Fellow;Research;Research Training;Schools;Scientist;Side;Students;Supervision;Testing;Time;Training;Training and Education;Translational Research;Universities;Work;college;design;experience;interest;next generation;research clinical testing;symposium;training opportunity;undergraduate research","Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center","PROJECT NARRATIVECore C will coordinate the research training and education mission of the MDCRC.

"Clinical Research; Health Services; Muscular Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","CORE B SUMMARYThe Muscle Tissue/Cell Culture/Diagnostics Core of the Iowa Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy CooperativeResearch Center is a multifaceted laboratory that serves as a local national and international resource forresearch on muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases. This Core has two major goals. Firstly ithas established and will expand a tissue and cell culture Repository to support basic and translational researchefforts. Currently this Repository contains muscle biopsies from more than 3500 patients with neuromusculardisorders as well as cryopreserved fibroblasts from more than 300 patients with myopathic diseasepredominantly muscular dystrophies. Well-characterized tissues and cells from the Core are made available toresearch investigators at Iowa as well as other academic centers across the USA and around the world.Secondly the Core provides specialty diagnostic services that are not readily available through clinicallaboratories and facilitates research on and the development of new diagnostic tests for eventual transfer intoclinical laboratories. These diagnostic services are very closely integrated with clinical laboratory testingcarried out in the Department of Pathology at the University of Iowa. Together Core B and the Department ofPathology services provide state-of-the-art diagnostic testing for patients seen at the University of IowaHospitals and Clinics and for patients referred to Iowa from throughout the USA and from several othercountries. This infrastructure provides key support for clinical trials of neuromuscular disease.","Autopsy;Basic Science;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinics and Hospitals;Consent;Country;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Services;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Evaluation;Fibroblasts;Goals;International;Iowa;Laboratories;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Myoblasts;Myocardial tissue;Neuromuscular Diseases;Online Systems;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pathology;Patients;Procedures;Process;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Sampling;Services;Shipping;Ships;Skeletal Muscle;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translational Research;Universities;Urine;base;dystroglycanopathy;interest;medical specialties;novel diagnostics;repository;research and development;tissue/cell culture","Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center","n/a","NINDS","9108459","6/28/2016","RFA-AR-15-002","5U54NS053672-12","5","U54","NS","053672","12","","","6/8/2005"," ","ZHD1-DSR-Y","8022","1899881","MOORE, STEVEN A","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","400938"," ","262910","138028"," "," ",

The overall goal of this project is to improve care of patients with dystroglycanopathies. At present there is no specific treatment for these patients and management is largely symptomatic. We anticipate that treatment trials will be initiated in the near future. In this project we will work toward improved care through three aims. First we will extend current knowledge about disease manifestations and variables that impact progression through a natural history study. Data collection will include standard measures of motor strength function speech and language and quality of life. We will test potential gene variants (SNPs) that were identified in Duchenne muscular dystrophy to see if they modify disease severity in our dystroglycanopathy cohort. Second we will optimize clinical outcome measures required for clinical trials. Clinical outcome data gathered from our longitudinal study is critical for trial design and the addition of new measures focusing on the upper extremity will allow a wide range of subjects to participate in future trials. We will also develop and test a remote participation module to minimize the travel burden and cost for participants. Finally we will identify and validate biomarkers (muscle ultrasound plasma and urine proteins plasma and urine microRNAs) responsive to disease stage and progression using state-of-the-art detection methods. Candidate biomarkers will be validated using patient outcome measure data collected in the natural history study. As a result of the work proposed patients with a dystroglycanopathy will receive better clinical care now and in the future as we use the data collected to design trials that test novel interventions.","Adult;Biological;Biological Markers;Boxing;Brain;Caring;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Design;Complement;Complex;Counseling;Data;Data Collection;Detection;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Duchenne muscular dystrophy;Dystrophin;Evaluation;Extracellular Matrix;Eye;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genotype;Glycoproteins;Goals;Image;Individual;Intervention;Knowledge;Language;Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies;Link;Longitudinal Studies;Measures;Membrane;Methods;MicroRNAs;Monitor;Motor;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Natural History;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Participant;Patient Care;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Plasma;Plasma Proteins;Preparation;Proteins;Proteomics;Quality of life;Rare Diseases;Reporting;Research;Risk;Role;Severity of illness;Speech;Staging;Testing;Time;Travel;Ultrasonography;Upper Extremity;Urine;Walker-Warburg syndrome;Work;abstracting;alpha Dystroglycan;base;brain malformation;candidate marker;clinical care;clinical phenotype;clinically significant;cohort;cost;design;dystroglycanopathy;fukutin;fukutin related protein;genetic variant;glycosylation;improved;meetings;microRNA biomarkers;novel;protein-O-mannosyltransferase 1;protein-O-mannosyltransferase 2;standard measure;telehealth;treatment trial;trial design","Project II: Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center","n/a","NINDS","9108458","6/28/2016","RFA-AR-15-002","5U54NS053672-12","5","U54","NS","053672","12","","","6/8/2005"," ","ZHD1-DSR-Y","8021","9248330","MATHEWS, KATHERINE DIANNE","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","407021"," ","285489","121532"," "," ",
"Biotechnology; Muscular Dystrophy; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","Project 1  Project Summary The overall goal of our research is to develop therapeutic strategies for treating muscular dystrophy. Our current research focuses on the dystroglycanopathies  muscular dystrophies in which aberrant post- translational modification of the -dystroglycan (-DG) protein results in a reduction of its glycosylation and thereby in loss of an essential link between it and its laminin-G domain-containing ligands in the extracellular matrix (ECM). At least eighteen genes encode post-translational enzymes that act on -DG and mutations therein cause congenital/limb-girdle muscular dystrophies conditions that can be accompanied by brain and eye abnormalities. Although great progress has been made on the identification and characterization of dystroglycanopathy genes we still do not fully understand how mutations therein lead to the observed abnormalities in dystroglycan glycosylation and to muscular dystrophy. The overarching hypothesis of our research is that a thorough understanding of 1) the structure of an ECM ligand-binding glycan on native dystroglycan 2) the abnormal glycan structure(s) in dystroglycanopathy patients and 3) the pathological mechanisms underlying the abnormal glycosylation and receptor function in the dystroglycanopathies are required to develop rational diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We will approach our objectives using patient cells and state-of-the-art biological cell biological and glycobiological analyses. Specific Aim 1 will establish the in vivo relevance of the LARGE repeats on -DG in skeletal muscle. These studies will reveal whether LARGE repeats are present on native -DG and establish their contribution to ligand binding in vivo. Specific Aim 2 will define the ligand- and antibody-binding properties of LARGE repeats establish the binding affinity and absolute stoichiometry of the LARGE-dependent glycan for its ECM ligands and determine the specificity of antibodies that target the dystroglycan glycan. Specific Aim 3 will establish the post-translational modification status of -DG in various dystroglycanopathies. Identifying the molecular defects in -DG within different patient populations will improve our understanding of the modifications that will be required for therapeutic treatments. Finally Specific Aim 4 will identify the mechanistic defects that result in abnormal -DG glycosylation. We will analyze the enzymatic activities of several dystroglycanopathy genes (LARGE POMK POMGNT2 B3GALNT2 and B4GAT1) and correlate these with functional glycosylation in patient cells and severity of the clinical phenotype. We will also prepare mutant constructs and test the enzymatic activity and sub-cellular localization of the translated proteins. Classification of the mutant enzymes as inactive or defective for trafficking will provide a framework for developing novel therapeutic strategies based on the functional defect. Collectively these aims will provide a critical understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying dystroglycanopathies and a rationale for future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.","Affinity;Antibodies;Antibody Specificity;Beta-glucuronidase;Binding;Biological;Categories;Cells;Chemicals;Classification;Clinical;Collecting Cell;Core Protein;Cryoultramicrotomy;Defect;Development;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Dystroglycans;Enzymes;Evaluation;Extracellular Matrix;Eye Abnormalities;Future;Genes;Genotype;Glucuronic Acids;Glycoside Hydrolases;Goals;Hydrolysis;Immunoblotting;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Immunofluorescence Microscopy;In Vitro;Individual;Laminin;Lead;Length;Ligand Binding;Ligands;Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies;Link;Measures;Methods;Modification;Molecular;Molecular Weight;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mus;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Neuromuscular Junction;Patients;Polysaccharides;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Property;Proteins;Research;Sarcolemma;Severities;Skeletal Muscle;Specificity;Structure;Surface Plasmon Resonance;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translating;Xylose;alpha Dystroglycan;base;brain abnormalities;clinical phenotype;dystroglycanopathy;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;insight;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;overexpression;patient population;polymerization;receptor function;stoichiometry;trafficking","Project I:Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center","n/a","NINDS","9108457","6/28/2016","RFA-AR-15-002","5U54NS053672-12","5","U54","NS","053672","12","","","6/8/2005"," ","ZHD1-DSR-Y","8020","1962294","CAMPBELL, KEVIN P.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","376583"," ","250130","126453"," "," ",

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the University of Iowa MDCRC is to perform pre-clinical and clinical translational research on the various muscular dystrophies that arise from abnormal processing of the dystroglycan protein (dystroglycanopathies). The Center will achieve this overall goal by enabling translational research on the dystroglycanopathies and providing advanced diagnostic services. Our MDCRC application is composed of two projects and three cores all of which are directed by investigators with a proven track record of excellence and collaboration in basic translational and clinical research. Project 1 (Campbell) will investigate the molecular pathogenesis of the dystroglycanopathies and evaluate various mechanistic defects that lead to abnormalities in dystroglycan glycosylation using cells from dystroglycanopathy patients with known mutations. A major asset for this project is our recently developed enzymatic assays for several dystroglycanopathy genes. Project 2 (Mathews) will identify and characterize dystroglycanopathy patients of all genotypes and define outcome measures that can be used to evaluate disease progression in defined cohorts during therapeutic trials. Candidate modifier genes and serum biomarkers will also be established and evaluated in different patient populations. Core A (Campbell and Moore) is an administrative core that will coordinate the activities within and outside the Centeras a means to promote an interactive and collaborative research environment and to engage patients in muscular dystrophy research. Core B (Moore) a Muscle-Tissue/Cell-Culture/Diagnostics Core will support Projects 1 and 2 serve as a national tissue and cell-culture resource for research provide specialized diagnostic testing for a wide range of muscular dystrophies and maintain the infrastructure needed for the evaluation of muscle biopsies during clinical trials. Finally Core C (Mathews and Campbell) will coordinate our Training and Education initiative. Among the support this Core provides will be fellowships enabling two medical students per year to perform research in the Center and to participate in the care of patients alongside Dr. Mathews. The highly integrated cores and projects of this Center coupled with extensive collaborations with national and international leaders in the field of dystroglycanopathies will accelerate the tempo of discovery in preclinical translational research and also establish the clinical-trial readiness of a cohort of dystroglycanopathy patients.      ","Antibodies;Autopsy;Basic Science;Binding;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biopsy;Blood;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Community Outreach;Coupled;Defect;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Services;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Disease Progression;Dystroglycans;Environment;Evaluation;Family;Fellowship;Fibroblasts;Genes;Genotype;Goals;Image;International;Internships;Iowa;Laboratories;Lead;Ligands;Measures;Medical Students;MicroRNAs;Mission;Molecular;Muscle;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Myocardial tissue;Natural History;Neuromuscular Diseases;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome Measure;Pathogenesis;Patient Care;Patients;Pediatric Neurology;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Postdoctoral Fellow;Process;Property;Proteins;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Qualifying;Readiness;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Sampling;Scientist;Serum;Shipping;Ships;Skeletal Muscle;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Trials;Tissues;Training;Training and Education;Translating;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Urine;alpha Dystroglycan;base;cohort;dystroglycanopathy;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;insight;interest;medical schools;medical specialties;novel;patient population;pre-clinical;public health relevance;repository;skills;symposium;tissue/cell culture;undergraduate research;web site","Muscular Dystrophy Cooperative Research Center","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our MDCRC renewal promotes the NIH mission by enabling pre-clinical and clinical translational research on the dystroglycanopathies providing advanced diagnostic services and training basic and clinical scientists.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Genetics; Huntington's Disease; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal is a competitive renewal for a unique study that measures the volume function and development of the striatum in children at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD). HD is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a DNA triplet repeat (CAG) expansion and manifests in cognitive behavioral and motor changes. Average age of onset is 40 yrs. The disease eventually affects most brain regions yet the primary pathology is located in the striatum. Degeneration is a key component in the disease process yet research in the past few years has supported the notion that a crucial component of the pathoetiology of HD is abnormal brain development. The grant was funded in 2009 to investigate this hypothesis by the study of children at risk for HD (those with a parent with HD). As HD is an autosomal dominant disease each child has a 50% chance of inheritance. The at-risk participants are genotyped and those who are gene-expanded (GE) are compared to those who are gene non-expanded (GNE); a 3rd comparison group is healthy control children (HC) (no HD in family). Assessments include MRI and measures of motor function cognitive skills and behavior. The current proposal is designed to extend our studies by conducting a more thorough evaluation of the growth and development of the striatum. The original study evaluated volumes using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) and white matter integrity using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Results (shown in progress report) indicate volume deficits in the striatum with relative sparing or enlargement of the thalamus and cerebellum; and abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) in multiple tracks. The new protocol will add: 1) evaluation of striatal resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) 2) Molecular measures of striatal integrity using (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and 3) the evaluation of developmental trajectories (growth between ages 6-18 years) of brain structure via an 'accelerated longitudinal' format. Compensatory mechanisms such as overgrowth of the cerebellum and thalamus will also be investigated. Functional assessment will include measures of cognition and motor skill. Information gained from this proposal could be key to identifying the earliest possible time-frame for neuroprotective interventions.","Affect;Age;Age of Onset;Anisotropy;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain region;Budgets;CAG repeat;Cerebellum;Child;Cognition;Cognitive;Corpus striatum structure;DNA;Development;Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Disease;Evaluation;Family;Financial compensation;Funding;Genes;Genotype;Glutamates;Glutamine;Goals;Grant;Growth;Growth and Development function;Health;Huntington Disease;Impulsivity;Insula of Reil;Intervention;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy;Measures;Memory;Metabolic;Molecular;Motor;Motor Skills;N-acetylaspartate;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Occipital lobe;Onset of illness;Parents;Parietal lobe gyrus;Participant;Pathology;Process;Progress Reports;Protocols documentation;Research;Rest;Risk;Seeds;Structure;Thalamic structure;Time;Trinucleotide Repeats;base;brain volume;cognitive skill;comparison group;design;frontal lobe;inattention;interest;molecular marker;putamen;white matter","Growth and Development of the Striatum in Huntington's Disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is a competitive renewal for a unique study that measures the volume function and development of the striatum in children at risk for Huntington's Disease (HD).

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systolic heart failure (HF) is a devastating condition with high socioeconomic impact. Progress in the development of new pharmacological agents to treat HF is stagnant. Standard therapy targets the untoward peripheral effects of the heightened activity of the renin-angiotensin- system (RAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) compensatory mechanisms that seek to maintain pressure in the face of a low cardiac output. As yet there is no specific therapy for the inflammatory state that accompanies HF and contributes to adverse outcomes. Large clinical trials demonstrated no benefit of anti-cytokine agents which can have serious side effects. Recent studies have revealed that the central nervous system actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) contribute to the pathogenesis of HF - in particular to the detrimental increase in sympathetic nerve activity. That work has focused almost exclusively on the effects of PICs inside the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with littleattention to the effects of circulating PICs that reflect the peripheral inflammatory state but aretoo large to cross the BBB. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that blood-borne PICs act upon the subfornical organ (SFO) a forebrain circumventricular organ that lacks a BBB to increase sympathetic activity in normal rats. We hypothesize that the high circulating levels of PICs in HF induce an inflammatory/excitatory state in the SFO that drives inflammatory/excitatory mechanisms downstream in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to increase peripheral sympathetic nerve activity. Since PIC receptors mediate molecular rather than synaptic events their effects on the SFO are likely mediated by upregulation of intracellular signaling mechanisms related to RAS reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The proposed studies will: 1) determine the contribution of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b acting upon their receptors in SFO to sympathetic excitation in normal rat and rats with HF; 2) identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms activated in the SFO by TNF-a and IL-1b and their impact on cellular and molecular mechanisms downstream in PVN; 3) determine whether counteracting the effects of PICs at the SFO level is a viable potential therapeutic strategy to reduce sympathetic excitation and its consequences in HF. A combination of molecular immunohistochemical and in vivo electrophysiological and hemodynamic recording techniques will be used to elucidate the mechanisms by which blood-borne PICs acting on the SFO influence neurohumoral excitation. Since the SFO lacks a BBB these studies may identify targets for therapeutic intervention in the inflammatory process in HF that are accessible to systemic drug administration.","Adverse effects;Angiotensin II;Arteries;Attention;Attenuated;Automobile Driving;Blood;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Cytokine Receptors;Development;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Endothelial Cells;Event;Functional disorder;Health;Heart failure;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukins;Intracarotid;Laboratories;Learning;Lesion;Low Cardiac Output;Measures;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Nerve;Neuraxis;Neuroglia;Neurons;Neurosecretory Systems;Obesity;Organ;Pathogenesis;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma;Process;Production;Prosencephalon;Rattus;Reactive Oxygen Species;Receptor Angiotensin Type 1;Renin-Angiotensin System;Role;Severities;Signal Transduction;Sodium;Source;Subfornical Organ;Sympathetic Nervous System;Synapses;Systemic Therapy;Systolic heart failure;TNF gene;Techniques;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Thirst;Up-Regulation;Work;adverse outcome;cyclooxygenase 2;cytokine;endoplasmic reticulum stress;hemodynamics;in vivo;increased appetite;insight;interest;intravenous administration;intravenous injection;macrophage;neurochemistry;paraventricular nucleus;pressure;receptor;response;socioeconomics;targeted treatment;therapeutic target","Cytokines and Sympathetic Activation in Heart Failure","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will determine the mechanisms by which blood-borne pro-inflammatory cytokines acting on the subfornical organ (SFO) in the forebrain contribute to activation of the sympathetic nervous system in a rat model of systolic heart failure By learning more about molecular mechanisms in SFO that respond to peripheral inflammation we hope to identify targets for the treatment of central mechanisms driving sympathetic activity in heart failure.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transducin (Gt) signaling in rods and cones. A remarkable level of understanding has been achieved in the field on the mechanisms of transducin in the phototransduction cascade. The current focus of our research is on the mechanisms of transducin trafficking and transducin-dependent modulation of photoreceptor responses beyond phototransduction. Very little is known about transport of transducin from the inner segment (IS) to the outer segment (OS). Uncoordinated 119 protein (UNC119) has emerged as a major factor facilitating the IS->OS transport of transducin- (Gt). We propose to investigate the structure and properties of the trafficking complex between Gt and UNC119 by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and X- ray crystallography. Based on the preliminary SAXS analysis we hypothesize that a novel interface between UNC119 and Gt is essential to the UNC119-induced dissociation of Gt subunits and protein solubilization from the membrane. The interface and the proposed model of Gt solubilization by UNC119 will be probed with mutational analysis. Solubilization of Gt from IS membranes with the formation of the Gt-UNC119 complex is the initial step in the IS->OS transport of Gt which terminates with the cargo release into the OS. A small ARF-like 3 GTPase ARL3 will be investigated as a putative release factor in Gt trafficking. We hypothesize that Gt is released from the complex with UNC119 by a mechanism involving ARL3-induced conformational changes both within and outside the acyl-binding cavity of UNC119 and will test this mechanism. Defects in protein transport are a common cause of photoreceptor degeneration. Elucidation of molecular details of transducin trafficking will significantly contribute to the understanding of transport of peripheral membrane proteins in photoreceptors and will have important implications for retinal diseases. Finally we will investigate a novel concept on the role of light-dispersed transducin inmodulation of the synaptic output of rods. We hypothesize that Gt regulates rod-to-rod bipolar cell signaling by altering UNC119 interactions with major synaptic players CaBP4 and RIBEYE and/or via direct effects on the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and synaptic machinery. The proposed analysis of the synaptic modulation by transducin may profoundly impact the established paradigm on transducin signaling in photoreceptors.","Address;Area;Binding;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cells;Cilia;Complex;Defect;Diffusion;Dissociation;Enzymes;Exposure to;G-substrate;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genes;Goals;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Health;Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Human;Knockout Mice;Laboratories;Light;Lipids;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Structure;Orthologous Gene;Output;Peripheral;Photoreceptors;Phototransduction;Presynaptic Terminals;Property;Protein Isoforms;Protein Subunits;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Resolution;Retina;Retinal Diseases;Rhodopsin;Rod Outer Segments;Roentgen Rays;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;Structure;Synapses;Testing;Transducin;Transgenic Organisms;Vertebrate Photoreceptors;Vision Disorders;X-Ray Crystallography;base;insight;mutant;novel;phosphodiesterase 6;photoreceptor degeneration;programs;protein complex;protein protein interaction;protein transport;release factor;response;retinal rods;ribbon synapse;trafficking;voltage","Molecular Mechanism of Photoreceptor G Protein Signaling","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Transducin is the key molecule mediating signal transfer in the vertebrate phototransduction cascade.

"Cancer; Hematology; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable largely due to acquired resistance to currently available chemotherapies. A sub-population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in MM has been established; these MM-CSCs display increased tumorigenic and self-renewal capabilities along with chemo-resistance to several MM agents. Bortezomib (BTZ Velcade) is a frontline MM drug however BTZ resistance is a major clinical challenge. Recent literature suggests that CSCs frequently show fundamental differences in oxidative metabolism relative to normal stem cells. Therefore redox chemotherapeutics that induce mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and/or inhibit antioxidant mechanisms could potentiate selective killing of CSCs and complement standard chemotherapy to improve cancer prognosis. Our preliminary results show that MM- CSCs exhibit lower steady-state levels of ROS relative to bulk MM cells. Combination of BTZ (a ROS-inducing drug) with mitochondrial-targeted decyl-triphenylphosphonium agent (dTPP) or with a pharmacological inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (auranofin) resulted in selective clonogenic killing of MM-CSCs and not normal CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The current proposal will determine the biochemical mechanism and provide preclinical validation on the combination of redox-directed chemotherapeutics (dTPP and auranofin) to enhance BTZ cytotoxicity in MM-CSCs. In vitro studies on role of redox dysregulation in selective sensitization of MM-CSCs will be done in MM cell lines and primary human MM samples. In vivo studies will utilize systemic MM models (adoptively transferred primary human samples in NOD/SCID/c-/- mice and 5TGM1 syngeneic model). The proposed studies will provide a strong rationale for developing combination strategies that will enable oxidative metabolic targeting and selective elimination of MM-CSCs with potential to inhibit MM relapses and improve therapeutic outcome of MM patients.","Antioxidants;Auranofin;Biochemical;Biology;Bortezomib;CD34 gene;Cancer Prognosis;Cancer stem cell;Cell Death;Cell Line;Cell Respiration;Cells;Chemicals;Clinical;Clinical Protocols;Clinical Trials;Combined Modality Therapy;Complement;Disease remission;Drug Metabolic Detoxication;Exhibits;Genes;Health;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoiesis;Hematopoietic;Homeostasis;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;In Vitro;Killings;Lead;Link;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;Multiple Myeloma;Mus;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma Cells;Population;Positioning Attribute;Production;Publishing;Radio;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Relapse;Research;Resistance;Role;Sampling;Scientist;Stem cells;TXN gene;Therapeutic;Treatment Efficacy;Tumorigenicity;Validation;Velcade;base;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;cytotoxicity;effective therapy;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;interest;mortality;mouse model;novel;pre-clinical;response;self-renewal;small hairpin RNA;small molecule;stem;survival outcome;therapy outcome;thioredoxin reductase;tumorigenic","Targeting Cancer Stem Cells in Multiple Myeloma Therapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hard-to-treat plasma cell malignancy that exhibits frequent relapses and high mortality.

"Bioengineering; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Heart Disease; Lung; Networking and Information Technology R&D; Obesity; Patient Safety","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity has reached global epidemic proportions in both adults and children. Obesity has a major impact on cardiovascular (CV) disorders because of its adverse effects on cardiac function structure and various CV risk factors. MR imaging has great potential in estimating these changes and stratifying obese subjects for risk of major advanced cardiac events. However the physiological changes resulting from obesity and associated pulmonary comorbidities often make it difficult for many obese subject to comply with current clinical protocols that require several breath holds and long scan time. Short free breathing protocols are urgently needed for the cardiac evaluation of obese subjects. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a short 3-D free-breathing & un-gated cardiac imaging protocol to evaluate cardiac structure function perfusion and fibrosis in obese subjects in around twenty minutes of scan time. This protocol is enabled by synergistic developments in novel ungated sequences and a novel manifold regularization framework. The reconstruction framework which exploits the manifold structure of images and patches in the dataset is ideally suited to harness the flexibility and high acquisition efficiency of ungated 3-D sequences. The main hypothesis is that the implicit motion compensated and motion resolved reconstruction scheme will provide good recovery of the datasets in the protocol from highly under sampled data. We will quantitatively determine the utility of the free-breathing & ungated framework to provide reconstructions that are equivalent to current breath-hold acquisitions. This framework is expected to significantly improve the compliance of obese subjects. In addition this approach also provides co-registered 3-D volumes with different contrasts which will greatly improve quantification visualization and radiologic interpretation. The manifold learning framework is powerful and highly innovative; it can be readily applied to a variety of dynamic applications beyond cardiac imaging (vocal tract imaging liver imaging lung imaging).

"Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major world-wide public health problem. For decades there has been a notion that metabolic disease in obesity is associated more with adipocyte size than numbers. Moreover recent studies have highlighted a connection between adipocyte size membrane tension and adipogenesis - leading some to postulate adipocyte-autonomous mechanisms of lipid homeostasis. To date there are no molecular candidates for this hypothesized adipocyte-membrane stretch sensor nor has anyone put forth a testable model. As some ion channels can signal in response to membrane-stretch we applied the patch-clamp technique to freshly isolated mature adipocytes and identified a novel stretch/swell-activated ionic current SWELL1 (LRRC8a). SWELL1 is important for cytoplasmic volume regulation and can signal via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. The objective of the current proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms of SWELL1 action on adipocyte function. Our hypothesis is that the novel mechanosensor SWELL1 senses adipocyte size and regulates growth of the lipid droplet via Akt-mediated effects on lipolysis and cellular glucose uptake. The rationale for the proposed studies is that delineating a novel SWELL1 signaling pathway linking adipocyte size sensing to insulin signaling and lipid homeostasis will advance our understanding of adipocyte biology and provide innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity. To test the above hypothesis we propose the following three specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize SWELL1 current in adipocytes from lean obese and fasted mice. Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of SWELL1-PI3K-Akt signaling in adipocytes. Aim 3: Determine the regulatory effect of SWELL1 on lipid metabolism and adiposity in obesity. The contribution of this proposal is significant because it delineates a novel SWELL1 signaling pathway regulating insulin signaling and adipocyte growth thereby advancing our understanding of adipocyte biology. This proposal is innovative because as ion channels are inherently ""druggable"" SWELL1 may provide a new pharmacological target for the treatment of obesity.      ","Address;Adipocytes;C-terminal;Cell Line;Cell Size;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Fasting;Goals;Growth;Health;Health Care Costs;Heart Diseases;Homeostasis;Human;Hypertrophy;Insulin;Ion Channel;Knockout Mice;Leucine-Rich Repeat;Link;Lipids;Lipolysis;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mechanics;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Metabolic Diseases;Mind;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Obese Mice;Obesity;Obesity associated disease;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Pathway interactions;Persons;Phosphatidylinositols;Phosphotransferases;Protein Family;Protein Kinase Interaction;Proteins;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Public Health;Regulation;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Societies;Stretching;Swelling;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;adipocyte biology;base;glucose uptake;in vivo;innovation;insight;insulin signaling;knock-down;knowledge base;leucine-rich repeat protein;lipid biosynthesis;lipid metabolism;loss of function;member;novel;obesity prevention;obesity treatment;public health relevance;research study;response;sensor;therapeutic target","Tuning fat cell size and obesity through SWELL1","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and associated diseases are major health concerns in today's society.

"Bioengineering; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Applications of ceramics in dentistry are steadily expanding due to outstanding progress in the development and control of materials microstructures chemistry and processing techniques. Meanwhile the use of ceramic parts in orthopedic joint replacement procedures remains widespread. Ceramic surfaces are attractive for joint replacement because of low wear rates but they are inherently brittle. As a consequence even if success rates are generally high in vivo failures do occur both in orthopedics and in dentistry. There is a need for reliable high strength bioceramics with low abrasiveness for use in both orthopedics and dentistry. Our goal is to develop ultrafine-grained zirconia/spinel ceramics with synergistic phase combination leading to high grain boundary stability high reliability and fracture toughness. This project presents a major technological innovation that relies on 1) the combination of synergistic microstructural and thermal properties between zirconia (3Y-TZP) and ultrafine-grained nanospinel (MgAl2O4) in dual phase bioceramics and 2) the creation of a controlled ultrafine-grained surface inhibiting hydrolytic degradation and reducing abrasiveness. These dual-phase materials will advance the field of bioceramics by ensuring longer life performance in orthopedic and dental applications. In specific Aim 1 zirconia-spinel ceramics (3Y- TZP/nS) will be synthesized and characterized. In specific Aim 2 conditions for grain size refinement will be established and resistance to low temperature degradation (LTD) wear characteristics and mechanical properties of ultrafine-grained 3Y-TZP and 3Y- TZP/nS ceramics will be measured. Expected outcomes of the proposed work are the development and production of novel bioceramics with high strength high reliability low abrasiveness while offering excellent esthetics when needed from the presence of the nanospinel phase. The projected significant reduction in abrasiveness of current zirconia ceramics and novel zirconia-nanospinel bioceramics by developing an innovative grain refinement process constitutes another important translational outcome. The impact of the proposed work will originate from the development of new materials and technology and may extend well beyond orthopedic and dental fields if as we anticipate these novel bioceramics exhibit superplasticity which would greatly facilitate processing at high temperature.      ","Address;Alloys;Aluminum Oxide;Arthroplasty Replacement Hip;Behavior;Ceramics;Cereals;Characteristics;Chemistry;Complex;Dental;Dentistry;Development;Diffusion;Ensure;Esthetics;Exhibits;Failure;Fracture;Generations;Goals;Growth;Head;Health Care Costs;Heating;High temperature of physical object;Joint Revision;Lead;Life;Life Expectancy;Measures;Mechanics;Metals;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orthopedics;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Phase;Powder dose form;Procedures;Process;Production;Property;Prosthesis;Replacement Arthroplasty;Resistance;Stress;Surface;Techniques;Technology;Temperature;Testing;Ultrafine;Work;Yttrium;Zirconium;aging population;biomaterial compatibility;ceramic restoration;cold temperature;cost;experience;improved;in vivo;innovation;knee replacement arthroplasty;nanomechanical;novel;particle;public health relevance;restorative dentistry;segregation;spinell;stem;success;technological innovation;yttria;zirconium oxide","Synergistic Phase Combination for High Strength Ultrafine-Grained Bioceramics","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  With the aging population and longer life expectancy the total number of hip and knee arthroplasty revision procedures is expected to exceed 67000 and 120000 per year by 2020 respectively with an estimated health care cost of $2.2 billion per year.

"Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is a significant issue in health care delivery affecting 116 million Americans at a conservative cost of $560 billion. This application seeks renewal of support for an interdisciplinary training program in pain research at the University of Iowa. The program has been highly successful in terms of increasing collaborations among trainers and mentoring pre- and postdoctoral trainees of exemplary quality to independent funding and careers. The program will continue to study the cellular molecular pharmacological physiological and anatomical mechanisms that subserve acute and chronic pain while further strengthening the clinical and translational work begun during the previous award. The 16 core program faculty are NIH-funded investigators with complementary expertise in the fields of molecular cellular and systems neurobiology. They comprise a balanced representation of basic and physician scientists as well as bench and patient-based research. Each trainer has a strong record of training both predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows and will also mentor a subset of junior trainers of great promise. Support is requested for two predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees for this award period. In line with our goal to strengthen translational research the postdoctoral positions will be primarily targeted for MD MD/PhD PT/PhD or DPT trainees but will also accept PhD trainees with a strong interest in translational research. These individuals will benefit from a period of protected time to learn theelements of research and/or to restart their research programs in advance of a faculty level appointment. Two nurse scientists continue as adjunct trainers to pursue collaborations in clinical and translational research programs developed in the last award period. In the next funding period the program proposes to build a stronger relationship with members of the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science who have expertise in patient-centered outcomes research and comparative effectiveness research. This approach will recruit new faculty to the training program and increase attractiveness to clinicians. The training program provides a highly structured and diverse program of didactic coursework including monthly seminars weekly journal clubs and biweekly work-in-progress meetings that is coupled with research training in a highly collaborative and inter-active environment. All courses as well as mechanisms of interaction and trainee evaluation are established.

"Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Neurosciences; Patient Safety","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The successful conduct of clinical trials requires an excellent collaboration between a Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and the clinical sites where subjects are enrolled and followed. One would be hard pressed to find many examples of projects that succeeded in spite of poor relationships. However developing successful collaborative relationships among diverse groups of individuals is a difficult and resource intensive process. The disproportionate amount of resources required to create de novo consortiums and cultivate new relationships is one limiting aspect of the common approach to conducting multi-center clinical trials. The Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NEXT) will provide common reusable resources that many clinical trials can leverage. This application requests funds to support the creation of a DCC at the University of Iowa. The DCC will support study design data collection data management project management clinical site monitoring quality management safety monitoring and statistical aspects of the proposed trial. The specific aims of the DCC application are to: 1) Provide study design and statistical leadership; 2) Develop and maintain a web-based distributed data entry system with the capability to quickly efficiently and accurately randomizesubjects and collect data generated by the studies conducted within the network; 3) Provide project management support for the studies conducted within the network; and 4) Provide access to study-wide and network information.  The DCC will provide a robust standardized and accessible infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols for conducting clinical trials in neuroscience. Additionally the proposed DCC infrastructure is explicitly designed to accommodate dynamically changing requirements that naturally occur in clinical trials (both planned and unplanned). The proposed DCC will provide more rapid evaluation of promising treatments in neuroscience and will be a model that can be replicated across a number of studies and diseases.","Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees;Collaborations;Communication;Communities;Conceptions;Conduct Clinical Trials;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Data Coordinating Center;Data Quality;Data Set;Databases;Development;Dictionary;Disease;Enrollment;Ensure;Environment;Epidemiologic Studies;Evaluation;Funding;Huntington Disease;Individual;Information Networks;Iowa;Leadership;Learning;Modeling;Monitor;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke;Neurobiology;Neurosciences;Online Systems;Phase;Positioning Attribute;Preparation;Procedures;Process;Production;Protocol Compliance;Protocols documentation;Publications;Quality Control;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Request for Applications;Research Design;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Safety Management;Statistical Data Interpretation;System;Universities;Visit;Well in self;clinical research site;data management;design;distributed data;experience;outreach;protocol development;success;tool;trial design;web portal;web site","Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NEXT)-DCC","The Network of Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NEXT) will provide infrastructure to facilitate rapid development and implementation of protocols in neuroscience.

"Aging; Genetics; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):""Proteinopathies"" diseases of protein misfolding and aggregation are debilitating age-related diseases such as ALS Alzheimer's Parkinson's and Huntington's Diseases for which there are currently no interventions to reduce cell dysfunction and death. Harnessing the cell's own protective responses to protein misfolding such as the heat shock response (HSR) dramatically ameliorates the toxic effects of protein aggregation in all animal models of proteinopathies. Recent studies have shown that the HSR of individual cells of an organism is under non-autonomous control of the nervous system. The objective of this proposal is to determine precisely how neurons control the HSR in another cell. We have identified a crucial element of this cytoprotective mechanism: thermosensory-induced serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) release is necessary and sufficient to induce the HSR in other cells and thereby suppress protein aggregation and misfolding. We show this by live imaging of HSF-1 the transcription factor responsible for the expression of protective heat shock protein (HSP) genes in combination with optogenetic excitation of specific neurons in intact animals. Using techniques developed in our laboratory we will investigate the inter-tissue signaling mechanisms by which sensory stress perception results in cytoprotection. The innovation of the proposed work is that it will elucidate in-depth for the first time a mechanism of cell non-autonomous control of the HSR. Aging results in the inevitable decline in an organism's ability to withstand stress. It is unclear whether decreases in the efficiency of stress signaling mechanisms themselves contribute to this aging-dependent impairment of stress responses. Our expertise in dissecting the mechanisms by which the neurosensory system signals stress to distal tissues and non-autonomously controls their response allows us a unique opportunity to address this question. Hypothesis: Thermosensory-induced release of 5-HT activates adaptive cellular stress responses that protect protein homeostasis. Aim 1. How do thermosensory (AFD) neurons elicit 5-HT release from serotonergic neurons? Aim 2. What inter-tissue stress signaling pathways are activated by 5-HT in responsive cells?      ","Address;Age;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Animal Model;Animals;CD2 Antigens;Cells;Cellular Stress Response;Cessation of life;Coupled;Cytoprotection;Disease;Distal;Drug Targeting;Elements;Functional disorder;Genes;Genetic Screening;Genetic Techniques;HSF1;Health;Heat shock proteins;Heat-Shock Response;Homeostasis;Human;Huntington Disease;Image;Impairment;Individual;Intervention;Laboratories;Life;Mammals;Messenger RNA;Nervous System control;Neuroglia;Neurons;Neurosecretion;Neurotransmitters;Organism;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Perception;Proteins;Resolution;Sensory;Serotonin;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Stress;System;Techniques;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Work;age related;biological adaptation to stress;innovation;neurosensory;neurotransmission;novel;optogenetics;protein aggregation;protein misfolding;public health relevance;response;transcription factor","Uncovering how serotonergic signaling non-autonomously regulates protein homeostasis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ""Proteinopathies"" diseases of protein misfolding and aggregation are debilitating age-related diseases such as ALS Alzheimer's Parkinson's and Huntington's Diseases for which there are currently no interventions to reduce cell dysfunction and death.

"Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and hypertension are serious public health concerns. Population studies indicate that at least two- thirds of the prevalence of hypertension can be directly attributed to obesity. Obesity-induced hypertension is associated with sympathetic overactivity and evidence indicates that signaling through both leptin receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor is critical for this process. However the underlying neural basis of this association remains incompletely understood. Our long-term goal is to delineate the neural circuits that mediate obesity- induced sympathetic overactivity and hypertension. The rationale for this proposed research is that understanding the specific brain leptin and melanocortin circuits that mediate sympathetic outflow and blood pressure will help to develop more selective pharmacologic strategies that will allow effective treatment of hypertension and obesity. We have recently identified a unique subpopulation of neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area that co-express both leptin receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor. The central hypothesis is that in the context of obesity and hyperleptinemia both leptin receptor and melanocortin-4 receptor signaling in this subpopulation of lateral hypothalamic area neurons is augmented to cause sympathetic overactivity and hypertension. In order to directly test the components of this hypothesis the following Specific Aims have been generated: 1) To determine if MC4R signaling in the LHA is necessary and sufficient to regulate renal SNA and mediates obesity-associated increases in blood pressure; and 2) To determine if LepR signaling in the LHA is necessary and sufficient to regulate renal SNA and mediates obesity-associated increases in blood pressure; and 3) To test if selective optogenetic modulation of activity of LHA LepR+ neurons regulates renal SNA and ameliorates obesity-associated increases in blood pressure. We will test if manipulating leptin and melanocortin signaling and neuronal activity in the LHA in the context of obesity affect sympathetic outflow and cardiovascular function. The proposed research is innovative because it will combine multiple state-of-the-art techniques including Cre/loxP optogenetics direct multi-fiber recording of sympathetic nerve activity and radiotelemetry measurement of blood pressure to test a novel brain circuit that contributes to obesity-induced sympathetic overdrive and hypertension in mice. The proposed research is significant because it will improve our understanding of the molecular and neural basis of obesity-induced hypertension and identifies novel therapeutic opportunities to effectively treat hypertension associated with the development of obesity. We believe that this work will contribute to a better understanding of how brain networks and signaling pathways lead to the development of neurogenic hypertension.      ","Adrenergic Fibers;Affect;Agonist;Animals;Beds;Blood Pressure;Blood Pressure Monitors;Body Weight;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;Chronic Disease;Congestive;Coupled;Cre-LoxP;Data;Development;Exhibits;Fiber;Genetic;Genetic Techniques;Goals;Heart failure;Homeostasis;Human;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;Kidney;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Lateral;Lateral Hypothalamic Area;Lead;Leptin;Measurement;Mediating;Melanocortin 4 Receptor;Metabolic;Molecular;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Nerve;Neurons;Obesity;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Physiological;Play;Population;Prevalence;Process;Public Health;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Research;Research Proposals;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Skeletal Muscle;Suid Herpesvirus 1;System;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Tissues;Work;awake;base;design;effective therapy;improved;in vivo;innovation;leptin receptor;mouse model;neural circuit;neurogenic hypertension;neurotransmission;normotensive;novel;novel therapeutics;optogenetics;public health relevance;receptor expression;relating to nervous system;selective expression;stroke","Lateral hypothalamic regulation of sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity-induced hypertension is a very common and serious chronic illness often accompanied by markedly increased sympathetic activity.

"Hematology; Infant Mortality; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","Neonatal anemia is the most commonly encountered hematologic problem among all neonates cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Project 1 seeks to better understand the pathophysiology and treatment of this challenging and important condition especially as it affects premature critically ill very low birth weight (VLBW) infants who require intensive laboratory blood monitoring leading to the need for multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (RBCTX). In the revised research strategy proposed in Aims 1 2 and 3 recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) will first be administered to 1.0 to 1.5 kg VLBW infants; then comprehensive pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data will be systematically gathered and analyzed to identify clinical and laboratory covariate parameters differentiating the infants based on their level of Epo responsiveness. Finally the Epo responsiveness predictors thus determined will be applied prospectively in the Aim 4 Study a 2 x 2 design in which VLBW infants will be identified as good or poor EPO responders based on the predictors and then randomly assigned to receive Epo treatment or no treatment. This will test the central hvpothesis of Project 1: RBCTX can be eliminated in the majority of good Epo responders by optimal administration of Epo but only marginal reductions in RBCTx will occur in the poor Epo responders. Project 1 challenges the prevailing thinking that the efficacy of Epo dosing in stimulating erythropoiesis is insufficient to eliminate the need for RBC transfusions in VLBW infants. Based on extensive preclinical and clinical PK/PD studies by our PPG team we contend that previous Epo treatment studies in VLBW infants were not able to realize the full potential of Epo to eliminate RBCTX (in contrast to the very successful use of Epo in adult renal failure patients) because previous VLBW studies were conducted 1) without Epo dosing individualized for the complexities of neonatal erythropoiesis and PK/PD of Epo and 2) without consistent criteria for RBC transfusion Epo dosing and patient enrollment. The overall impact of Project 1 will be significant and potentially transformative: the development of a personalized mechanism-driven approach built on sound principles will improve understanding of neonatal anemia and will be applicable to the care of premature anemic infants. Project 1 synergizes with other PPG groups by expanding knowledge: 1) of erythropoiesis and Epo's PD (Projects 3 and 4); and 2) of PK and PD modeling (thromobopoiesis in Project 2).","Adult;Affect;Algorithms;Biological Markers;Biotechnology;Birth Weight;Blood;Blood Cells;Caring;Characteristics;Clinical;Complex;Computer Simulation;Computers;Critical Illness;Data;Development;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Enrollment;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes;Erythropoiesis;Erythropoietin;Fetus;Functional disorder;Genetic Status;Gestational Age;Individual;Infant;Inflammation;Iron;Kidney Failure;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lead;Link;Longevity;Modeling;Monitor;Neonatal;Neonatal Anemia;Neonatal Intensive Care Units;Neonatal Thrombocytopenia;Outcome;Oxidative Stress;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Pharmacotherapy;Premature Infant;Production;Proteins;Randomized;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Subgroup;Testing;Thinking;Validation;Very Low Birth Weight Infant;base;burden of illness;cytokine;design;disability;evidence base;fetal;improved;individualized medicine;models and simulation;neonate;novel;pharmacodynamic model;pre-clinical;premature;recombinant human erythropoietin;sound","OPTIMIZED EPO TREATMENT OF NEONATAL ANEMIA","RELEVANCE Project 1 results confirming our hypothesis that PK/PD optimized Epo treatment is effective in eliminating RBC transfusions administered to a select sub-group of NICU infants will provide fundamental knowledge about neonatal anemia that will reduce the burden of illness and disability caused by this condition.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Hematology; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","Thrombocytopenia is after anemia the most common hematological problem among sick neonates affecting 20-35% of NICU patients. Platelet transfusions (PLTXs) are frequently given to affected neonates in an effort to reduce the incidence or severity of hemorrhages. Recently the FDA approved two novel thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics for the treatment of adults with immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Based on the duration and severity of thrombocytopenia up to 10% of thrombocytopenic neonates could also benefit from these agents. However their use in this population has been hampered by a lack of information about differences between neonates and adults with respect to the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics and toxicities of these agents and by our inability to predict the duration of neonatal thrombocytopenia. Our long term goal is to improve the treatment of thrombocytopenic neonates through the evidence-based use of PLTXs and TPO mimetics. Toward this goal we aim to complete the preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies necessary to guide the use of TPO mimetics in newborn infants. Our central hypothesis is that parameters generated through an advanced mathematical model of neonatal thrombopoiesis will enable us to identify neonates who will benefit from TPO mimetics but that the cellular molecular and pharmacodynamic responses of neonates will be different from those of adults. To test this hypothesis we have formulated the following Specific Aims: 1) To characterize the effects of TPO and two TPO mimetics romiplostim and eltrombopag on fetal neonatal and adult human megakaryocytes (MKs). 2) To establish the rates of platelet production at baseline and following the administration of romiplostim in newborn mice with thrombocytopenia; 3) To determine whether romiplostim and/or eltrombopag cross the blood-brain barrier; and 4) To develop clinically useful parameters to predict the duration of thrombocytopenia in neonates. These aims will be accomplished using cellular and molecular studies on primary human MKs (S.A. 1) novel murine models of neonatal thrombocytopenia (S.A. 2) serial cerebrospinal fluid studies in newborn lambs (S.A. 3) and mathematical models of neonatal thrombopoiesis (S.A. 4). The first 3 aims will lead to a better understanding of the neonatal responses to TPO mimetics and of the potential of these agents to cross the blood-brain barrier (this will be critical given the pro-apoptotic effects of TPO on neurons).

"Brain Disorders; Hematology; Infant Mortality; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion management includes the criteria used to determine when transfusion should occur in preterm infants. There is controversy regarding whether more restrictive or more liberal criteria would best serve the goal of optimal brain development. Although some studies have indicated that liberal transfusions may be neuroprotective our findings from the previous 4 years of this PPG indicate that liberal transfusions result in poor long-term brain development and this is particularly true for females. The overall aim of Project #3 is to evaluate the neurodevelopmental outcomes of differential transfusion practices from a mechanistic viewpoint. We hypothesize that liberal transfusion will result in poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to restrictive transfusion practices. Potential mechanisms explored for this phenomenon include inflammation and/or erythropoietin (Epo) suppression that result from liberal RBC transfusion. Cerebral white matter and sex effects will be of particular interest. Specific Aim 1 will be to measure the relationships between serum biomarkers (average hematocrit (HCT) iron ferritin c-reactive proteins cytokines and Epo) and brain structure (using MRI) in preterm infants that are randomized to either restricted or liberal transfusion. Biomarkers and MRI scan will be obtained during the NICU stay. Specific Aim 2 will examine the effects of differential transfusion on brain development using a longitudinal assessment of the same infants at 12 months and 24 months. Follow-up assessments will include a comprehensive battery of cognitive and developmental measures as well as a follow-up MRI scan. The current proposal is designed to 'extend' an NICHD Neonatal Research Network trial to evaluate the relationship between neonatal transfusion approach and neurodevelopmental outcome. This study is called the Impact of a Liberal Red Blood Cell Transfusion Strategy on Neurologically-lntact Survival of Extremely- Low-Birth-Weight Infants: The Transfusion and Brain Injury (TABI) Trial. The TABI protocol will be the foundation for recruitment of subjects our current proposal would extend the TABI by: 1) assessing transfusion status and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) as continuous measures rather than dichotomous measures; 2) use additional assessments that more sensitively and more specifically quantify brain structure and function; and 3) explore specific proposed mechanisms by which differential transfusion may impact brain development (inflammation and Epo suppression).","Anemia;Biological Markers;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain region;Cerebrospinal Fluid;Cerebrum;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive;Data;Deposition;Development;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythropoietin;Evaluation;Extremely Low Birth Weight Infant;Female;Ferritin;Foundations;Functional disorder;Goals;Hematocrit procedure;Hippocampus (Brain);Hospitalization;Infant;Inflammation;Intervention;Iron;Lead;MRI Scans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Multicenter Neonatal Research Network;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Neonatal;Neonatal Anemia;Neonatal Thrombocytopenia;Neurodevelopmental Impairment;Outcome;Premature Infant;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Published Comment;Randomized;Research;Role;Serum;Structure;Thalamic structure;Time;Tissues;Transfusion;brain morphology;brain volume;clinical practice;cytokine;design;follow-up;gray matter;inflammatory marker;interest;mouse model;premature;sex;white matter","PRETERM TRANSFUSIONS: BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OUTCOMES","Relevance Findings from the current proposal have a high likelihood of direct clinical impact: at a minimum results that show liberal transfusion practice leads to poorer neurodevelopmental outcome will have a direct impact on clinical practice.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Hematology; Infant Mortality; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","PROJECT SUMMARY  Anemia is a common medical condition in preterm infants. Previous studies generated from this Program Project Grant (PPG) showed that the degree of anemia contributes significantly to the neurodevelopmental outcomes of these individuals- particularly with respect to deficits in learning and memory. Anemia and its therapies (red blood cell transfusion and Erythropoietin (Epo) administration) expose the rapidly developing brains of premature neonates to potential neuropathologies. More severe anemia secondary to restrictive transfusion protocols risks brain hypoxia and iron deficiency (ID). Conversely liberal transfusion protocols place the brain at risk for toxicity from iron overload and suppression of endogenous Epo- a potential neuronal growth factor. Treatment with exogenous Epo may be neuroprotective but may also shunt limited neonatal iron reserves into red blood cells thereby restricting iron delivery to the brain and causing more severe brain ID. The hippocampus a major brain region underlying recognition learning and memory differentiates rapidly in the neonatal period. Proper structural differentiation requires adequate oxygen iron and growth factors. Neonatal ID anemia has particularly profound effects on the developing hippocampus affecting its genome metabolome structure intracellular signaling pathways electrophysiology and specific behavioral functions. These deficits manifest during the period of ID and remain into early adulthood in spite of iron repletion. Our outcome studies of premature infants with neonatal anemia have suggested that these infants have similar neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The goal of Project 4 is to provide experimental evidence in unique developmentally synchronized mouse models to establish mechanisms that underlie brain injury due to neonatal anemia and its treatments. The overall research aim of Project 4 is to evaluate the effects of phlebotomy-induced anemia and Epo treatment with or without supplemental iron between postnatal days (P) P3 and 12 on learning and memory. We will do this by assessing the behavioral function metabolome structure and neuronal mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling status of the mouse hippocampus during the period of anemia and again in young adulthood. mTOR is a highly conserved signaling cascade that senses changes in neuronal nutritional oxygen and growth factor status and responds by adjusting protein translation and actin polymerization rates which in turn determine neuronal structure and function. In Aim 1 we will use unique models generated by our laboratory to test whether phlebotomy-induced anemia and Epo treatment with low or high dose supplemental Fe impair recognition learning and memory behavior. In Aim 2 we will test whether these same experimental conditions alter the neurometabolome and structure of the hippocampus. In Aim 3 we will test hypotheses about how oxygen iron and Epo regulate kinases and genes in the mTOR pathway since the fundamental mechanisms by which neurons are dependent on oxygen iron and Epo for growth and development are not understood.","Actins;Address;Affect;Anemia;Animals;Area;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain Hypoxia;Brain Injuries;Brain region;Consultations;Data;Development;Differentiation and Growth;Dose;Electrophysiology (science);Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythrocytes;Erythropoietin;Exhibits;FRAP1 gene;Female;Functional disorder;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genome;Goals;Growth;Growth and Development function;Hippocampus (Brain);Hospitalization;Human;Hypoxia;Individual;Infant;Inflammation;Iron;Iron Overload;Iron deficiency anemia;Knowledge;Laboratories;Learning;Long-Term Effects;Measures;Mediating;Medical;Medical Care Team;Memory;Memory impairment;Metabolic;Metabolism;Modeling;Mus;Neonatal;Neonatal Anemia;Neonatal Thrombocytopenia;Neurons;Nutritional;Outcome;Outcome Study;Oxygen;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Phosphotransferases;Pre-Clinical Model;Premature Infant;Process;Program Research Project Grants;Progress Reports;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recognition (Psychology);Research;Rest;Risk;Risk Behaviors;Role;Secondary to;Severities;Shunt Device;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Site;Specimen;Structural defect;Structure;Subcellular structure;Testing;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transfusion;Translations;Venous blood sampling;base;behavioral outcome;cognitive function;critical period;emerging adult;fetal;iron deficiency;male;metabolome;mind control;mouse model;neonatal brain;neurogenesis;neuronal growth;neuronal metabolism;neuropathology;polymerization;postnatal;premature;premature neonates;research study;response;sensor;young adult","THE RoLE OF NEONATAL ANEMIA IN LEARNING AND MEMORY","RELEVANCE Preterm infants are at greater risk for poorer developmental outcomes compared to term infants especially with respect to learning and memory problems. While multiple factors during their hospitalization may influence the developmental outcomes of preterm infants few are under the control of the health care team. One potentially controllable factor however is the optimal treatment of neonatal anemia which affects nearly every preterm infant. Thus knowledge of the effect of anemia on areas of the brain involved in learning and memory is particularly relevant. The use of carefully controllable mouse models such as those generated by our group makes it possible to more precisely identify the effect of anemia and its treatment on the brain by controlling or eliminating confounding factors that are present in human studies. Identifying the effects of anemia and optimizing it's management in the mouse an animal whose brain structures for learning and memory are similar to humans will allow us to optimize the approaches and timing of anemia treatment in preterm infants.","NHLBI","9101831","8/5/2016","PAR-10-285","4P01HL046925-20","4","P01","HL","046925","20","","MONDORO, TRACI "," ","8/31/2018","Heart, Lung, and Blood Program Project Study Section[HLBP]","7945","1863083","GEORGIEFF, MICHAEL K.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016"," ","279543"," ","279543","0"," "," ",
"Clinical Research; Hematology; Infant Mortality; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Preterm, Low Birth Weight and Health of the Newborn","ABSTRACT Since the inception of this PPG 17 years ago the goal of Core A has remained constant: to maximize the scientific progress and productivity of each project by providing responsive and effective centralized support services. The services provided fall under the following categories: Administrative Statistical and Research Personnel for Clinical Studies. The objectives of Core A are to provide all PPG projects and Core B with:  1) the leadership oversight and administrative support essential to maximize program performance; 2) the statistical support required to plan conduct and analyze data for all PPG studies; and  3) the personnel support necessary to successfully conduct and complete all PPG clinical studies. Core A achieves these objectives by coordinating the use of resources services and personnel. We foresee and have prepared for new scientific/medical challenges and opportunities in our renewal as we:  1) expand our focus to include a new but related research interest - neonatal thrombocytopenia - to provide critically needed information about this common problem responsible for significant morbidity and health care costs;  2) add two new performance sites - Children's Hospital Boston and the University of Minnesota Children's Hospital - to draw on the expertise of physician-scientists performing research at these sites that is directly related to our PPG; and  3) add four new investigators and seven new consultants with most located at the new sites and others at Emory University the University of Cincinnati and the State University of New York at Buffalo.  The logistical challenges presented by the increase in complexity associated with our renewal are offset by enhanced opportunities for outstanding team-driven scientific progress and productivity. In the section ""/. Overview of Core A we list the new and continuing program investigators and consultants; in section ""//.

"No NIH Category available","The unifying theme of this PPG renewal is understanding the pathophysiology and establishing the optimal management of two of the most serious and frequently encountered conditions among critically ill premature infants: anemia and thrombocytopenia. Current treatment for these conditions relies largely on transfusion of red blood cells and plateletstherapies that remain controversial and incompletely investigated. Prior research by our PPG group and others has established that many aspects of the pathophysiology of the anemia and thrombocytopenia of prematurity are unique. However our understanding is incomplete. Hence the goals of our renewal are to further define the mechanisms that give rise to these pressing and related clinical conditions to optimize their treatment per such mechanistic knowledge and consequently to reduce both short- and long-term disabilities associated with these conditions. Our 4 interrelated projects whose objectives are directly relevant to our unifying theme include: Project 1 ""Optimized erythropoietin treatment of neonatal anemia"" PL JA Widness (and P Veng-Pedersen); Project 2 ""Pathogenesis and treatment of neonatal thrombocytopenia"" PL M Sola-Visner; Project 3 ""Preterm transfusions: brain structure/function outcomes"" PL PC Nopoulos; and Project 4 ""The role of neonatal anemia In learning and memory"" PL MK Georgieff. Core A (""Administrative statistical and research personnel"") and Core B (""Laboratory and database"" PL DM Mock) will provide support for all projects. To enhance effectiveness our program has expanded to involve four (vs. two) performance sites so that data can be shared among Projects 1 2 and 3 (i.e. data from the same infants will be used In studies at multiple sites). Our history of success conducting multisite research will be invaluable in coordinating studies across the various performance sites. Because our Program rests on a highly-qualified multidisciplinary group of new and experienced investigators our renewal program consists of unique and collaborative research teams capable of accelerating the acquisition of knowledge vital to the fields of neonatal anemia and thrombocytopenia. Over the past 17 years our productive PPG group (200 publications) has made a substantial impact on clinical practice and research in neonatal transfusion medicine and hematology. Our program embraces and exemplifies the synergistic P01 approach which has and will enable us to make more rapid progress than any of us could individually. With this renewal we are poised to continue to challenge paradigms and advance knowledge as we build on prior results and maximize collaboration.","Address;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Algorithms;Anemia;Area;Arkansas;Behavioral;Biological Markers;Biology;Biotin;Biotinylation;Birth;Blinded;Blood;Blood Platelets;Boston;Brain;Brain Injuries;Buffaloes;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cognitive;Collaborations;Communication;Consult;Critical Illness;Data;Databases;Dependence;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Dose;Drug Kinetics;Educational process of instructing;Effectiveness;Enrollment;Erythrocyte Transfusion;Erythropoiesis;Erythropoietin;Functional disorder;Funding;Genetic;Goals;Health Care Costs;Hematology;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Human Resources;Individual;Infant;Infection;Inflammation;Internet;Investigation;Iron;Knowledge;Knowledge acquisition;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Leadership;Learning;Location;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medicine;Memory;Memory impairment;Methods;Minnesota;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Neonatal;Neonatal Anemia;Neonatal Thrombocytopenia;Neurologic;Newborn Infant;Online Systems;Outcome;Oxygen;Pathogenesis;Pediatric Hospitals;Pharmacodynamics;Placebo Control;Platelet Transfusion;Play;Premature Infant;Productivity;Publications;Qualifying;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Replacement Therapy;Research;Research Personnel;Rest;Role;Schedule;Science;Sepsis;Services;Signal Pathway;Site;Social Class;Spottings;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Thrombocytopenia;Thrombopoiesis;Thrombopoietin;Time;Transfusion;Treatment Protocols;Universities;Venous blood sampling;Very Low Birth Weight Infant;Work;base;burden of illness;clinical practice;clinical research site;clinically significant;cognitive testing;cost;data management;design;disability;egg;evidence base;experience;follow-up;improved;in vivo;interest;iron supplement;mathematical model;meetings;member;metabolome;metabolomics;mimetics;mouse model;multidisciplinary;neonate;neurobehavioral;neuroimaging;novel;performance site;population based;preclinical study;premature;premature neonates;prevent;programs;response;success;symposium;treatment group;treatment strategy","Neonatal Anemia and Thrombocytopenia:  Pathophysiology and Treatment","The research proposed will enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of the 2 most important common and costly hematological conditions encountered in the NICU: anemia and thrombocytopenia.

"Assistive Technology; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Pediatric; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children who are hard of hearing (HH) have mild through moderately severe hearing loss. These children are at-risk for long-term developmental difficulties due to limitations in their access to the auditory information in their world and in particular limitations in their access to spoken communication. Many of these children now receive clinical hearing and speech/language services to address this risk; however there has been very little research that focused on these children. This research gap was addressed during the current funding period with a large cohort of preschool-aged HH children via the Outcomes of Children with Hearing Loss (OCHL) project. Our research to date indicates that some children and some domains of development are more susceptible than others to the presence of mild to severe hearing during the preschool years. Vulnerabilities were most evident in areas dependent on processing fine details in the linguistic input including syntax grammatical morphology phonology and meta-phonological skills. Vocabulary and pragmatic language skills (related to social cognition) also showed effects of hearing loss. Additionally wehave identified systematic effects of degree of hearing loss on speech and language outcomes as well as the protective effects of aided audibility on these outcomes. From this work we have begun to construct an account of the basis for the observed variability in outcomes of HH children as well as its impact on development. The proposed research will extend this inquiry into the early school years. Our aims in this research concern whether the communication vulnerabilities we have seen in the preschool years persist into the school years and contribute to academic difficulties as well as continued communication problems. We are also interested in whether the early intervention received in the preschool years protects these children from some of the negative outcomes associated with early hearing loss. Finally we plan to describe the special services and mainstream classroom environments these children find themselves in and whether these services and environments influence their outcomes. To accomplish this we will follow 276 HH children and 140 normal hearing (NH) classmates through 4th grade and obtain extensive information on their spoken language development and academic achievement. Additionally for the HH children we will obtain measures of services provided and their classroom environments during their 3rd and 4th grades. Also of the HH children 196 of them will have participated in our preschool longitudinal study and thus extensive information concerning hearing speech/language services and early interventions can be associated with these school age outcomes. This study will inform theories about the consequences of inconsistent access to auditory input for developmental outcomes. Furthermore our findings will provide empirical evidence to guide best practices by identifying early and concurrent risk and protective factors identifying contributions of school-based interventions and determining which children are at risk for late-emerging reading comprehension difficulties.","Academic achievement;Academic skills;Accounting;Acoustics;Address;Age;Age-Years;Area;Attitude;Auditory;Child;Clinical;Clinical Management;Communication;Complex;Comprehension;Control Groups;Data;Development;Early Intervention;Educational Curriculum;Effectiveness of Interventions;Environment;Evaluation;Evidence based practice;Face;Family Characteristics;Funding;Health;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Individual Differences;Instruction;Intervention;Knowledge;Language;Language Development;Lead;Learning;Linguistics;Long-Term Effects;Longitudinal Studies;Mainstreaming;Matched Group;Mathematics;Measures;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Morphology;Multivariate Analysis;Nursery Schools;Oral;Outcome;Performance;Policies;Problem Solving;Process;Prospective Studies;Reading;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Risk;School-Age Population;Schools;Services;Short-Term Memory;Speech;Testing;Vocabulary;Work;Writing;aged;base;cognitive ability;cohort;early childhood;educational atmosphere;elementary school;executive function;fourth grade;hearing impairment;insight;interest;longitudinal design;pedagogy;phonology;protective effect;reading comprehension;resilience;second grade;sharing data;skills;social;social cognition;syntax;teacher;theories;therapy design;third grade","Outcomes of School-Age Children who are Hard of Hearing","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will obtain critical information regarding the language and academic outcomes of a large group of children with mild to severe hearing loss in the school years.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Iowa Biosciences Advantage (IBA) program operates under the aegis of The University of Iowa (UI) Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) grant. Its mission is to identify and competitively train academically talented underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates who have aspirations for research careers in the biomedical behavioral and biophysical sciences. For these students the IBA program facilitates entry into doctoral programs by: 1) tailoring the plan of study for each studen to maximize academic performance 2) providing a competitive and relevant research training experience from among the vast bioscience research opportunities at the UI and 3) assuring access to a comprehensive four-year path focused on professional development. In the last funding period the percentage of IBA graduates matriculating into doctorate programs has increased from 11% to 15%. Initially our main difficulty was in the identification of undergraduate students with aspirations for careers in research versus the health professions. Despite the fact the mentored research is consistently ranked by the students as the most rewarding aspect of the program the length of time in graduate school and the inability to perform patient based research hindered their pursuit of doctoral degrees. In the proposed project period our goal is to expand on the successful initiatives currently in place in the IBA program and to further add a fast-track path to the doctorate and a Certificate program in Translational Sciences that are initiated by the IBA program but will be institutional in nature. I Specific Aim 1 IBA will ensure successful preparation for pre-doctoral training by fostering students' awareness of and interest in graduate education and academic/research careers and enhancing the success of each student's application to doctoral programs in the biosciences by focusing on both academic and research development. Specific Aim 2 will develop and implement a pilot for a fast track to the doctorate program that would facilitate early admission into and completion of a doctoral program in the biomedical behavioral or biophysical sciences at UI. This will entail allowing highly competitive IBA Scholars to enter a doctoral program in Microbiology or Biochemistry after their third year of undergraduate study simultaneously completing the undergraduate degree and the first year of a graduate degree. Specific Aim 3 will develop an undergraduate Translational Sciences Certificate program that would prepare students to transition from undergraduate research into doctoral programs focused on clinical and translational studies at CTSA-funded institutions or other institutions that conduct translational studies. Utilizing faculty and staff expertise in outreach selection undergraduate student development theory and research doctoral training T32-based and other research funding career development translational research responsible conduct in research mentoring and program evaluation the IBA will benchmark success with at least 60% of IBA graduates going directly into doctoral programs.","Academic support;Academy;Admission activity;Area;Authorship;Awareness;Bachelor&apos;s Degree;Back;Behavioral;Benchmarking;Biochemistry;Biological Sciences;Biomedical Research;Biophysics;Career Choice;Clinical Research;Development;Doctor of Philosophy;Doctor&apos;s Degree;Ensure;Event;Faculty;Fostering;Funding;Goals;Graduate Degree;Graduate Education;Grant;Health Occupations;Hour;Institution;Iowa;Length;Mentors;Microbiology;Minority;Mission;Nature;Participant;Patients;Performance;Postdoctoral Fellow;Preparation;Program Evaluation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Support;Research Training;Rewards;Schools;Students;Time;Training;Training Programs;Translational Research;Underrepresented Minority;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;base;bench to bedside;career;career development;certificate program;college;curriculum development;design;experience;faculty mentor;faculty research;graduate student;interest;matriculation;meetings;minority undergraduate;outreach;pre-doctoral;programs;research and development;responsible research conduct;skills;success;symposium;theories;translational study;undergraduate research;undergraduate student;underrepresented minority student","The University of Iowa IMSD: Iowa Biosciences Academy","The University of Iowa Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) is an undergraduate program that contributes to the national effort of increasing the numbers of underrepresented minority faculty investigators and students engaged in biomedical and behavioral and biophysical research.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drugs of abuse such as cocaine produce long-lasting synaptic adaptations that increase the compulsive nature of addiction undermine self-control and increase the likelihood of relapse. Identifying and understanding the molecules that regulate these synaptic changes may suggest novel therapies. Recently we found that acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and brain pH play critical roles in the synaptic plasticity thought tounderlie addiction. Our findings suggest that ASIC1a is activated during synaptic transmission in medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) a site firmly implicated in addiction-related behavior. Genetically deleting ASIC1a in mice led to a number of synaptic changes paralleling those previously observed following cocaine withdrawal. Consistent with these synaptic effects disrupting ASIC1a in mice throughout the body or specifically in the NAc increased conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine and to morphine indicating important behavioral consequences that generalize to multiple drugs of abuse. Confirming the NAc as a key site of ASIC1a action in cocaine-dependent behavior restoring ASIC1a expression to the NAc of ASIC1a-/- mice reversed the synaptic abnormalities and normalized cocaine CPP. We also tested synaptic and behavioral effects of ASIC1a in rats and found results similar to those in mice. In rats overexpressing ASIC1a in the NAc doubled the ASIC-mediated synaptic current and significantly reduced cocaine self- administration. Together these observations indicate that ASIC1a inhibits addiction-related behavior. Furthermore these results suggest the hypothesis that ASIC1a and brain pH might be targeted to reduce the synaptic changes underlying addiction and relapse. To test this hypothesis we propose to explore genetic and pharmacological approaches to increase ASIC1a function at synapses and to determine their ability to affect cocaine-related synaptic physiology and behavior in mice and rats. The planned studies capitalize on novel insight into the roles of ASICs and pH in synaptic transmission and take advantage of state-of-the-art electrophysiological approaches and an innovative collaboration between principal investigators with extensive experience in ASICs brain pH and drug-related behavior. Our planned behavioral analyses include models of craving/relapse using long-access cocaine self-administration in rats widely considered one of the best models of addiction because animals control their own drug intake thus facilitating assessment of various stages of drug-seeking behavior. Because ASIC1a structure and function in rodents are nearly identical to those in humans these studies will be highly relevant to the human brain. Moreover the knowledge gained through these experiments will inform innovative strategies to interrupt addictive behaviors by targeting ASICs and/or brain pH.","AMPA Receptors;ASIC channel;Acetazolamide;Acids;Addictive Behavior;Affect;Attenuated;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Buffers;Carbonic Anhydrase IV;Cocaine;Collaborations;Complement;Control Animal;Data;Dendritic Spines;Dependovirus;Drug Addiction;Drug abuse;Electrophysiology (science);Foundations;Frequencies;Genetic;Goals;Health;Human;Intake;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular Abnormality;Morphine;Mus;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;Nature;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Play;Principal Investigator;Rattus;Relapse;Research Personnel;Rodent;Role;Self Administration;Self-control as a personality trait;Site;Staging;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic Cleft;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Withdrawal;Work;addiction;behavior measurement;cocaine exposure;craving;drug of abuse;drug relapse;drug reward;drug seeking behavior;drug withdrawal;experience;extracellular;innovation;insight;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;overexpression;preference;receptor;research study","Modulation of Synaptic and Behavioral Measures of Addiction by Acid-sensing Ion Channels","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drugs of abuse produce long-lasting changes in synaptic physiology that increase drug-seeking behavior.

"Aging; Arthritis; Clinical Research; Osteoarthritis; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic painful disorder that is the most frequent cause of mobility disability in older people. The MOST study has been a major source of new knowledge about the course of this disease and factors that affect its course. Since the study began in 2003 it is increasingly recognized that by the time people develop chronic symptoms of knee OA they usually have advanced structural findings of disease on MRI. Findings such as meniscal tears malalignment and cartilage loss drive further structural deterioration and almost certainly limit prevention opportunities. We believe that prevention opportunities are likely to be greater if started in those who do not yet have severe continuous knee pain or advanced structural findings of disease. The functional impacts of knee OA occur in older people who experience multiple musculoskeletal comorbidities and preventing disablement from OA requires a broader perspective than a focus on a single knee. For example those with pain in one knee are at high risk of pain in other lower extremity musculoskeletal regions and even if the knee is replaced they may ultimately need treatment for pain in other joints developing as a consequence of the first joint affected. Also in additionto functional loss persons with OA experience buckling falls and constraints in their involvement with the outside environment. We suggest there are opportunities to develop treatments and disease prevention strategies that have been unexplored and that by using new technologies and focusing on persons at a milder or earlier disease stage than previous studies we can identify such opportunities. We propose to recruit a new mild disease cohort and continue to study the existing MOST cohort to identify new risk factors for disease and to study consequences of disease. Our goal is to find new strategies to prevent disease at an early stage and to limit the impact of disease once it has occurred.","Acute;Address;Affect;Age;Animal Model;Arthritis;Biomechanics;Bone Density;Calcium;Cartilage;Chronic;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Degenerative polyarthritis;Deposition;Deterioration;Development;Disease;Elderly;Employee Strikes;Environment;Evaluation;Frequencies;Gait;Goals;Health;Heel;Hip region structure;Inflammation;Iowa;Joints;Knee;Knee Osteoarthritis;Knee joint;Knowledge;Lead;Lower Extremity;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Measures;Muscle Weakness;Musculoskeletal;Outcome;Pain;Pain management;Persons;Prevention;Prevention strategy;Recruitment Activity;Risk;Risk Factors;Sensory;Severities;Source;Staging;Symptoms;Techniques;Testing;Time;Walking;age related;base;bone;chronic pain;cohort;disability;disorder prevention;experience;falls;functional loss;high risk;insight;joint injury;knee pain;loss of function;member;new technology;novel;persistent symptom;prevent","Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST) Second Renewal: Iowa Clinical Center","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Knee osteoarthritis which causes chronic knee pain affects at least 12% of persons age 60 and over and is the most common cause of disability in elders yet little is available to treat or prevent this disease.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application is to support the further training and research activities of Dr. Amy L. Conrad in the neurobiology of cognition and the application of this research to patients with non-syndromic oral clefts. Dr. Conrad is a pediatric psychologist trained in the assessment of developmental learning and attention disorders. She has worked on research projects investigating cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate as well as other pediatric conditions. Recent work has hypothesized abnormal brain development as a potential primary factor in cognitive and behavioral skills within these children. This opens a new venue of research in cognitive skills. While her training in psychology and learning disabilities is extensive her education in neurobiology and imaging has been limited. In order to appropriately investigate neurodevelopment in subjects with non-syndromic cleft she has the short term goals to: 1) obtain in-depth training in neurobiology/development 2) obtain training in the application and interpretation of neuroimaging in connection with cognition and 3) extend her education in statistics. This will be achieved through coursework directed readings focused lectures/conferences and mentorship by professionals with strong backgrounds in neurodevelopment imaging and statistics. Through the research project and short-term learning goals Dr. Conrad will progress toward her long-term goal of evaluating neurodevelopment in children with various disorders through assessment and imaging procedures and contributing to effective intervention/care/treatment plans. Oral clefts are among the most common congenital malformation and the majority of these occur in isolation without a known genetic cause. Research has reported a high incidence of specific learning disabilities (most notably language or reading deficits) among this population. These disabilities while not in the range of Intellectual Dysfunction do result in academic achievement problems and may be related to later low college entry rates. Recent work has suggested that these outcomes may be due to abnormal brain structure and function rather than environmentally influenced. The proposed study will evaluate reading proficiency in subjects with non-syndromic cleft of the lip and/or palate and investigate links to previous hypothesized areas of influence (i.e. early hearing and speech) cognitive skills (i.e. phonemic awareness rapid labeling orthographic awareness visual/verbal memory and attention) and neurocircuitry involved (as related to previous research on dyslexia). The increased understanding of these skills and the factors influencing them will improve early identification treatment plans and will guide appropriate accommodations.","Academic achievement;Achievement;Adolescent;Adult;Affect;Americas;Area;Attention;Awareness;Behavioral;Bilateral;Brain;Caring;Child;Childhood;Cleaved cell;Cleft Lip;Cognition;Cognitive;Cognitive deficits;Complex;Comprehension;Congenital Abnormality;Control Groups;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Dyslexia;Early identification;Education;Etiology;Exhibits;Face;Financial compensation;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Genetic;Goals;Health;Hearing;Image;Imaging Techniques;Impairment;Incidence;Inferior frontal gyrus;Intervention;Label;Language;Language Disorders;Learning;Learning Disabilities;Left;Life;Link;Live Birth;Measures;Medical;Memory;Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award;Mentorship;Modeling;Names;Neurobiology;Occipital lobe;Orthography;Otitis Media;Outcome;Palate;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Phenocopy;Plant Roots;Population;Predictive Factor;Psychologist;Psychology;Reading;Reading Disabilities;Reporting;Research;Research Activity;Research Project Grants;Schools;Specificity;Speech;Structure;Symptoms;Syndrome;System;Training;Training Activity;Visual;Work;base;boys;cognitive development;cognitive function;cognitive skill;college;craniofacial;diagnostic accuracy;diagnostic screening;disability;effective intervention;hearing impairment;improved;lectures;lexical;neural circuit;neurodevelopment;neuroimaging;neuropsychological;oral cleft;phonological awareness;reading ability;reading difficulties;skills;sound;statistics;symposium;theories;treatment planning","Training in Neuroimaging of Cognitive Development in Craniofacial Diagnoses","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: High incidence of specific learning disabilities has been reported within the non-syndromic clefting population.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hebbian learning is basis of neuronal plasticity and its effect can best be seen in the induced ocular dominance columns in three eyed frogs where retina ganglion cell axons segregate from each other driven by induced and spontaneous activity. We have developed a new model the three eared frog model which allows us to induce vestibular dominance column depending on the orientation and thus stimulation of the grafted ear and have further developed our three- eared model to uncouple linear and angular acceleration and observe the effects on the vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR). In addition we can use the single pair of Mauthner cells to visualize the segregation of afferents from two ears at the level of a single cell. Aim1 will combine ear transplantations with various colored fluorescentproteins to image segregation of different semicircular canals in the vestibular nucleus and on Mauthner cell dendrites. In addition we can observe the effects of motor output by monitoring the VOR in animals with tandem aligned and misaligned semicircular canals. In Aim 2 this novel model will be utilized to dissect the significance of all activity in this process. Specifically uing the newly developed CRISPER technique we will delete a gene that has been identified as producing an essential protein for the docking of synaptic vesicles. Without such docking neither spontaneous nor induced activity will be propagated through the nervous system. We will test in specific combinations of the frogs whether the lack of activity in the transplanted ear or in the host or both is particularly important to drive the afferent segregation process. Combined these two aims will establish that activity is an essential factor for inner ear afferent segregation andwill establish the three-eared frog model as a new model to understand those plasticity processes at a cellular level using the only neuron that can be identified in the vertebrate central nervous system the Mauthner cell as an example.      ","Acceleration;Affect;Agar;Animals;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Auditory;Axon;Brain;Brain Stem;Cells;Cerebellum;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Cochlear structure;Color;Cues;Defect;Dendrites;Dependence;Development;Docking;Dyes;Ear structure;Embryo;Epithelium;Equilibrium;Esthesia;Eye;Eye Movements;Fiber;Financial compensation;Genes;Genome;Goals;Image;Implant;Individual;Label;Labyrinth;Learning;Left;Light;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Monitor;Motor Neurons;Motor output;Natural regeneration;Nervous system structure;Neuraxis;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Ocular dominance columns;Organ;Outcome;Play;Process;Proteins;Rana;Reflex action;Reporting;Research;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Role;Semicircular canal structure;Sensory;Sorting - Cell Movement;Spinal Cord;Synapses;Synaptic Vesicles;System;Tadpoles;Techniques;Tectum Mesencephali;Testing;Time;Transplantation;Vestibular nucleus structure;Visual Fields;Visual system structure;Work;base;ganglion cell;hindbrain;novel;public health relevance;research study;sample fixation;segregation;sensory system;spiral ganglion;tool;vesicular release","Three-eared frogs: A tool to dissect ear connection mechanisms","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In analogy to three-eyed frogs we have generated three-eared frogs that demonstrate afferent fiber segregation into vestibular dominance columns.

"Diabetes; Nutrition; Obesity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The alarming worldwide increase in obesity - together with a surge in associated insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) - follows marked changes in diet and physical activity over the past generation. However relationships between diet obesity and IR are complex. It is now evident that obesity and IR are strongly associated with a chronic inflammatory state which in turn perpetuates metabolic dysregulation in a self-amplifying loop. We and others recently identified an unexpected role for the immune receptor CD40 expressed by CD8 T cells in regulating inflammation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) obesity and IR. There is thus is a critical need to understand this newly recognized regulatory role for CD40. Our long-term goal is to define the biological role of CD40 expressed by CD8 T cells in chronic inflammation. The objective of the proposed project is to determine how CD40 regulates CD8 T cell function in the pathogenesis of VAT inflammation and IR. Our working hypothesis is that CD8 T cells are recruited to the VAT by adipokines and cytokines where they in turn recruit and activate inflammatory macrophages. In this inflammatory environment CD40 is upregulated on CD8 T cells which restrains the development of VAT inflammation and metabolic dysregulation by limiting T cell activation and hence further macrophage activation. We will test this hypothesis via the following experimental Aims: 1) How do cell-cell interactions and T cell activation status in the VAT mediate the regulatory role of CD40 in obesity and IR? 2) How does CD40 regulate the functions of CD8 T cells in the VAT to protect against inflammation obesity and IR? The expected outcome of these studies to determine the mechanisms by which CD40 mediates protection from chronic VAT inflammation that exacerbates obesity and development of IR knowledge that will serve as an important basis for translational studies in human adipose tissue and development of new approaches to combat obesity-induced IR and type 2 diabetes.      ","Acute;Adipose tissue;Autoimmune Diseases;Behavior;Biological;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cell Communication;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Complex;Conflict (Psychology);Data;Development;Diet;Disease;Environment;Generations;Goals;Health;High Fat Diet;Human;Immune;Immunologic Receptors;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Insulin Resistance;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Knowledge;Macrophage Activation;Mediating;Metabolic;Mission;Mus;Nature;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obese Mice;Obesity;Organism;Outcome Study;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Physical activity;Play;Process;Public Health;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Research;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Source;T-Cell Activation;T-Lymphocyte;TNFRSF5 gene;Testing;United States;United States National Institutes of Health;Visceral;Work;adaptive immunity;adipokines;base;combat;cytokine;exhaustion;expectation;improved;macrophage;migration;novel strategies;pathogen;public health relevance;response;translational study","CD40 as a regulator of CD8 T cell activation in obesity and adipose tissue inflammation","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it investigates a new mechanism for ameliorating inflammatory processes that contribute to obesity insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes which are major and growing health problems in the United States.

Depression affects 24% of older adults in assisted living (AL) settings but rates of recognition and treatment are low and underscore the need for alternative depression prevention and treatment methods in AL. A novel and promising intervention is a computerized cognitive training program known as Road Tour which has shown serendipitous benefits for reducing depression symptoms and the onset of suspected clinical depression consistent with Beck's model of cognitive depression. As a self-directed user-friendly ""game"" Road Tour overcomes common attitudinal and resource-related barriers that impede treatment in AL settings and holds considerable promise for interrupting the potential downward spiral of depression-related disability for 1 million AL elders.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate th effect of Road Tour on processing speed depression symptoms and suspected clinical depression and depression-related comorbidities among AL residents in Iowa. We will use a two-arm parallel RCT comparing Road Tour training to attention control training using computerized crossword puzzles among 300 adults 60 years old or older. We will actively engage 15-30 AL facilities as study partners who implement the training at their sites and assist with the evaluation process. RE-AIM methods will be used to develop AL-specific recruitment and enrollment protocols educate AL staff about the study and oversee computerized training by participating residents as well as their family members and AL staff. Our three specific aims are to: (1) establish the effect of Road Tour on improving cognitive processing speed in AL; (2) evaluate the effect of Road Tour on reducing depressive symptoms and the risk of onset of suspected clinical depression in AL; and (3) evaluate the effect of Road Tour on the depression-related health outcomes of anxiety pain and HRQoL in AL. Participants will receive 10 hours of computerized training over 5-6 weeks and 4 hours of booster training at months 5 and 11. Outcomes are the UFOV for speed of processing (Aim 1) the CESD-12 and PHQ-9 for depressive symptoms and suspected clinical depression (Aim 2) and the SF-36 for HRQoL the BPI for pain and GAD-7 for anxiety (Aim 3). Data will be collected using telephone interviews at baseline post-training (6-8 weeks) and at 26- weeks and 52-weeks. Each person will serve as their own control in linear panel analyses that use GEE to correct for clustering as well as general linear mixed effects models. This study is the first step in evaluating depression-related outcomes of using Road Tour in AL settings. Subsequently we will replicate the study while collecting the appropriate biomarkers and fMRIs to identify the precise mechanisms of action.

"Biotechnology; Genetic Testing; Genetics; Human Genome; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The technological and computational breakthroughs in the decade since the sequencing of the human genome have provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the etiology of complex human diseases. Notably the diminishing cost of next-generation sequencing means that it is now possible for researchers to obtain complete genome sequence information on thousands of diseased individuals. However major statistical questions remain about optimal design and analysis of studies using next-generation sequencing data to study the contribution of rare variation to common diseases. At the foundation of many such questions is the lack of power for single marker rare variant tests of association motivating the development of many potentially more powerful variant-set based tests which aggregate evidence from several individual variants into a single test statistic. Current and newly proposed variant-set based tests which attempt to address large variant situations vary in how they combine and weight variants leading to poorly understood differences in performance under different genetic models. Much of the current focus is on developing an all-around ""best"" rare variant test typically through assessment on simulated data. Regardless of which test--or more likely tests--emerge as optimal several challenges will remain toward applying these methods to real imperfect sequence data and then inferring underlying genetic architecture based on a statistically significant test result. Thus rather thanfocus exclusively on novel test development our research will center on gaining a deeper understanding of the behavior of rare variant set tests the realistic application of these tests and the development of methods to decompose significant test statistics to gain information that can guide future studies. We will pay specific attention to the interplay of various underlying disease models test statistics and study designs. This work will provide a critical step towards successfully identifying rare risk variants in future sequencing experiments and translating the results into public health practice. To achieve these goals we propose the following specific aims: We will (1) develop a framework to understand the behavior of rare variant set tests (2) evaluate rare variant set tests in the presence of imperfect data and (3) develop post-hoc analyses to identify causal variants and inform replication study design. We will conduct the research using a combination of analytic computational and simulation approaches. Additionally the work we will perform addresses the three main goals of NIH's R15 program: (a) to conduct meritorious research that will (b) strengthen the research environment of the liberal arts college where the research will be conducted while (c) exposing undergraduate students to statistical genetics research. With this last goal in mind the fourth aim of our proposal is to provide research experiences to undergraduate students when conducting aims 1 2 and 3.      ","Academic Research Enhancement Awards;Address;Architecture;Arts;Attention;Award;Behavior;Complex;Computer Simulation;Computer software;Counseling;Data;Data Set;Development;Disease;Disease model;Environment;Etiology;Eye;Fatty Acids;Foundations;Future;Gene Frequency;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Research;Genetic screening method;Genome;Genotype;Goals;Hereditary Disease;Human Genome;Hypertension;Individual;Lead;Light;Methods;Mind;Modeling;Performance;Phenotype;Public Health Practice;Publications;Research;Research Design;Research Personnel;Sample Size;Students;Technology;Test Result;Testing;Translating;Uncertainty;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Weight;Work;base;case control;college;cost;cost effective;data modeling;design;experience;genetic association;genetic variant;genome sequencing;human disease;human genome sequencing;insight;journal article;method development;next generation sequencing;novel;novel strategies;performance tests;programs;prospective;public health relevance;rare variant;research study;risk variant;simulation;statistics;technological innovation;tool;undergraduate student;vector","Analyzing the behavior and interpreting the results of gene based tests of rare variant association","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The number of genetic association studies seeking to identify genetic variants that predispose to human diseases continues to grow.

"Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Malaria; Malaria Vaccine; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related; Vector-Borne Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malarial disease caused by Plasmodium species remains an unresolved global health burden that impacts >40% of the world's population. Although the availability of insecticide treated bed nets and antimalarial drugs has reduced the incidence and severity of malaria in some regions ~200000000 cases still occur annually with ~850000 fatalities in 2013. Thus vaccines to prevent malaria remain an as yet unrealized but critical goal to combat this global threat.  As shown in our preliminary data only some of Plasmodium antigens that elicit CD8 T cell responses were targets of CD8 T cell mediated sterilizing immunity. Aim 1 will address the mechanisms that determine whether a specific Plasmodium antigen is the target of effective protection by memory CD8 T cells. Information generated from this aim will provide a practical basis to select new candidate antigens from the expressed pool of ~5000 ORF for evaluation as subunit vaccines to protect against human malaria.  Importantly despite repeated exposures sterilizing immunity (defined as prevention of blood-stage parasitemia after sporozoite infection) does not develop in individuals living in malaria endemic areas. Indeed our preliminary data reveal both numerical and functional impairment of memory CD8 T cells generated during malaria infection. In aim 2 we will use our newly developed tool-chest including TCR-retrogenic mice specific for recently identified Plasmodium antigens to determine how memory CD8 T cells generated after malaria infection are numerically and functionally impaired.  Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms underlying protective CD8 T cell immunity to liver- stage Plasmodium infection in order to aid in the rational development of effective vaccines. SA 1. Determine why some but not all Plasmodium antigens are targets of protective CD8 T cells. SA2. Determine the mechanism(s) by which Plasmodium infection results in compromised memory CD8 T cell populations.        ","Address;Africa South of the Sahara;Antigen Targeting;Antigens;Antimalarials;Area;Artemisinins;Attenuated;Award;Beds;Bite;Blood;CD8B1 gene;Cellular biology;Cessation of life;Chest;Child;Culicidae;Data;Development;Disease;Dose;Evaluation;Frequencies;Funding;Generations;Goals;Human;Immune response;Immunity;Immunization;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Insecticides;Knowledge;Life;Liver;Malaria;Malaria Vaccines;Mediating;Memory;Mus;Open Reading Frames;Parasite resistance;Parasitemia;Parasites;Pharmacotherapy;Plasmodium;Population;Prevention;Primates;Principal Investigator;Radiation;Research;Role;Severities;Southeastern Asia;Sporozoites;Staging;Subunit Vaccines;System;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Vaccination;Vaccines;artemisinine;base;circumsporozoite protein;combat;design;functional disability;global health;improved;malaria infection;prevent;programs;public health relevance;success;tool;vector","Memory CD8 T cell immunity to Plasmodium liver stage infec","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much emphasis in the field of subunit vaccines for malaria has been placed on improving the vector systems for antigen-delivery and these empirical approaches are likely to improve the existing delivery platforms and potentially reveal new platforms.

"Pediatric","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is critical to the future of pediatric cardiology that talented clinician-scientists continue to be fostered and encouraged to conduct research related to childhood cardiovascular disorders. This proposal requests a continuation of the University of Iowa's pediatric cardiology Institutional Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA established in 1978. The goal of this proposal is to foster multidisciplinary research training for three MD and MD/PhD postdoctoral trainees per year in clinical basic science or population research. The two- to three-year training program will serve as a foundation for a career in academic pediatric cardiology. A diverse group of mentors from clinical basic science public health and engineering departments use state-of-the-art techniques to explore specific questions in genetics molecular and cellular biology physiology cardiovascular imaging and epidemiology. The co-Program Directors and the Internal Executive Committee of the Training Program guides trainees through the early stages of selecting a mentor or mentor team and choosing a research discipline and monitors their progress during training. Trainees attend structured lectures and group discussions on many of the aspects needed for successful academic careers. Attention is given to career development with time available for interaction with other scientists at local and national meetings and manuscript and grant preparation. Since its inception our program has trained 46 pediatric cardiologists to study diverse topics from cardiac development and ontogenesis to the prevention of childhood obesity. After completing this program nearly 85% took academic appointments and a significant number (46%) continued their research interests by obtaining NIH funding (N=21). This proposal requests ongoing support of our program which 1) recruits talented applicants who desire a career in academic pediatric cardiology with an emphasis on research and 2) fulfills the recommendation of the NIH Task Force to encourage and support clinicians interested in becoming independent investigators of pediatric cardiovascular diseases. Relevance: Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect. Increasing our understanding of the origins and treatments of cardiac abnormalities children and adolescents requires that we continue to train talented clinician scientists in pediatric cardiology. The goal of this proposal is to continue funding for  program with a long track record of training researchers in pediatric cardiology.","Pediatric cardiology;Research Training;Training Programs","Research Training Program In Pediatric Cardiology","PROJECT NARRATIVECongenital heart disease is the most common birth defect.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Diagnostic Radiology; Neurosciences; Patient Safety; Radiation Oncology","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Image-guided molecularly-targeted peptide receptor radio-therapy (PRRT) provides superior response rates in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) compared to any treatments currently available; yet it is not available for patients in theUnited States. Our proposal seeks to remedy this situation by developing standardized methods for [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT and for dosimetry-guided PRRT using [90Y]DOTATOC. INDs generated for initial clinical trials will be made freely available through the Society of Nuclear Medicine Clinical Trials Network leading to submission of New Drug Applications (NDA) by our industry partners Eckert-Zeigler (EZ) and Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals (MIP). The end result will be to make [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT and [90Y]DOTATOC PRRT widely available in the US for patients with NETs.  NET incidence has increased 5-fold over the last 30 years but there is currently no curative treatment for the majority of these patients. Surgery can be curative in patients who are diagnosed early but is limited by the fact that 80% of patients have inoperable metastases at diagnosis with a 5-year survival rate <30%.  Our preliminary data showing the first [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CTs in the US demonstrate superior imaging sensitivity and specificity compared to FDA approved Octreoscan for detection of primary and metastatic lesions. These findings strongly support our proposal to translate combined functional and anatomical imaging using [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT to the clinical arena for diagnosis staging and quantitative measurement of response to therapy in patients with NETs. 68Ga has advantages for clinical use because it can provide PET resolution without the need for a cyclotron; however concerns about manufacturer ability to provide generator technology meeting regulatory compliance has slowed FDA acceptance in the US. Our strong preliminary data generated with GMP DOTATOC (MIP) and a gallium generator (EZ) demonstrate that [68Ga]DOTATOC can now be reliably prepared using disposable GMP compliant cassette-based kits (EZ) thereby making clinical [68Ga]DOTATOC possible within the framework of US regulatory requirements.  No controlled trials have examined the potential of quantitative measurement of response to therapy using [68Ga]DOTATOC and no study has combined these efforts in a multisite prospective standardized trial that could advance these patient care regimens to widespread acceptance in the US. According to the definition of innovation in PAR-10-169 the proposed research is innovative because it develops an optimized and standardized proposal for image-guided PRRT using [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT for diagnosis staging and selection of patients that can benefit most from [90Y]DOTATOC therapy. This contribution is significant because it will identify the effects of radiopharmaceutical formulation characteristicson the relative effectiveness of the [68Ga]DOTATOC and [90Y]DOTATOC drug products and will also result in a standardized platform to accelerate translation of PRRT to multi-institutiona clinical trials that will be required for widespread availability in the US. We know of no other Academic-Industry partnership that is capable of bringing [68Ga]DOTATOC PET/CT image-guided [90Y]DOTATOC therapy to the US for patients with NETs.","90Y;Adult;Affinity;Algorithms;Alternative Therapies;Award;Binding;Caring;Characteristics;Chelating Agents;Child;Cities;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Network;Cyclotrons;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diarrhea;Discipline of Nuclear Medicine;Dose;Drug resistance;Early Diagnosis;Effectiveness;Excretory function;FDA approved;Family;Flushing;Formulation;Future;Gallium;Image;Imaging Techniques;In 111 Pentetreotide;Incidence;Indium-111;Industry;Iowa;Kidney;Kidney Neoplasms;Label;Lead;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Manufacturer Name;Measurement;Measures;Medical center;Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Target;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Octreotide;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ;Patient Care;Patient Monitoring;Patient Selection;Patients;Pentetic Acid;Peptide Receptor;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Positron;Preparation;Primary Lesion;Procedures;Production;Progression-Free Survivals;Protocols documentation;Radiation;Radiation therapy;Radioisotopes;Radionuclide therapy;Radiopharmaceuticals;Regimen;Reporting;Research;Resolution;Sensitivity and Specificity;Societies;Somatostatin;Somatostatin Receptor;Staging;Survival Rate;Systemic Therapy;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Trials;Time;Toxic effect;Translating;Translations;United States;United States Department of Veterans Affairs;Universities;Variant;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;chemotherapy;contrast enhanced;control trial;cost effective;curative treatments;cytotoxic radiation;design;dosimetry;evidence base;image guided;image guided therapy;imaging agent;improved;industry partner;innovation;insight;instrumentation;meetings;molecular imaging;mortality;neoplastic cell;novel therapeutics;prospective;receptor;reduce symptoms;response;standard of care;targeted imaging;targeted treatment;tomography;treatment response;tumor;uptake","Image-guided Diagnosis and Therapy of Neuroendocrine Tumors","Image-guided molecularly-targeted peptide receptor radio-therapy (PRRT) provides superior response rates in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) compared to any treatments currently available; yet it is not available for patients in theUnited States.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Physical Activity; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low-income children and children of obese parents are at high risk of obesity. Effective interventions are needed to target these families to improvethe health of the parents and prevent obesity in the children. The hypothesis is that an intervention that combines engagement of community organizations motivational interviewing (MI a technique proven to help people set goals that are personally meaningful) and resource mobilization will change diet and physical activity habits among disadvantaged families. This proposal grew from an established community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnership between the research team and community organizations that serve high minority (45-55%) low-income populations. Partners include a community health center a food pantry network a work-force training program and other agencies. These partners designed and implemented a successful pilot project on which this proposal is based. The specific aims of this proposal are 1)to evaluate the efficacy of a family-targeted obesity intervention based on MI and resource-mobilization. Hypotheses: In comparison to control families families participating in the intervention will demonstrate a) a reduction in BMI for adults b) an increase in minutes of moderate physical activity and decreased sedentary time for both adults and children (accelerometer) and c) a reduction in the number of obesity risk behaviors and an increase in obesity prevention behaviors among children. 2) To examine the mediators of intervention effects. 3) identify the types of resources needed most often by intervention families to support lifestyle change. This randomized controlled trial includes 260 low-income families that contain at least one obese adult and one normal or overweight child between 6 and 12. The 12-month intervention has two elements. 1) A health coach will use MI to help families explore ambivalence toward and motivations for change and set goals for improving diet and physical activity. 2) To support goals families will be connected with community agencies that can assist with general (e.g. financial) and goal specific resources (e.g. food physical activity opportunities). Collaboration between organizations will streamline referrals maximize resources and facilitate access. Control families will get a basic screen for needs and information about available community resources. Outcomes are measured at baseline 6 12 and 18 months. This intervention is innovative in that it 1) focuses on lifestyle changes for the entire family and measures outcomes in adults and children 2) combines MI focused on the entire family and community resource referrals specific to family needs and goals for change 3) partners community organizations to coordinate resources for families and 4) involves partners in all research phases via a CBPR approach. This contribution will be significant because the proposed intervention if successful can be replicated elsewhere and adapted to the local resource environment to address adult obesity and prevent childhood obesity in a high-risk population. The study will also identify the types of resources low-income families need to change diet and physical activity.","Accelerometer;Address;Adult;Age;Behavior;Behavioral;Child;Child Behavior;Child Rearing;Collaborations;Communities;Community Health Centers;Counseling;Diet;Disadvantaged;Elements;Environment;Family;Family member;Food;Goals;Habits;Health;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare;Hour;Income;Individual;Intervention;Life;Life Style;Low Income Population;Low income;Measures;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Minority;Moderate Exercise;Motivation;Obesity;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Overweight;Parents;Participant;Phase;Physical activity;Physical activity scale;Pilot Projects;Population;Poverty;Prevalence;Prevention;Preventive Intervention;Public Health;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recruitment Activity;Research;Resources;Risk Behaviors;Self Efficacy;Techniques;Testing;Time;Training Programs;Weight;Work;base;behavior change;community based participatory research;community organizations;design;diet and exercise;effective intervention;empowered;expectation;food resource;good diet;group intervention;high risk;improved;improved outcome;innovation;intervention effect;moderate-to-vigorous physical activity;motivational enhancement therapy;nutrition;obesity in children;obesity prevention;obesity risk;obesity treatment;prevent;programs;screening;sedentary;successful intervention;targeted agent","Family obesity intervention: Motivational Interviewing and community support","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The increasing prevalence of obesity is a public health concern and creative approaches are needed to prevent and treat obesity particularly for low-income children with obese parents.

Veterans who have painful conditions often report high analgesic and prescription medication use including opioids. The combination of MSK pain mental health conditions and frequent analgesic use is a rising concern in terms of disability work productivity quality of life and the risk of overuse and overdose from narcotics.Veterans often use complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) including chiropractic for MSK complaints mental health concerns. However few studies have addressed the role of chiropractic care for veterans within Veterans Health Administration (VHA) settings or how such services might be integrated seamlessly into existing VHA clinical practice guidelines physical and mental health screening and treatment programs or pain management approaches. To address this gap in health services we propose a mixed-methods approach to develop integrative care pathways for the care of veterans with co-morbid musculoskeletal pain and anxiety depression or PTSD. We will accomplish the following four Aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop an integrative care model that includes doctors of chiropractic in multidisciplinary teams treating patients with MSK pain and mental health co-morbidities in the VHA based on the COCOA model; Specific Aim 2: Tailor existing chiropractic guidelines and best practices to interlink with current VHA pain management initiatives through a consensus building process; Specific Aim 3: Conduct a one-arm pilot clinical trial of this integrative care model including doctors of chiropractic in 20 veterans aged 55 and older with MSK pain and mental health co-morbidities to assess the feasibility acceptability safety tolerability and target outcomes for  future randomized controlled trial; Specific Aim 4: Revise the study protocol based upon pilot findings and submit a competitive research proposal for a fully-powered effectiveness study to NIH at the end of the study period. In summary the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has implemented progressive programs for both pain and mental health management. However a gap exists in our knowledge of the effectiveness of integrative treatments including CAM added to existing pain management strategies for veterans with mental health co-morbidities. Chiropractic is one CAM treatment that has demonstrated its evidence of efficacy and safety in the treatment of MSK disorders and the DoD/VA Pain Management Task Force comprehensive pain management program includes chiropractic as a Tier 1 treatment modality. However the appropriate role for chiropractic in veteran populations especially those with MSK pain and mental health disorders requires further investigation.","Address;Advisory Committees;Alternative Therapies;Analgesics;Anxiety;Back Pain;Caring;Clinical Practice Guideline;Clinical Trials;Comorbidity;Complementary and alternative medicine;Complementary therapies;Complex;Consensus;Department of Defense;Development;Doctor of Chiropractic;Effectiveness;Emotional;Evaluation;Future;Guidelines;Headache;Health;Health Services;Healthcare;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Literature;Medical Research;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Mental disorders;Methods;Military Personnel;Modality;Modeling;Musculoskeletal;Musculoskeletal Diseases;Musculoskeletal Pain;Neck Pain;Opioid;Outcome;Pain;Pain management;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Population;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Process;Productivity;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Randomized Controlled Trials;Reporting;Research Proposals;Risk;Role;Safety;Services;Spine pain;Staging;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Veterans;Work;aged;arm;base;chiropracty;chronic pain;collaborative care;disability;health administration;multidisciplinary;narcotic overdose;physical conditioning;programs;screening;standard care;therapy design;treatment program","Collaborative Care for Veterans with Spine Pain and Mental Health Conditions","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chiropractic care is a non-pharmacological complementary and alternative medicine therapy that has demonstrated its evidence of efficacy and safety in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently an unmet clinical need for diagnostic tests that rapidly provide direct evidence and localization of foreign-body infections (e.g. catheter and prosthetic-joint infections). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the second most common bacterial species responsible for foreign-body infections and it is responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality that result from such infections due to its highly virulent nature. This proposal is based on a novel molecular imaging approach that rapidly and specifically detects S. aureus infections with a fluorescent probe that is activated by an S. aureus-specific nuclease. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to translate this approach into clinical practice. The objective of this application is to carry out preclinical evaluation of an optimized S. aureus-specific activatable probe in a murine foreign-body S. aureus infection model. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that an optimized probe will exhibit low toxicity and high sensitivity and specificity for imaging S. aureus foreign-body infections in mice. The Specific Aims are: 1) Identify a Next Generation TT probe (NGTT probe) by incorporating a fluorophore/quencher combination that is optimal for in vivo imaging. The spectral characteristics and activated/unactivated fluorescence ratio of the first generation ""TT probe"" will be optimized with the design generation and comparison of several probe variants with red-shifted fluorophores and appropriately matched quenchers. These probes will be evaluated in vitro and in a pyomyositis S. aureus infection model. The best- performing probe will be selected as the NGTT probe. 2) Image S. aureus foreign-body biofilm infections in mice with the NGTT probe. Foreign-body biofilm infections are a large and problematic category of S. aureus infections. The utility of the NGTT probe will be tested in a mouse model of such infections in which S. aureus biofilms grow on catheters implanted in the mice. 3) Assess the safety of the NGTT probe in mice. Various measures of toxicity including complete blood counts will be taken in mice after intravenous administration of the NGTT probe. Doses of the probe 10-fold greater than those found to yield robust infection imaging will be administered. The proposed work is expected to result in the optimization and thorough pre-clinical testing of this approach for imaging S. aureus foreign-body biofilm infections. This contribution is significant because it will provide an essential foundation for the translation of a diagnostic imaging approach for S. aureus infections and thus constitutes critical progress towards addressing an unmet clinical need. The work proposed is novel in several respects. This will be the first thorough preclinical assessment of a nuclease-activated oligonucleotide probe for the non-invasive diagnostic imaging of any medical condition. This work also represents the first evaluation of efficacy and specificity of our imaging approach in a model of a common clinical problem an important step towards clinical translation. Finally the application of this approach to foreign-body biofilm infections constitutes an innovative solution to a challenging problem.","Address;Animal Model;Animals;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Biological Assay;Biopsy;Categories;Catheters;Characteristics;Clinical;Complete Blood Count;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic Imaging;Diagnostic tests;Dose;Evaluation;Exhibits;Fever;Fluorescence;Fluorescent Probes;Foreign Bodies;Foundations;Generations;Goals;Health;Image;Implant;In Vitro;Infection;Investigation;Joint Prosthesis;Laboratory culture;Life;Measures;Medical;Medical emergency;Microbial Biofilms;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Nature;Oligonucleotide Probes;Pain;Property;Qualifying;Research;Risk;Safety;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sepsis;Specificity;Staging;Staphylococcus aureus;Swelling;Symptoms;Technology;Testing;Tissues;Toxic effect;Translating;Translations;Variant;Virulent;Work;base;clinical practice;design;efficacy evaluation;expectation;experience;fluorophore;imaging probe;improved;in vivo imaging;innovation;intravenous administration;joint infection;molecular imaging;mortality;mouse model;next generation;non-invasive imaging;novel;novel diagnostics;nuclease;optic imaging;pre-clinical;preclinical evaluation;research clinical testing","Non-invasive imaging of Staphylococcus aureus foreign-body infections","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The work proposed here is focused on preclinical development of a non-invasive imaging approach for detecting and localizing foreign-body bacterial infections in animals.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite more than a decade of heightened attention and extensive efforts to improve patient safety recent studies find that patient harms remain common in American hospitals. Studies also report that Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) have higher risk-adjusted 30-day mortality rates compared with non-CAHs and the rates increased between 2002 and 2010. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is actively disseminating TeamSTEPPS an evidence-based teamwork and team training intervention for improving communication and teamwork skills among health care providers. Our previous research has found that many CAHs struggled with making timely progress with implementing and sustaining TeamSTEPPS. One of the biggest miss-steps was that they initiated the implementation without conducting necessary preparation steps. Once initiated the limited resource conditions constrained the CAHs' ability to adjust their implementation approach which often led to the suspension or dismissal of the implementation effort. The objective of this study is to develop a pre-training intervention specifically designed to assist CAHs to prepare forTeamSTEPPS. We will pilot test the intervention in four CAHs and prospectively examine how the intervention influences the process of implementing TeamSTEPPS in these CAHs.  We will address three specific aims. The first aim is to design a pre-training intervention to assist CAHs to prepare for TeamSTEPPS implementation. Building on our previous work that identified five key elements to strategic preparation  assessing strategic needs assessing the organizational context selecting change agents developing a shared understanding and specifying implementation goals we will develop an intervention protocol that specifies key steps and practical guidelines for conducting pre-training preparation. The second specific aim is to conduct the pre-training intervention in four CAHs and prospectively examine the implementation processes in these hospitals. We will recruit and conduct the intervention in four CAHs before they participate in the TeamSTEPPS Master Trainer Training. After the Training we will make quarterly visits to each hospital to collect data on implementation dynamics (implementation fidelity and focus change agent efficacy and engagement) and progress (timing and scope of implementation activities). The third specific aim is to evaluate the relationship between the elements of the intervention and the implementation dynamics and progress. We will use both traditional qualitative methods and the Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) to identify integral connections linking specific elements of the intervention to various process outcomes such as implementation fidelity change agent engagement and implementation progress. We expect that the proposed intervention after future refinement and testing can be used to facilitate TeamSTEPPS implementation in CAHs and will significant contribute to AHRQ's effort to disseminate this evidence-based program to enhance patient safety."," ","Pre-Training Intervention for Expedited TeamSTEPPS Implementation in Critical Access Hospitals","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: AHRQ is actively disseminating TeamSTEPPS an evidence-based teamwork and team training intervention for improving communication and teamwork skills among health care providers. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) however face significant challenges in implementing TeamSTEPPS because they uniformly have limited resources and infrastructure to support such a large complex initiative. The proposed study aims to develop and pilot test a pre-training intervention designed to assist CAHs to prepare for TeamSTEPPS which will facilitate future dissemination of this evidence-based program to enhance patient safety.","AHRQ","9096717","8/1/2016","PAR-10-168","5R03HS024112-02","5","R03","HS","024112","02","","BATTLES, JAMES ","7/1/2015","4/30/2018","Healthcare Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Research[HSQR]"," ","11005102","ZHU, XI ","Not Applicable","01","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","4/30/2018"," ","226","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","37761"," ","AHRQ","24761","13000"," ","37761",
"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Hypertension","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ubiquitin ligases regulate protein turnover by promoting ubiquitination of substrate proteins which targets them for proteosomal degradation. CRL or Cullin-Ring ubiquitin Ligases comprise the largest class of evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin ligases. One member of this family Cullin-3 (Cul3) plays an important role in arterial pressure regulation as mutations in the genes encoding Cul3 or Cul3 adaptor proteins cause dominant forms of hypertension. Our published evidence and preliminary data support a novel concept that vascular smooth muscle Cul3 plays a substantive role in arterial pressure regulation and its dysregulation causes hypertension. We hypothesize that Cul3 is a regulator of RhoA a small GTPase which controls Rho kinase activity calcium sensitivity nitric oxide responsiveness and contractile activity in vascular smooth muscle. Importantly the role of vascular Cul3 expression and action in arterial pressure regulation has yet to be investigated. We will test the innovative concept that blood pressure is regulated in part through a Cul3-dependent pathway in vascular smooth muscle. Specifically we hypothesize that a) impaired Cul3 activity causes hypertension b) Cul3 mutants causing human hypertension do not properly ubiquitinate Cul3 substrates (such as RhoA) and c) Cul3 mutants act dominantly by interfering with wild-type endogenous Cul3. The aims of the project are to: 1) test the hypothesis that dominant interference of wildtype Cul3 by mutant Cul3 in vascular smooth muscle and vascular smooth muscle-specific deficiency in Cul3 results in impaired vasomotor function and hypertension and 2) explore molecular mechanisms by which mutations in Cul3 which cause human hypertension result in impaired ubiquitination of Cul3 substrates. These studies are significant in advancing the concept that protein turnover is a regulator of vascular smooth muscle function and arterial pressure regulation in mechanistically defining how mutations in Cul3 cause human hypertension and in establishing mechanisms by which impaired Cul3 activity causes hypertension. The long term goal of this project is to assess if the Cul3 pathway can be used as a potential therapeutic target in hypertension.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Agonist;Amino Acids;Biochemistry;Blood Pressure;Blood Vessels;C57BL/6 Mouse;CRISPR/Cas technology;Calcium;Cardiovascular system;Cell Line;Cells;Cellular biology;Complex;Cullin Proteins;Data;Equilibrium;Exons;Family;Family member;Future;G-Protein-Coupled Receptors;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic study;Goals;Health;Human;Human Genetics;Hypertension;Kidney;Laboratories;Lead;Length;LoxP-flanked allele;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Mus;Muscle function;Mutation;Nitric Oxide;PPAR gamma;Pathway interactions;Phenocopy;Physiology;Play;Potassium;Proteins;Publishing;Rattus;Reagent;Regulation;Reporting;Research Personnel;Resistance;Rho-associated kinase;Role;Site;Small Interfering RNA;Smooth Muscle;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Sodium;Substrate Specificity;Testing;Ubiquitination;Variant;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Vasomotor;blood pressure regulation;cullin-3;dimer;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;knock-down;member;mouse model;mutant;novel;pressure;protein degradation;recombinase;response;therapeutic target;ubiquitin ligase","Hypertension: Role of Smooth Muscle Cullin-3 and the CRL3 Complex","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Cullin-3 (Cul3) is a member of the Cullin-Ring ubiquitin Ligase family of evolutionarily conserved ubiquitin ligases which regulate the turnover of target proteins.

"Bioengineering; Cancer; Diagnostic Radiology","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Positron emission tomography (PET) is an inherently quantitative medical imaging technique. When combined with radiopharmaceuticals that provide valuable information on the state of malignancies PET is a potentially powerful imaging modality for assessing response to new cancer therapies in multi-center clinical trials. Manufacturers of commercial PET scanner systems however understandably strive to generate higher quality diagnostic (i.e. detection task optimized) images to achieve market differentiation but not necessarily the most accurate quantitative data. Recent advances in image reconstruction algorithms enhance image quality but have paradoxically increased quantitative differences between PET scanners. The resulting variations in quantitative accuracy confound the comparisons of data within multi-center clinical trials. National and international efforts have been initiated to standardize protocols that impact PET quantitation. However there has been limited effort to harmonize image reconstruction methodologies and parameters to resolve the problem of the substantial variability in PET image accuracy in multi-center trials. This size- and scanner-dependent variability degrades the quality of clinical trials by requiring more patient accrual and/or leading to inconclusive results in tests of badly needed cancer therapies. The proposed project will solve this problem through a combination of rigorous NIST traceable calibration standards combined with the development of an industry-supported harmonized PET image reconstruction paradigm providing quantitatively accurate and reproducible measurements with known errors characteristics. The project is supported by all three major PET/CT scanner manufacturers facilitated through the Society of Nuclear Medicine's Clinical Trials Network and will be primarily performed by three leading PET/CT academic institutions with extensive experience in quantitative imaging and established track records of substantial collaboration with the three manufacturers. Data will also be collected from other PET centers as needed to provide representative data and harmonized reconstruction solutions for the full range of 17 different current vintage PET/CT scanners.","Algorithms;Calibration;Characteristics;Clinical Trials;Clinical Trials Network;Collaborations;Communities;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnostic;Discipline of Nuclear Medicine;Effectiveness;Generations;Hand;Image;Image Reconstructions;Imaging Techniques;Industry;Institution;International;Lesion;Malignant Neoplasms;Manufacturer Name;Marketing;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Medical Imaging;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial;Multicenter Trials;Noise;Outcome;Patients;Performance;Physicians;Positioning Attribute;Positron-Emission Tomography;Problem Solving;Professional Organizations;Protocols documentation;Radiopharmaceuticals;Records;Recovery;Residual state;Site;Societies;Specific qualifier value;System;Techniques;Testing;Time;To specify;Universities;Variant;Work;base;cancer clinical trial;cancer therapy;cost;design;detector;drug development;experience;imaging biomarker;imaging modality;interest;novel therapeutics;programs;quantitative imaging;reconstruction;response;trial design","Harmonized PET Reconstructions for Cancer Clinical Trials","There is considerable interest in the medical and cancer community to use the information provided by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging to help decrease the cost of drug development and the time it takes to bring these new drugs safely and effectively into the hands of physicians and patients.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Genetics; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The consequences of microvascular or small vessel disease (SVD) are particularly devastating for brain. Knowledge of mechanisms that underlie and might potentially be used to treat SVD are very limited. Growing interest in the pathogenesis of SVD supported by our preliminary data led us to focus on brain parenchymal arterioles major resistance vessels and a preferential target of the SVD process. This knowledge gap increases even further when aging a major risk factor for vascular disease is considered. Endothelial dysfunction is a critical determinant of vascular disease and predictor of clinical events. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) exerts protective effects in the vasculature. Our preliminary data suggest expressing a human dominant negative form of PPAR in endothelium has no effect in large arteries in adult mice at baseline but when combined with aging induces severe vascular dysfunction. In brain microvessels interference with endothelial PPAR is sufficient on its own to cause endothelial dysfunction. Our overall hypothesis is that endothelial PPAR (and PPAR targets) protect against oxidative stress and microvascular dysfunction normally and that loss of this protective network augments vascular dysfunction and cognitive deficits with aging. Aim 1 uses mice with cell-specific genetic manipulations along with physiological and pharmacological approaches to examine mechanisms by which interference with endothelial PPAR impairs microvascular function structure and mechanics. Pilot experiments suggest oxidative stress and activation of Rho kinase play a key role in these effects. Vascular disease and cognition are associated but the relationship is based mainly on the temporal relationship between these endpoints. Experiments to determine if vascular specific manipulations can promote or protect against cognitive deficits have been lacking. We will explore this concept directly by testing if genetic manipulation of endothelium in mice affects age-induced vascular dysfunction and cognitive deficits. In Aim 2 we will combine cell specific genetic approaches with aging to determine if interference with endothelial PPAR accelerates microvascular aging and cognitive deficits via oxidative stress-dependent mechanisms. Complementary experiments will examine if increased expression of wild-type PPAR in endothelium inhibits microvascular aging and the associated cognitive deficits. Pilot data support this hypothesis. Thus the overall goal of these studies is o define cell-specific molecular determinants of microvascular endothelial dysfunction. We focus on a unique and critically important segment of the vasculature where surprisingly little is known. The studies will fill gaps identified by the NIH regarding the need for understanding of SVD vascular geroscience and their impact on brain vascular function and cognitive deficits.      ","Adult;Affect;Age;Aging;Angiotensin II;Area;Arteries;Biology;Blood Vessels;Brain;Cardiovascular system;Carotid Arteries;Cells;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Clinical;Cognition;Cognitive deficits;Data;Dementia;Disease;Disease model;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Educational workshop;Elements;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Event;Functional disorder;Geroscience;Goals;Health;Human;Hypertension;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Knowledge;Link;Literature;Mechanics;Microvascular Dysfunction;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Oxidative Stress;PPAR gamma;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Play;Process;Resistance;Rho-associated kinase;Risk Factors;Role;Societies;Structure;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Vascular Diseases;age related;base;cerebral artery;clinical predictors;endothelial dysfunction;genetic approach;genetic manipulation;innovation;interest;mouse model;nervous system disorder;new therapeutic target;novel;parenchymal arterioles;prevent;protective effect;public health relevance;research study;stroke;transcription factor","Molecular Mechanisms of Microvascular Disease in Brain","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disease of small blood vessels in brain causes stroke and may be an important contributor to cognitive deficits that occur in many people with aging or hypertension.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inhalation exposures of metal-based particles have been associated with severe adverse health outcomes from metal fume fever to cancer. Compared to the larger particles present in samples collected with typical industrial hygiene samplers (e.g. respirable) nanoparticles have substantially greater biological reactivity deposition in the respiratory tract and mobility in the body after depositing. Thus freshly produced nanoparticles near fume sources may drive much of the observed adverse health effects and respirable sampling may be insufficient to assess metal-based exposure risks. We have recently developed a novel personal sampler-the nanoparticle respiratory dose (NRD) sampler-and an associated analytical method that is easy to use is inexpensive to analyze and integrates into current personal exposure sampling strategies that can streamline the multi-step process for assessing titanium dioxide nanoparticle exposures. The work outlined in this application will expand the applicability of the NRD sampler and associated analytical methods to dramatically improve exposure assessment of a broad range of metal-based nanoparticle exposures in the workplace. With successful completion of the work proposed here there will be many benefits including an innovative new sampler (Aim 1) coupled with associated analytical methods (Aim 2) applicable to assessing exposures to airborne metal-based particles. These new methodologies validated through field studies (Aim 3) will be available for exposure assessments in routine industrial hygiene practice and in epidemiological study to better elucidate the adverse health effects that may be associated specifically with certain metal-based nanoparticle exposures. Consequently our methods will have widespread use to assess exposures in the burgeoning field of nanotechnology or in more traditional occupational settings such as where welding occurs.

"Brain Cancer; Brain Disorders; Breast Cancer; Cancer; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although a number of anticancer drugs have been developed in the last 60 years there is a lack of effective drugs against many solid tumors such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) brain cancer and melanoma. Therefore there is an urgent need to develop novel anticancer agents against these solid tumors.  Superstolides A and B natural products isolated from marine sponge exhibit potent anticancer activity. Their unique chemical structure indicates they may likely have a novel cellular target. But their scarcity plus the overwhelming difficulty in developing a practical total synthesis has severely impeded research into a thorough understanding of their mechanism of action and has hampered the gain of further insight into their clinical potential. We have solved the supply problem by synthesizing a truncated superstolide A (named as ZJ-101) that retains the full anticancer activity of the natural product. The cell lines of some of the most common and highly metastatic TNBC CNS and melanoma are especially sensitive to ZJ-101 (GI50 < 10 nM). In particular ZJ-101 appears to be most effective against cell lines with p53 mutations which are known to cause drug resistance. Thus ZJ-101 represents a new promising anticancer agent with a novel and as yet undefined mode of action. Due to its promising anticancer activity ZJ-101 has recently been selected by NCI to undergo additional preclinical evaluation. The objectives of this proposal are to conduct preclinical evaluation to assess the anticancer therapeutic potential of ZJ-101 and investigate its underlying mechanism of action. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that ZJ-101 can serve as an excellent advanced lead compound that biologically mimics its parental natural product and a collaborative medicinal chemistry and chemical biology investigation of ZJ-101 will lead to the development of new effective anticancer agents and the discovery of novel anticancer drug target(s). The specific aims of the proposal are: 1) to synthesize a sufficient quantity of ZJ-101 for preclinical evaluation and biological investigation. We will prepare 500 mg of ZJ-101 using our efficient synthetic process. The material will be supplied to NCI for hollow fiber test and to the co-PI at Johns Hopkins for biological study. 2) to conduct biological investigations of ZJ-101 and determine its mechanism of action. We will investigate the biochemical/molecular basis responsible for the potent antiproliferative activity of ZJ- 101. A number of clickable photoaffinity-labeled or fluorescent-labeled ZJ-101 probes will be synthesized and used for the identification of its molecular target(s) and elucidation of its mechanism of action. Various biochemical and molecular biology methods will be employed for target validation.  Results from this study will be highly significantnot only in advancing the development of novel anticancer agents from superstolides by assisting NCI to evaluate the anticancer therapeutic potential of ZJ- 101 but also for gaining fundamental new knowledge in the discovery of new anticancer drug target(s).      ","Advanced Development;Antineoplastic Agents;Biochemical;Biological;Biology;Cancer Patient;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cells;Central Nervous System Melanoma;Chemical Structure;Chemicals;Clinical;Coupled;Databases;Development;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Ensure;Exhibits;Fiber;Gene Mutation;Goals;Graph;Investigation;Knowledge;Label;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of brain;Malignant neoplasm of central nervous system;Marines;Metastatic Melanoma;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Molecular Probes;Molecular Target;Mutate;Mutation;Names;Natural Products;Pattern Recognition;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Photoaffinity Labels;Play;Porifera;Process;Research;Resistance development;Role;Solid Neoplasm;Source;TP53 gene;Testing;Time;Tumor Suppressor Genes;Universities;Validation;Water;anti-cancer therapeutic;anticancer activity;base;cancer cell;candidate identification;cellular targeting;conventional therapy;design;drug candidate;flexibility;innovation;insight;leukemia treatment;melanoma;novel;novel anticancer drug;preclinical evaluation;programs;public health relevance;scale up;screening;superstolide A;triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma","Chemical biology of superstolides--a novel class of anticancer natural products","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have recently designed and successfully synthesized a truncated superstolide A (named as ZJ-101) that retains the full anticancer activity of the origina natural product superstolide A.

This training will be accomplished through a project that will utilize an already identified unique cohot of >1300 female military personnel with comprehensive trauma history and mental health diagnosis and treatment baseline data. The goal will be to identify epigenetic biomarkers of trauma and PTSD and MDD susceptibility. Unfortunately female military personnel are at high risk for sexual trauma during their service with up to 30% suffering from this experience. Among these women over 25% develop PTSD and more than 14% develop MDD. While genetic susceptibility plays a role in the development of these disorders epigenetic modifications induced by trauma exposure likely play a critical role in illness susceptibility. With the advent o next-generation genome-wide assessment approaches relatively low-cost high-throughput methods to study DNA methylation are now available. While these technologies have made enormous leaps forward and can now provide us with a torrent of data the methods for making sense of the data are still catching up. While disease-based genome-wide DNA methylation measurement can turn up hundreds of thousands of epigenetic marks in cases it takes great statistical and bioinformatic sophistication to determine which of them plays an etiologic role in illness. The applicant proposes to learn the critical techniques for handling genome- wide DNA methylation data. This will be accomplished in part through pursuit of a Master's degree in bioinformatics. He will also be trained in psychiatric epigenetics by his primary mentor who is an established expert in this new field. This project will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether DNA methylation (DNAm) levels within particular genes are correlated with a history of exposure to sexual assault in the military (SAIM) among women; 2) To determine whether DNAm levels within particular genes are correlated with the likelihood of developing PTSD and MDD given exposure to SAIM; and 3) To determine in this exploratory aim whether DNAm levels within particular genes are correlated with the likelihood of treatment response in PTSD and MDD given exposure to SAIM. This proposal will allow for the development of the applicant as an expert in bringing together bioinformatics and epigenetics in the study of PTSD and MDD. Results will provide new insights into biomarkers that could be of value in assessing people at risk for PTSD and MDD and potentially in identifying those for whom preventive interventions should be initiated. In addition this training will provide the applicant with a set of tools that will be widely applicable to the study of epigenetic marks acros complex psychiatric illnesses.","Alcohol consumption;Animal Model;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Candidate Disease Gene;Clinical;Complex;DNA Methylation;Data;Data Analyses;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Doctor of Medicine;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Epigenetic Process;Evaluation;Event;Exposure to;Female;Functional disorder;Funding;Future;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Genetic Research;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Health;Human Genetics;Individual;Investigation;Lead;Learning;Life;Location;Major Depressive Disorder;Master&apos;s Degree;Measurement;Mental Depression;Mental Health;Mental disorders;Mentors;Methods;Military Personnel;Modification;Monitor;Participant;Pharmacological Treatment;Play;Population;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Predisposition;Preventive Intervention;Psychotherapy;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Saliva;Sampling;Services;Social support;Survivors;Symptoms;Techniques;Technology;Training;Trauma;Variant;Woman;base;cohort;cost;environmental stressor;epigenetic marker;experience;gene environment interaction;genome wide association study;genome-wide;high risk;human data;innovation;insight;member;next generation;pre-clinical;psychogenetics;sexual assault;sexual trauma;stress related disorder;tool;traumatic event;treatment response","Epigenetic Investigation of Trauma in PTSD and Depression","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal aims at training an M.D. clinical researcher in the new areas of: 1) the epigenetics of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD); and 2) bioinformatics for genome- wide data analysis through a project that will utilize an already identified unique cohort of >1300 female military personnel with comprehensive trauma history and mental health diagnosis and treatment baseline data.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Substance Abuse; Underage Drinking; Underage Drinking - Prevention & Treatment (NIAAA Only)","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This the second and final submission of a project designed to identify the neurobiological causes and consequences of binge drinking in college students using brain imaging and behavioral measures of disinibition and reward processing. Binge drinking or drinking large amounts of alcohol on a single occasion is increasing in college students and a growing subset of students engage in ""extreme bingeing"" drinking two or three times more on one occasion than the standard definition of bingeing. This is troubling because the prefrontal cortex (PFC) continues to develop into the early 20's and the adolescent brain is particularly sensitive to the effects of alcohol use.  Aspects of behavioral disinhibition and reward processing deficits are known to be associated with a general vulnerability toward a spectrum of psychopathological and substance use disorders including alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Advances in two areas of research provide the rationale for this project. One is an increase in imaging studies of AUDs indicating that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations offer more sensitive assays of disinhibition and reward processing deficits than other measures. The 2nd is growing neuroimaging literature indicating that top-down control systems in prefrontal cortex (PFC) mature linearly from early adolescence into the early twenties whereas ventral striatal areas of the reward system mature in mid-adolescence. Asymmetric maturation of top-down PFC networks vs the subcortical reward system suggests that an early age of first drink (AFD) and continued early bingeing would result in abnormalities in both reward processing- and response inhibition- networks when assessed in the 1st year of college. In contrast initiation of binge drinking at college entry would predominantly impact the response inhibition network since the reward system is mature. Bingeing throughout the next two years would further impair both brain networks in subjects with an early AFD and may begin to impair reward networks in college-entry initiates of bingeing.  This project will assess the relationship of typical and extreme bingeing to measures of brain function and structure as well as to measures of risky decision making and to aspects of personality mental abilities related to AUDS in college students. We will use fMRI during two tasks that activate brain systems that have been shown to be involved in problematic alcohol use. One task requires behavioral inhibition (Go/NoGo task) that is mediated by the dorsolateral PFC. The other task permits subject's to earn money during the fMRI scan and activates ventral brain reward systems and ventromedial PFC. A battery of laboratory and self-report measures of personality and mental abilities will also be given and the inter-relationships of the brain imagin and behavioral measures will be assessed. The imaging and behavioral battery will be administered again after 2 years to assess relationships of continuing bingeing to reward and response inhibition processes. The long-term goal of the project is improved efficacy of behavioral interventions into bingeing by using information concerning abnormalities identified by brain imaging.","Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent and Young Adult;Adult;Age;Alcohol abuse;Alcohol consumption;Alcohols;Area;Attenuated;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavioral;Behavioral inhibition;Biological Assay;Brain;Brain Injuries;Brain imaging;Characteristics;Corpus striatum structure;Country;Decision Making;Diagnostic;Disinhibition;Dopamine;Down-Regulation;Frequencies;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Future;Goals;Health;Health system;Image;Impairment;Incentives;Individual;Injury;Intervention;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Literature;MRI Scans;Measures;Mediating;Motor;Neurobiology;Patient Self-Report;Pattern;Personality;Personality Traits;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Psyche structure;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Research;Rewards;Risk;Risk Factors;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Structure;Students;Substance Use Disorder;System;Time;Unsafe Sex;adolescent binge drinking;alcohol effect;alcohol expectancy;alcohol research;alcohol use disorder;behavior measurement;binge drinker;binge drinking;brain behavior;cognitive function;cognitive process;college;college drinking;cost;design;drinking;early adolescence;early drinking;emotional stimulus;executive function;experience;improved;indexing;neuroimaging;response;reward processing;university student","The Relationship of Adolescent Binge Drinking to Measures of Brain and Behavior","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Binge drinking is an increasing problem in adolescents and young adults across the country costing millions to the public health system and potentially damaging the brain and intellectual functions.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neuron is remarkable in that upon the influx of Ca2+ it synchronizes vesicle fusion and releases many quanta of neurotransmitters to the synaptic cleft in less than 1 msec. The fast synchronization is orchestrated by interactions between the core fusion machinery SNAREs and auxiliary proteins including a major Ca2+-sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and a clamping factor complexin (Cpx). Because release underlies cognition and behavior toxic agents that undermine the release of neurotransmitter might lead to the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. In this project we use innovative approaches to investigate the mechanism whereby the fusion machinery achieves the synchronization of vesicle fusion. To mimic the native membrane environment we prepare a nanodisc sandwich that harbors a single trans SNARE complex in the middle. Single molecule (sm)FRET and site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) EPR are used to characterize the interactions of SNAREs with auxiliary proteins in the chasm of two nanodiscs. In addition the drastically improved single vesicle-vesicle fusion assay that can resolve docking lipid mixing fusion pore opening and pore expansion steps is used to delineate the intervention of regulatory factors onto individual fusion steps. Taken altogether a comprehensive picture of how synchronization of vesicle fusion is choreographed by the interactions among individual components of the fusion machinery would emerge. For neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's there is an emerging theme of pathophysiology that toxic misfolded oligomers are tampering with the vesicle fusion machinery leading to disease symptoms. We use EPR to investigate the interaction between -synuclein and vesicle (v-)SNARE VAMP2 that takes place on the membrane surface. The outcomes of these investigations are expected to reveal new therapeutic targets for treating symptoms of the Parkinson's disease.      ","Action Potentials;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Behavior;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Brain;C-terminal;Cognition;Cognitive;Communication;Complex;Dimensions;Disease;Disease Pathway;Docking;Environment;Exocytosis;Functional disorder;Goals;In Vitro;Individual;Intervention;Investigation;Lead;Lipids;Measurement;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Fusion;Memory;Mental disorders;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;N-terminal;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Outcome;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Peptides;Physiological;Poisons;Probability;Proteins;Regulation;SNAP receptor;Scanning;Site;Spin Labels;Structure;Surface;Symptoms;Synapses;Synaptic Cleft;Synaptic Vesicles;Testing;Vesicle;alpha synuclein;base;chemical release;controlled release;improved;innovation;insight;interest;millisecond;nanodisk;neurotransmitter release;new therapeutic target;presynaptic;protein misfolding;public health relevance;quantum;receptor;reconstitution;sensor;single-molecule FRET;symptom treatment;synaptotagmin I;target SNARE proteins;vesicular SNARE proteins","Regulation of SNARE-dependent synaptic vesicle fusion","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurons release chemical messengers called neurotransmitters to synapses via the pathway called vesicle fusion when stimulated by the action potential.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Krystal Parker is a postdoctoral research scholar in the Department of Neurology at the University of Iowa. She has an outstanding systems neuroscience background with a PhD in cerebellar circuitry and clinical training in cerebellar involvement in neuropsychiatric illness. Her primary research interests involve investigating mechanisms to harness the cerebellum to treat cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric illness. Career Development: This award will 1) ensure Dr. Parker finalizes training in advanced systems neuroscience techniques such as multisite neuronal recordings paired with optogenetics and 2) is poised to make a smooth transition to an independent scientist focused on developing new treatments for patients suffering cognitive abnormalities stemming from neurological and psychiatric disease. This proposal will optimally position Dr. Parker for an independent career translating insights on the functional role of basic cerebellar circuitry into therapies that could help patients with cognitive dysfunction. Research Strategy: There are currently no effective treatments for cognitive dysfunction in neuropsychiatric illness as the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Dr. Parker and the Narayanan laboratory study cognitive deficits using an interval timing task. This task is ideally suited to study the basic circuitry of cognition in schizophrenia as patients have reliable deficits task performance depends on known prefrontal circuitry and it can be investigated in animals displaying schizophrenia-like phenotypes. The cerebellum is essential for cognition and Dr. Parker's preliminary data show that it is also required for interval timing. In addition the cerebellum andprefrontal cortex are both consistently dysfunctional in schizophrenia patients suffering from cognitive dysfunction. Dr. Parker's preliminary data recapitulates timing deficits with disruption f both brain areas in animal models. Her overall goal is to develop an independent laboratory that focuses on leveraging the cerebellar connections to the frontal cortex to develop novel therapies in schizophrenia. The proposed experiments combine cutting-edge techniques to test the hypothesis that the cerebellum modulates dysfunctional prefrontal circuits impaired in schizophrenia. We expect that insights from this research will guide future therapies for patients suffering from impaired cognition. Mentors and Consultants: For this proposal Dr. Parker has identified a strong mentoring team. Her primary mentors will be Dr. Narayanan an innovative systems neuroscientist and neurologist who will teach her techniques for optogenetics neuronal ensemble recordings and data analysis. In parallel she will work with senior established mentor Dr. William Talman who will intensively mentor her in many of the career development aspects during her postdoctoral fellowship period but also in immunohistochemistry using confocal microscopy. Dr. John Freeman will informally consult with Dr. Parker in aspects of cerebellar dependent behavior cerebellar neuronal recordings and cerebellar histology. Dr. Parker recognizes her need for mentors in schizophrenia and has joined forces with Drs. Bita Moghaddam and Mikhail Pletnikov experts in experimental protocols in animals that are potentially relevant to schizophrenia. She will visit their laboratories to learn their methods beimmersed in their research programs and discuss her results and experimental designs with them and their lab members.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic nematodes including Brugia malayi which are transmitted through the bite of infected vector mosquitoes. The prevalence of LF is staggering; over 120 million people are infected with over 1.2 billion at risk in 73 endemic countries. Despite coordinated elimination efforts LF remains a significant global health concern and there is a recognized need for new strategies to control parasitic nematodes. Progress towards that goal is frustrated however because we simply do not have adequate understanding of parasite biology. For example the interaction between mosquito and parasite during the B. malayi life cycle is delicately balanced and although the parasite manipulates the mosquito to create conditions favorable to parasitism we know little about how they do this. Host-parasite interactions have long been promoted as novel intervention sites because any mechanism that disrupts the vector-parasite interaction and skews the balance in favor of the vector is likely to prevent infection parasite development or transmission. This project represents an exciting new direction for investigating the vector-parasite interface. We propose that B. malayi can actively manipulate the mosquito host to the benefit of the parasite by using small regulatory RNAs (microRNAs miRNA) delivered via specialized packages called exosomes. In Specific Aim 1 of this application we will characterize exosome secretion by Brugia within the mosquito host and identify exosome cargo. Exosomes will be collected from mosquito-borne stage parasites and visualized quantified and sized using electron microscopy and NanoSight tracking analysis. We will use deep sequencing techniques to characterize the small RNA cargo of the exosomes. Finally we will use biomarkers and bioinformatics to reveal profile exosome secretion throughout complete parasite development in the mosquito vector. In Specific Aim 2 we will explore the function of these exosomes at the vector-parasite interface. We will inject mosquitoes with purified exosomes and discrete small RNA cargo then monitor changes to normal vector biology using deep sequencing techniques. This will identify both novel and explicit parasite effector molecules and the vector pathways that are manipulated. Successful completion of this project will generate new knowledge of B. malayi biology fundamental to parasitism. Furthermore the mechanisms exposed may apply to other parasitic nematodes as they manipulate their hosts be they vectors humans livestock or indeed plants.      ","Aedes;Agriculture;Area;Bioinformatics;Biological Markers;Biology;Bite;Brugia;Brugia malayi;Cells;Characteristics;Country;Culicidae;Data;Development;Disease;Effector Cell;Electron Microscopy;Ensure;Equilibrium;Filarial Elephantiases;Future;Genes;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;Human;Infection prevention;Intervention;Knowledge;Life;Life Cycle Stages;Livestock;Medical;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Monitor;Nematoda;Parasite Control;Parasites;Parasitic nematode;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Plants;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Process;RNA;Research;Risk;Role;Site;Small RNA;Staging;System;Techniques;Therapeutic Intervention;Translating;Transmission Electron Microscopy;deep sequencing;exosome;global health;nanoparticle;neglected tropical diseases;novel;parasitism;pathogen;programs;public health relevance;transcriptome sequencing;transcriptomics;transmission process;vector;vector mosquito","Characterization of parasitic nematode exosomal microRNAs and their role in the host-parasite interface","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will significantly advance our understanding of how parasitic nematodes manipulate their host to ensure transmission to humans.

"Asthma; Clinical Research; Health Services; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a devastating condition that incurs long-term medical and financial burdens for affected children and their families. But identifying young children at high risk to develop asthma has proven difficult. Current predictive models are simplistic and do not recognize the underlying complexity of asthma; however more complex models tend to lose clinical utility. Yet such models are needed: asthma is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases affecting seven million children in the United States alone. Recent studies suggest that clustering early childhood respiratory and allergy symptoms (i.e. wheezing respiratory infections atopic dermatitis) into distinct phenotypes may improve the ability to predict asthma development in children. However little is known about the biologic risks underlying these phenotypes. Metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction for instance has been associated with asthma but critical gaps remain in our understanding of how it leads to development of the disease. Newborn metabolic screening is a public health initiative aimed at screening every child born for endocrine disorders and rare inborn errors of metabolism including many disorders indicative of metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction. This screening represents a unique data source that can be analyzed alongside perinatal and environmental exposures to further our understanding of asthma etiology. We hypothesize that individuals with mild metabolic disturbances at birth will be more prone to further metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to the development of respiratory and allergy phenotypes later in childhood when exposed to triggers in the environment or to other stressors. Using two prospective cohort studies from Tennessee designed to identify risk factors for asthma; we will address this hypothesis through the following specific study goal and aims. Specific Study Goal: Determine if inclusion of newborn metabolic screening data improves prediction of early childhood respiratory and allergy phenotypes. Aim 1: Identify clusters of respiratory phenotypes based on early childhood respiratory and allergy symptoms. Aim 2: Identify clinical demographic environmental and newborn metabolic screening metabolites that are predictive of infant respiratory morbidity and asthma and allergy phenotypic groups. Aim 3: Validate predictive models and determine the sensitivity and specificity of our model. Combining clinical and environmental data with data such as neonatal screening measurements routinely captured by state programs is a novel approach for creating predictive models that can be incorporated into clinically available tools account for heterogeneity in asthma phenotypes and uncover novel disease pathways. If this approach is successful our predictive models will improve the diagnosis of asthma in childhood and possibly lead to prevention or strategies for early intervention of a significant illness that affects millions of children worldwide.      ","6 year old;Accounting;Address;Affect;Age of Onset;Alanine;Allergic;Allergic rhinitis;Animal Model;Arginine;Asthma;Atopic Dermatitis;Biochemical Pathway;Biological;Biological Factors;Biological Process;Birth;Carnitine;Cessation of life;Child;Childhood;Childhood Asthma;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Clinical;Cohort Studies;Complex;Data;Data Sources;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Pathway;Early Intervention;Endocrine System Diseases;Enrollment;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Risk Factor;Etiology;Exploratory/Developmental Grant;Exposure to;Family;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Goals;Heterogeneity;Hospitalization;Hypersensitivity;IgE;Inborn Errors of Metabolism;Individual;Infant;Infection;Intervention;Lead;Life;Longitudinal Studies;Lower Respiratory Tract Infection;Lung;Lung Inflammation;Measurement;Measures;Medical;Metabolic;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Nature;Neonatal Screening;Newborn Infant;Oxidative Stress;Perinatal Exposure;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Predisposition;Prevention;Public Health;Research;Respiratory Signs and Symptoms;Respiratory Tract Infections;Respiratory physiology;Respiratory syncytial virus;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sensitivity and Specificity;Severities;Supplementation;Symptoms;Tennessee;Testing;United States;Wheezing;asthma prevention;base;cohort;cost;design;early childhood;high risk;improved;mitochondrial dysfunction;novel;novel strategies;oxidation;population based;predictive modeling;prevent;programs;prospective;public health relevance;respiratory;respiratory health;screening;stressor;tool","Newborn Metabolic Screening for Prediction of Childhood Respiratory Phenotypes","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and results in significant illness and death worldwide.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Lung; Pneumonia; Pneumonia & Influenza; Substance Abuse","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic alcoholism increases the incidence and severity of respiratory diseases and infections. Indeed alcoholics compared to non-alcoholic individuals have increased mortality and morbidity during bacterial pneumonias. While much is known about the role that chronic alcohol plays in increasing the severity of respiratory bacterialinfections much less is understood about how chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption alters the severity of pulmonary virus infections. Interestingly our studies indicate that chronic consumption of EtOH increases both influenza virus associated morbidity and mortality. Further our results demonstrate that this increased severity of disease is related to defects or alteration in influenza-specific CD8 T cell responses as well as respiratory dendritic cells (rDC). Importantly our findings of severe disease and poor outcomes using the Meadows-Cook model of EtOH consumption have been supported by a recent study in humans which showed that heavy alcohol use is a risk factor for severe outcomes during influenza virus infections. Therefore given the current threat of both epidemic and potential pandemic influenza a better understanding of the lesions within the pulmonary adaptive immune response in chronic alcoholics could lead to methodologies to boost immunity to this important human pathogen in these individuals. Our long- range goal is to determine what lesions chronic EtOH induces within the respiratory adaptive immune response. Within this application we will continue to use the Meadow-Cook chronic EtOH model as well as our mouse models of influenza virus infection to determine the contributions of the EtOH induced environment vs. T cell intrinsic lesions in the reduced CD8 T cell immunity during primary influenza virus infections of the chronic EtOH lung. Further as the CD8 T cell response in non immunologically naive individuals is made up of both new nave T cell responses as well as existing T cell memory this application will be the first t determine how chronic EtOH alters CD8 T cell memory that has been established prior to chronic EtOH consumption. Our central hypothesis is that the chronic EtOH induced lesion in the primary CD8 T cell response is made up of both environmental and T cell intrinsic defects and that chronic EtOH will reduce existing CD8 T cell memory. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the contribution of ""environmental"" vs. T cell intrinsic factors to theEtOH induced lesion in the primary IAV-specific CD8 T cell response 2) Determine how chronic ethanol consumption alters existing influenza-specific CD8 T cell memory and heterosubtypic protection against influenza virus infections. This application will not only define the defects tht chronic EtOH creates in pulmonary adaptive immunity during respiratory virus infections but should also increase our understanding of immunity during other (bacterial/fungal) respiratory infections.      ","Alcohol abuse;Alcoholism;Alcohols;Bacterial Infections;Bacterial Pneumonia;CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cellular Immunity;Chronic;Consumption;Cytolysis;Defect;Dendritic Cells;Disease;Environment;Epidemic;Ethanol;Goals;Health;Heavy Drinking;Human;Immune response;Immunity;Immunosuppressive Agents;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Influenza;Influenza A Virus H5N1 Subtype;Influenza A virus;Ingestion;Intestinal Mucosa;Intravenous;Intrinsic factor;Iowa;Knowledge;Lead;Lesion;Liver;Lung;Lung diseases;Mediating;Methodology;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mycoses;Natural immunosuppression;Nature;Outcome;Patients;Play;Pneumonia;Predisposition;Research Personnel;Respiratory Mucosa;Respiratory Tract Infections;Risk Factors;Role;Severities;Severity of illness;Skin;Spleen;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Universities;Virus Diseases;adaptive immunity;base;chronic alcohol ingestion;cooking;expectation;influenzavirus;intraperitoneal;mortality;mouse model;non-alcoholic;novel strategies;pandemic influenza;pathogen;problem drinker;public health relevance;respiratory;respiratory infection virus;subcutaneous","Chronic Alcohol Alteration of Influenza-Specific CD8 T cell Immunity and Protection","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While many studies have detailed the increase in disease severity during respiratory infections in alcoholics much less is understood about the underlying mechanisms through which chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption mediates this increase in disease severity or how alcohol alters pulmonary adaptive immune responses.

"Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Digestive Diseases; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5-year training program for the development of an academic career in Pediatric Rheumatology. The PI has completed formal residency and fellowship training in Pediatrics and Pediatric Rheumatology at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and is currently expanding his scientific skills in immune tolerance and autoimmunity models. Dr. Gary Koretzky an international authority in lymphocyte biology will mentor the PI's scientific development. Dr. Koretzky is Vice Chair for Research Chief Scientific Officer and Francis C. Wood Professor of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He has extensive experience in successfully mentoring students post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty members. To further promote the investigator's scientific development an Advisory Committee comprising highly regarded medical scientists including Drs. Steven Reiner Terri Finkel and Edward Behrens has been established. Sjgren syndrome experts Drs. Seunghee Cha and Eduardo M. Rocha will participate in advisory roles as well. Drs. Finkel and Behrens are also leaders in Pediatric Rheumatology and will mentor the PI's clinical development.  The proposed research focuses on mechanisms of immune dysregulation in the development of Sjgren syndrome a common but poorly understood autoimmune disease. Sjgren syndrome is caused by destruction and dysfunction of lacrimal and salivary glands with subsequent profound ocular and oral dryness which may progress to sight-threatening or severe dental manifestations. The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse spontaneously develops autoimmunity resembling Sjgren  syndrome providing a tool for studying disease initiation. Inflammatory cell infiltrates of lacrimal and salivary glands are dominated by T cells but the contributions of different T cell subsets in disease initiation are unknown. Regulatory T cells a subset of CD4+ T cells which prevent autoimmunity in normal hosts are organized anatomically in non-autoimmune-prone mice; however whether this is disrupted in autoimmune-prone mice is unknown. Female NOD mice develop salivary gland inflammation whereas males develop lacrimal gland disease. Whether this is due to immune- cell intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms is unknown. This proposal specifically aims to: 1) define the roles of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in disease initiation; 2) define the extent and mechanisms of regulatory T cell defects in the NOD model of Sjgren syndrome. Understanding the earliest events in the development of Sjgren syndrome autoimmunity will provide targets for better diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for use in this and other autoimmune diseases.","Address;Adoptive Transfer;Advisory Committees;Affect;American;Autoantibodies;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmune Process;Autoimmunity;Back;Bioluminescence;Bone Marrow;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Cells;Cervical lymph node group;Childhood;Chimera organism;Clinical;Data;Defect;Dental;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Dryness;Early identification;Etiology;Event;Exocrine Glands;Faculty;Fellowship;Female;Functional disorder;Future;Gland;Goals;Homeostasis;Human;Image;Immune;Immune Tolerance;Immune system;In Vitro;Inbred NOD Mice;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Infiltrate;International;Lacrimal gland structure;Lymphocyte;Lymphocyte Biology;Lymphocytic Infiltrate;Mediating;Medical;Medicine;Mentors;Modality;Modeling;Mus;Non obese;Oral;Organ;Pathogenesis;Pediatric Hospitals;Pediatrics;Pennsylvania;Philadelphia;Population;Postdoctoral Fellow;Production;Program Development;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Reporter;Research;Research Personnel;Residencies;Rheumatism;Rheumatology;Role;Saliva;Salivary Gland Diseases;Salivary Glands;Scientist;Sialadenitis;Site;Sjogren&apos;s Syndrome;Symptoms;Syndrome;T-Cell Development;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;Therapeutic;Time;Training;Training Programs;Universities;Vision;Wood material;Xerostomia;authority;autoimmune exocrinopathy;autoimmune rheumatologic disease;base;career;congenic;cytokine;diabetic;experience;eye dryness;in vivo;insight;lymph nodes;male;member;mouse model;prevent;professor;research study;sex;sexual dimorphism;skills;student mentoring;tool","Immunopathogenesis of Sjogren syndrome","Sjgren syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by destruction of tear and saliva producing glands resulting in profound dry eye and dry mouth which may result in sight-threatening or severe dental complications.

"Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this application we propose to investigate treatment using animal models of the genetically heterogeneous blinding disorder Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS). At least seventeen BBS genes have been reported to date. BBS is a pleiotropic disorder with the primary  clinical  features  of pigmentary  retinopathy  obesity  polydactyly  learning disabilities  renal  abnormalities  and  hypogenitalism.  BBS patients alsohave an increased incidence of hypertension diabetes mellitus and congenital heart defects. The retinal degeneration of BBS is early onset and typically leads to blindness in the second decade of life. The blindness component of the BBS phenotype is the most concerning aspect of the disorder to patients and their families and hence the component of BBS that we will focus on for treatment. Strategies for treating inherited forms of blindness include gene therapy stem cell therapy and pharmacological treatments. Gene therapy can theoretically target the primary gene defective in the specific patient or alternatively target genes that modify the primary gene.Access to a number of different BBS animal models provides us with the opportunity to examine a variety of different approaches to treat the blindness component of BBS. In the proposed studies we will utilize zebrafish to identify the specific genetic types of BBS that are most likey to be readily treatable with gene replacement therapy and based on the zebrafish data we will select at least six BBS mouse models to be treated with gene therapy (specific aim 1). In specific aim 2 we will pursue the hypothesis that some forms of BBS can be treated by alteration of the expression of modifier genes. Finally in specific aim 3 we hypothesize that specific molecular pathways modify BBS phenotypes. We will test this hypothesis by using pharmaceuticals to treat BBS mouse models targeting specific cellular pathways including apoptosis; endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response; chaperones; and PDGFR signaling. Our studies will lead to a better understanding of cilia-related retinopathies; assist in classifying which of a number of treatments will best work and provide an initial step in going from treatment of animal models to human treatment.","Animal Model;Apoptosis;Bardet-Biedl Syndrome;Blindness;Cilia;Clinical;Cognitive;Complex;Congenital Heart Defects;Data;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Effectiveness;Eye;Family;Family member;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Gene Proteins;Gene Targeting;Gene-Modified;Genes;Genetic;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;Hypertension;Incidence;Individual;Inherited;Kidney;Knockout Mice;Knowledge;Lead;Learning Disabilities;Life;Medical Genetics;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Chaperones;Mutation;Obesity;Organ;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacological Treatment;Phenotype;Photoreceptors;Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha Receptor;Polydactyly;Proteins;Reporting;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Diseases;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Signal Transduction;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Validation;Work;Zebrafish;base;ciliopathy;clinically relevant;congenital anomaly;early onset;endoplasmic reticulum stress;gene function;gene interaction;gene replacement therapy;gene therapy;insight;mouse model;mutant;novel;prophylactic;protein complex;research study;response;stem cell therapy;treatment strategy","Treatment of a Complex Retinal Degenerative Syndrome","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The successful completion of this project will lead to insights into disease mechanisms causing inherited forms of blindness as well as insights into common major human disorders including obesity hypertension and diabetes.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION: Aptamers are nucleic acids with many of the properties of antibodies but with the advantage that they are selected and synthesized in vitro and have low to no immunogenicity. With high specificity for their targets and being large enough to cover a portion of a protein surface in order to compete with its binding partner aptamers are excellent candidate drugs for interfering with the viral-cell interactions. As more GP/surface receptor pairsare identified the possibility increases of developing drugs to interfere with viral cell entry. Adrug that can prevent viral glycoprotein (GP) interaction with its surface receptor can effectivelystop infection by enveloped viruses. A limitation in finding aptamers that effectively compete with viral-cell interactions is that the appropriate target sites on the viral GP are protected by  cloud of carbohydrate that the aptamer needs to penetrate. Many sites on the purified GP protein are also not accessible when the protein is integrated in the virion. Thus a simple selection against the purified GP is unlikely to identify the appropriate aptamer and selection against the virion is also unlikely to be sufficient due to the presence of other competing targetsthat are not involved in virus-cell interaction. This is a general challenge for isolating aptamersto many proteins located on the cell surfaces and integrated in viral particles.  Here we propose the application of new technologies including deep sequencing virion binding analysis on the sequencing microarrays and informatics to the challenge of isolating aptamers with better targeting for relevant cell surface or virion membrane associated proteins. This approach will provide an exciting new opportunity to obtain aptamers that target and block the ability of a GP to interact with its receptor. If successful this work will provide an aptamer that can be developed as a stopgap measure to minimize deaths from the deadly Ebolavirus outbreaks that are becoming increasingly frequent. The aptamer will also be useful for rapid diagnosis of Ebolavirus infection that first presents as a hemorrhagic fever similar to that associated with other viral diseases.","Acute;Address;Affinity;Africa;Antibodies;Binding;Bioinformatics;Biological;Carbohydrates;Categories;Cell Communication;Cell Line;Cell surface;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cessation of life;Disease Outbreaks;Ebola virus;Epitopes;Evolution;Family;Filovirus;Frankfurt-Marburg Syndrome Virus;GTPBP1 gene;Glycoproteins;Health;Human;In Situ;In Vitro;Infection;Informatics;Lysosomes;Measures;Membrane Glycoproteins;Membrane Proteins;Morbidity - disease rate;Nucleic Acids;Oligonucleotides;Outcome;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Plasma Proteins;Population;Property;Proteins;Sampling;Single-Stranded DNA;Site;Specificity;Structure;Surface;Testing;Viral;Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers;Viral Load result;Viral load measurement;Virion;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus-Cell Membrane Interaction;Western Africa;Work;aptamer;deep sequencing;disorder prevention;drug candidate;immunogenicity;mortality;new technology;next generation sequencing;novel strategies;particle;prevent;protein structure;rapid diagnosis;receptor;receptor binding;screening;uptake","Isolating aptamers to viral surface epitopes","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aptamers are excellent candidates for drugs that interfere with the entry of viruses into cells.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Invasive Aspergillosis caused by azole resistant A. fumigatus has an alarming 12% survivability making this a clinical problem of acute significance. Early work on azole resistant isolates of A. fumigatus suggested that azole resistance was a relatively rare occurrence and that the genetic basis of resistance was most often due to changes in a gene (cyp51A) encoding the azole target protein lanosterol -14 demethylase. Extensive studies from a group in the Netherlands provided compelling evidence that in that country most azole resistant A. fumigatus isolates contained a single compound mutation consisting of a duplicated region of the cyp51A promoter region (TR34) and a change in the coding sequence altering the amino acid sequence of the protein (L98H). However more recent studies from a group in the United Kingdom indicated that alterations in the cyp51A gene were unlikely to explain all azole resistance in A. fumigatus. More than 50% of azole resistant isolatesfrom UK patients have wild-type versions of cyp51A inconsistent with changes at this gene explaining drug tolerance. In 2013 the UK group identified an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-encoding gene called cdr1B as being associated with azole resistance in several patient isolates. Expression of cdr1B was elevated in highly azole tolerant clinical isolates whilethe cyp51A remained wild-type in sequence. Overexpression of ABC transporter-encoding genes resulting in azole tolerance has been the predominant route of azole resistance in the Candida species and we believe this will emerge as a key feature of drug resistance in A. fumigatus. This application will focus on the contributions of the cdr1B gene as expression of this ABC transporter is elevated in azole resistance isolates and loss of cdr1B produces an azole sensitive phenotype. We will directly compare the azole resistance phenotypes of wild-type and cdr1B cells containing various cyp51A mutations that are associated with clinically relevant drug resistance. We will also evaluate expression of cyp51A using immunological probes to determine if these mutant alleles influence protein levels; information that is currentlyunavailable in A. fumigatus. We will carry out a forward genetic screen using impala transposon mutagenesis to identify genes that modulate cdr1B expression. Together these approaches will provide important new information into the molecular basis of azole resistance in A. fumigatus and provide the direct assessment of drug resistance contributions from ABC transporters and the cyp51A gene.","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters;Acute;Alleles;Allergic;Amino Acid Sequence;Antifungal Agents;Appearance;Aspergillosis;Aspergillus fumigatus;Azole resistance;Azoles;Candida;Cell membrane;Cells;Chemistry;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Code;Country;Data;Development;Disease;Drug Efflux;Drug Tolerance;Drug effect disorder;Drug resistance;Elements;Europe;Gene Duplication;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Screening;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Healthcare Systems;Human;Hypersensitivity;In Vitro;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Laboratories;Lanosterol;Lesion;Link;Malaria;Molecular;Mutagenesis;Mutation;Mycoses;Natural regeneration;Netherlands;Oral;Organism;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Play;Population;Populations at Risk;Promoter Regions;Proteins;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Role;Route;Site;Survival Rate;System;Testing;Time;Trans-Activators;Tuberculosis;United Kingdom;United States;Work;antimicrobial drug;base;clinically relevant;cost;effective therapy;genetic analysis;interest;intravenous administration;mortality;mutant;overexpression;pathogen;promoter;research study;resistance mechanism","A new pathway for azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aspergillus fumigatus is the major human filamentous fungal pathogen a situation complicated by the relative resistance of this organism to common antifungal drugs.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Mental Health; Pediatric; Prevention; Smoking and Health; Substance Abuse; Tobacco","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the most common preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In efforts to block the initiation of adolescent smoking a variety of public health measures have been implemented. Despite the success of these measures a substantial minority of all adolescents still begin the initial 1- 3 year period f experimentation that can lead to regular daily smoking. Effective interventions to block the escalation of this initial smoking exist. However the implementation and effectiveness of these interventions is hindered by 1) an inability of pediatricians and allied health professionals to detect the presence of the periodic use of cigarettes that characterizes this phase and 2) an inexact understanding of smoking initiation to co-morbid features such as risky sex and alcohol use. This failure deprives a substantial number of adolescents of an opportunity to stop the escalation of smoking and smoking related behaviors during a critical phase of development and education.  Recently we have shown that DNA methylation at AHRR may be a sensitive indicator of early onset adolescent smoking. However our studies are incomplete in that we have not fully characterized the smoking dose response curve the effect of other environmental influences such as second hand smoke on DNA methylation and the relationship of DNA methylation to existing indicators of smoking status. In this R01 application we propose to improve our ability to detect and comprehend the trajectory of smoking behaviors by serially examining a large longitudinal cohort of 450 adolescents at risk for smoking and their families over a two year period. We will determine DNA methylation serum cotinine and exhaled carbon monoxide levels at multiple time points and exhaustively characterize their environments for potential confounding factors. We will analyze the resulting data with respect to the clinical variables to determine the relationship of DNA methylation to smoking related variables.  This application could have high clinical impact because it may identify a sensitive biomarker of nascent smoking in a population at high risk for complications from smoking and provide a research tool that may allow a wide range of researchers to revisit large existing data sets that focus on youth to investigate health effects of smoking exposure. It is highly feasible because our investigative team has a long history of conducting this type of longitudinal study and we are the discoverers of this biomarker of smoke exposure. It is innovative because unequivocally demonstrated sensitive biomarkers for nascent smoking do not yet exist.

"Biodefense; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the current Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic the laying of hands on the dead serves a clear mode of transmission suggesting that infectious virus is present on the skin of EBOV-infected individuals at death. While significant evidence exists that EBOV can be readily transmitted from the skin of infected individuals late during infection almost nothing is known about which skin cells support EBOV infection and how the virus passes to the skin's surface. For high titer virus to be present on the skin it is likely tht skin cells must be infected productively replicate and disseminate EBOV. Skin is a complex organ consisting of a variety of epidermal dermal and hypodermal cell types that could be susceptible to EBOV infection including keratinocytes dermal fibroblasts sebaceous gland cells sweat gland cells endothelial cells melanocytes Langerhans cells and subcutaneous adipocytes. To readily pass to the surface of intact skin the virus would need to either infect th epidermal keratinocytes directly or pass through the epidermis through sebaceous or sweat gland secretion. Yet it is unknown whether cells that compose the glands or epidermal keratinocytes are permissive for EBOV. We hypothesize that at late times during EBOV infection subsurface cells such as macrophages and endothelial cells may transmit virus to either keratinocytes or glands where they support EBOV replication and are involved in producing EBOV found on the surface of the skin. In aim 1 we propose studies to define which skin cells support EBOV infection. Our expertise in EBOV entry (Maury Laboratory) and skin cell culture and immortalization (Klingelhutz Laboratory) will be important for the success of this work. Already in preliminary studies using a BSL2 model of EBOV infection we have shown that human epidermal keratinocytes are susceptible to EBOV infection and spread. We will further characterize which other skin cell types can be infected by EBOV in monolayers 3D organotypic cultures and human skin explants. Collaborations are also in place to determine which skin cells are infected by EBOV in macaques. Studies in aim 2 will determine which surface receptors are used by EBOV in the skin cells. Understanding how virus is passed to the skin's surface is likely to provide impetus to improve safety practices used by health care workers and alter burial practices to prevent spread. Importantly our studies will point to new avenues for the development of anti-infective agents and anti-viral therapies.      ","Adherence;Adipocytes;African;Anti-Infective Agents;Antiviral Therapy;Biopsy;Blood;Blood Circulation;Burial;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cell Surface Receptors;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cessation of life;Collaborations;Communities;Complex;Country;Cultured Cells;Dermal;Development;Disease Outbreaks;Documentation;Ebola virus;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Epidemic;Epidermis;Exanthema;Extravasation;Fibroblasts;Filovirus;Gland;Glycoproteins;Health Personnel;Healthcare;Human;Individual;Infection;Infectious Skin Diseases;Kinetics;Knowledge;Laboratories;Langerhans cell;Laying-on-of-Hands;Life Cycle Stages;Liquid substance;Location;Macaca;Mediating;Modeling;Organ;Patients;Persons;Population;Production;Public Health;Reporting;Route;Sampling;Sebaceous Glands;Sierra Leone;Skin;Supporting Cell;Surface;Sweat;Sweat Glands;Sweating;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Viral;Viral Antigens;Virus;Virus Diseases;Virus Replication;Virus-Cell Membrane Interaction;Woman;Work;cell immortalization;cell type;expectation;immortalized cell;improved;indexing;keratinocyte;macrophage;melanocyte;monolayer;prevent;public health relevance;receptor;safety practice;subcutaneous;success;three dimensional cell culture;transmission process;viral RNA;viral transmission","Understanding Ebola virus replication and spread in skin","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Evidence from the current West African epidemic of Ebola virus indicates that the virus is found on the skin of patients late during infection and after deah suggesting that the skin supports Ebola virus infection yet filovirus infection of this organ is vry poorly studied.

"Anorexia; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Eating Disorders; Genetics; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Nutrition","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are severe debilitating forms of eating disorders (EDs) characterized by significant disturbances in eating behavior and by distress or excessive concern about body shape or weight. While EDs have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness and are frequently co-morbid with anxiety disorders and depression the underlying neurobiological basis of EDs remain poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular and neuronal basis of EDs and to use this knowledge to develop better treatment strategies. Understanding the neurobiological basis of EDs has been limited due to lack of a reliable animal model of the disease. Through a comprehensive genetic screening in large families severely affected by EDs we have recently discovered a deleterious rare missense mutation (A786T) in the histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) gene that causes a gain-of-function in the HDAC4 protein and co-segregate with EDs. In order to precisely examine the role of this human genetic variant in developing an ED we had a targeted knock-in (KI) mouse line generated by introducing the human mutation into the mouse Hdac4 gene to generate a point mutation at the corresponding site of the mouse Hdac4 protein (A778T). The rationale for this proposed research is that comprehensive characterization of this unique humanized mouse will confirm the face validity of the model to study eating disorder-related behaviors which will help to identify a novel biological pathway that could potentially betargeted in the future for a therapeutic intervention. The central hypothesis is that Hdac4-A778T KI mice mimicking the human genetic risk of developing EDs will display some behavioral phenotypes relevant to EDs. To this end the following Specific Aims have been generated: 1) Determine if the HDAC4-A778T mutation in mice affects food-associated behavioral tasks relevant to EDs; and 2) Determine if the HDAC4-A778T mutation in mice affects compulsivity and emotional behaviors relevant to EDs. The proposed research is innovative as it will for the first time combine the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Matrix recently developed by the NIMH with a novel humanized animal model of EDs to confirm the face validity. The proposed research is also significant because the work to be carried out in this research proposal is the critical first step in a continuum of research investigating the neurobiological basis of EDs at th molecular cellular and brain circuitry levels. Given the established genetic link between HDAC4 and EDs the behavioral dimensions under investigation are expected to enhance our understanding and inform better treatments for these disorders.      ","Affect;Affective;Alleles;Animal Disease Models;Animal Model;Anorexia;Anorexia Nervosa;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological;Body Image;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Brain;Breeding;Bulimia;Clinical Management;Cognitive;Consumption;Dependovirus;Dimensions;Disease;Distress;Eating;Eating Behavior;Eating Disorders;Environmental Risk Factor;Face;Family;Female;Female Adolescents;Food;Future;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Risk;Genetic Screening;Genetic study;Goals;Grooming;HDAC4 gene;Heterozygote;High Fat Diet;Histone Deacetylase;Homeostasis;Human;Human Genetics;In Vitro;Investigation;Knock-in;Knock-in Mouse;Knowledge;Link;Medial;Mediating;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Missense Mutation;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;National Institute of Mental Health;Neuraxis;Neurobiology;Neurologic;Neurons;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Phenotype;Point Mutation;Prefrontal Cortex;Prevalence;Process;Proteins;Psyche structure;Regulation;Repression;Research;Research Domain Criteria;Research Proposals;Risk;Role;Shapes;Site;Substance abuse problem;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Variant;Weight;Weight Gain;Wild Type Mouse;Work;base;brain circuitry;emotional behavior;estrogen-related receptor;gain of function;genetic variant;humanized mouse;improved;in vivo;innovation;insight;knockout gene;male;mortality;mouse model;neurotransmission;novel;overexpression;preference;public health relevance;pup;synaptic function;theories;transmission process;treatment strategy;trend","Behavioral characterization of humanized mouse model of eating disorder","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are severe debilitating eating disorders with the highest mortality rate of any mental illnesses.

"Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Diabetes","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a 5 year project which will facilitate my career goals to become an independent investigator. I put forth a training and career development plan which includes a research proposal with strong implications on the understanding of muscle physiology and human disease training in laboratory techniques and fundamental seminars to aide in research strategy and career development. I will be mentored by Dr. C. Ronald Kahn a world leader in the field of insulin signaling who has trained greater than 160 scientists many of whom are leaders in their field. Additionally I have assembled an excellent committee for scientific and career advice. I will train at Joslin Diabetes Center an affiliate of Harvard an epicenter of excellent research. The goal of my project is to understand the role of IGF-1 and insulin signaling in muscle protein metabolism and mitochondrial function. Muscle insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction are hallmarks of type 2 diabetes but also occur in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and critical illness. Muscle atrophy associated with these conditions is detrimental to health. Signaling via the insulin receptor (IR) and the closely related IGF-1 receptor (IGFR) enhances protein synthesis and inhibits degradation yet the relative contribution and mechanisms by which insulin or IGF-1 signaling inhibits muscle atrophy or alters mitochondrial function under normal and diabetic conditions have not been fully elucidated. My preliminary data show that loss of both IR and IGFR in muscle dramatically decreases muscle size increases markers of autophagy and impairs muscle function in the absence of altered glucose homeostasis. Aim 1 will decipher the relative roles of IR or IGFR signaling on muscle protein metabolism and autophagy. Aim 2 will discover the downstream targets of IR/IGFR signaling that mediate the alterations in protein turnover and autophagocytic flux in response to diabetes and muscle insulin resistance. Aim 3 will determine the role of altered IR and IGFR signaling on muscle mitochondrial function and autophagocytic clearance of mitochondria or ""mitophagy"". This study will elucidate the roles of insulin resistance alteredIGF-1 signaling and diabetes on muscle protein metabolism and hopefully identify therapeutic targets to both decrease muscle atrophy and enhance mitochondrial function.","Affect;Amino Acids;Atrophic;Autophagocytosis;Complement;Critical Illness;Data;Development Plans;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic mouse;Disease;Exhibits;Fasting;Functional disorder;Genus Hippocampus;Goals;Health;Hormones;In Vitro;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;Insulin Resistance;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Insulin-Like Growth Factor I;Insulin-Like-Growth Factor I Receptor;Label;Laboratories;Lysosomes;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Mentors;Metabolic;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Proteins;Modeling;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Fibers;Muscle Proteins;Muscle Weakness;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Myoblasts;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Nuclear;Obesity;Pathway interactions;Physiology;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;Receptor Signaling;Recycling;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Proposals;Role;Scientist;Sepsis;Serum;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Skeletal Muscle;Staining method;Stains;Starvation;Techniques;Testing;Time;Training;Transfection;Ubiquitin;blood glucose regulation;career;career development;diabetic;glucose disposal;human disease;in vivo;insulin signaling;knock-down;mitochondrial dysfunction;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;muscle form;prevent;protein degradation;protein metabolism;receptor;receptor-mediated signaling;research study;response;small hairpin RNA;therapeutic target","Regulation of Muscle Autophagy and Mitophagy by Insulin and IGF-1 Signaling","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Uncontrolled diabetes and insulin-resistant states are associated with muscular dysfunction and even muscular atrophy which can have a significant impact on health.

This proposal will determine how insulin and IGF-1 control autophagy and mitophagy in skeletal muscle to provide a better understanding of the muscular abnormalities that occur with diabetes and insulin resistance.","NIDDK","9088456","7/20/2016","PA-11-193","7K08DK100543-04","7","K08","DK","100543","04","","SPAIN, LISA M","9/5/2013","6/30/2018","Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases B Study Section[DDK-B]"," ","10941056","O'NEILL, BRIAN TIMOTHY","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," ","847","Other Research-Related","2016","143254"," ","NIDDK","132643","10611"," ","143254",
"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Nanotechnology; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nearly half of adults have periodontitis an inflammatory disease affecting the tissues that surround and support the teeth. The prevalence of periodontitis further increases in aged populations and in individuals with diabetes or history of smoking. It has been reported that approximately 50% of periodontitis patients aged 30 years and older have been reported to have alveolar bone loss that may lead to tooth loss and osseointegration failure of dental implants. Although current pharmacological therapies have been useful in the treatment of systemic osteoporosis these treatments have limited efficacy for treating periodontitis-associated alveolar bone loss. Osteoimmunology has demonstrated that the imbalance and dysregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and bone metabolism mediators play critical roles in the development of periodontitis-associated bone loss by activating osteoclastogenesis and impairing bone formation. MicroRNAs (miRs) small non-coding RNAs have been demonstrated to serve pro- and/or anti-inflammatory functions through modification of the activities of proinflammatory cytokines. miRs also participate in bone homeostasis by up- or down-regulating osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation. Our long-term goal is to develop a miR-based treatment that can arrest and regenerate inflammation-induced periodontal bone loss by utilizing specific miRs to inhibit inflammation and improve osteogenic differentiation. Ourobjective in this application is to establish a proof of concept in which miR-200c a member of the miR-200 family delivered using a non-viral vector can inhibit periodontitis- induced bone loss by both repressing osteoclastogenesis induced by proinflammatory molecules and bone metabolism mediators and enhancing bone formation. In this project we will determine the molecular function and potential underlying mechanism(s) of miR-200c on major proinflammatory and bone resorption factors that participate in periodontitis-induced bone loss (Study-1) and the in vivo efficacy of miR-200c delivered by a non- viral gene delivery system to inhibit periodontal bone loss in a rat model of periodontitis (Study-2). At the completion of this project it is our expectation that we will have significantly expanded our understanding of the role and underlying mechanism(s) mediated by miR-200c on osteogenic differentiation and proinflammatory and bone metabolism factors. We also seek to determine the translational capabilities of the miR-200c on re- pressing periodontal bone resorption and improving bone formation which will provide guidelines to explore a novel therapeutic strategy to treat bone lossassociated with periodontitis.","3&apos; Untranslated Regions;Adult;Affect;Alveolar Bone Loss;American;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Attenuated;Biological Markers;Bone Marrow;Bone Resorption;Cells;Data;Dendritic Cells;Dental;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Disease;Dose;Epithelial Cells;Failure;Family;Fibroblasts;Gingiva;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Homeostasis;Human;IKK alpha;IL8 gene;Immunoassay;Implant;Individual;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-6;Lead;Ligature;Lipopolysaccharides;Luciferases;Maxilla;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;MicroRNAs;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;NF-kappa B;Natural regeneration;Non-Viral Vector;Osseointegration;Osteoblasts;Osteogen;Osteogenesis;Osteoporosis;Patients;Periodontal Ligament;Periodontitis;Pharmacologic Substance;Pilot Projects;Plasmids;Play;Polyethyleneimine;Population;Prevalence;Publishing;RANTES;Rattus;Reporter;Reporting;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Smoking History;TLR2 gene;TNF gene;TNFSF11 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Tooth Loss;Tooth structure;Tumor necrosis factor receptor 11b;Untranslated RNA;Vent;aged;base;bone;bone loss;bone metabolism;bone morphogenic protein;bone resorption factor;cancer cell;clastogenesis;cytokine;expectation;gene delivery system;improved;in vivo;member;nanoparticle;non-viral gene delivery;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;oral fibroblast;osteoclastogenesis;osteogenic;osteoimmunology;overexpression;p65;prevent","A microRNA-based Approach for Periodontitis-associated Bone Loss","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will determine the molecular function and potential underlying mechanism(s) mediated by a member of the microRNA-200 family on major proinflammatory and bone factors that cause periodontitis-associated bone loss.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Neurosciences; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to fine map a gene sub-network that is robustly associated with alcohol dependence (AD). AD is extremely costly to individuals and to society in the United States and throughout the world. Family twin and adoption studies have established a genetic contribution to the risk for AD. We recently identified a sub-network of 39 genes that collectively contribute to the susceptibility for AD through the integrated analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and human protein-protein interaction networks using two GWAS datasets from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE) and the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). We replicated the association of this gene sub-network with AD in three independent samples including the European-ancestry Australian sample from the GWAS of alcohol use and alcohol use disorder in Australian Twin-Families (p = 0.006) and two samples of European-Americans (EA) (p = 0.0001) and African-Americans (AA) (p = 0.007) at Yale. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the sub-network is enriched for genes involved in cation transport synaptic transmission and transmission of nerve impulse. We now aim to refine candidate causal genes and determine candidate causal variants within the gene sub-network. To accomplish this we propose to follow up the 16 most promising candidate genes in the sub-network using targeted next-generation sequencing advanced statistical genetics and bioinformatics approaches. Our specific aims are: 1) whole gene-based targeted sequencing of candidate genes. Here we seek to identify all sequence variants including coding and noncoding for the most promising candidate genes selected from the sub-network. We will sequence the whole genes in 500 cases and 500 controls taken from the EA portion of COGA using the SureSelect Target Enrichment system and the Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence data will be analyzed and annotated using a state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipeline; 2) Identification of rare causal variants. We will use logistic regression to test the association of each low-frequency variant (0.005 < minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.05) with AD. Rare variants will also be tested for association at the gene level using advanced statistical genetic methods such as SKAT-O. We will prioritize the 384 most promising variants discovered from sequencing using both statistical evidence and functional information for replication in independent EAs (1911 AD and 1578 controls) and AAs (2232 AD and 1657 controls) using a customized GoldenGate genotyping array. We have gathered an outstanding team with expertise in statistical genetics bioinformatics human genetics and phenotyping with the goal of applying cutting-edge genomic technologies and advanced analytical strategies to advance the genetic study for AD.

"Aging; Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Health Services; Osteoporosis","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past eight years my colleagues and I have been systematically conducting patient-oriented research in the areas of osteoporosis and joint arthroplasty. In the area of osteoporosis through a series of progressive studies we have explored how best to communicate dual energy x-ray absoroptiometry (DXA) results to patients and more broadly how to communicate tests results in general to patients. Specifically we have examined how DXA testing centers can reduce ""missed"" DXA results and improve patient satisfaction and treatment of osteoporosis by mailing results directly to patients. In the area of orthopaedics we have systematically evaluated variations in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) outcomes and utilization. The objective of the current K24 Midcareer Investigator Award is to allow me to increase my mentoring of trainees in the areas of osteoporosis and orthopaedics. There is significant need for such mentoring here at the University of Iowa particularly among Internal Medicine subspecialties and Orthopaedic Surgery. We have carefully designed three projects that will advance science in the areas of: A) communication of DXA results to patients; B) evaluation of THA and TKA outcomes. The specific projects are: 1) To investigate optimal textual and graphical methods for conveying DXA results and fracture risk to patients; 2) To bring UI joint arthroplasty data into a national jointregistry being funded by AHRQ; and 3) To explore variations in joint arthroplasty outcomes and utilization in key patient subgroups including men and women and older and younger adults. Together these projects will allow mentees to be involved in cutting-edge research while being trained in qualitative and quantitative methods.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Physical Activity; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Given the rising proportion of older adults worldwide and the progressive decline in brain function with advancing age there is a pressing need to develop novel interventions that protect the aging brain. The predominant approach for implementing exercise training to improve brain function is to increase cardiovascular fitness. However there is mixed empirical support for the effectiveness of this approach. Further there are also acute effects of exercise within one hour of the cessation of a single exercise session. These effects occur before adaptations related to fitness could occur and animal studies have shown they occur in the same brain regions that benefit from longer-term exercise training. Therefore we propose the acute paradigm is a tool to probe this early direct response from exercise in order to determine how best to maximize the long-term benefit of exercise training on the aging brain. This presents a critical need to determine the mechanistic relation between acute and long-term effects of exercise on the aging brain. Our long-term goal is to determine how exercise protects the brain from the adverse effects of aging. In turn our specific objective in this R21 proposal is to support or refute the concept that a single session of exercise produces acute increases in functional synchrony of clinically relevant brain networks that are related to accrued exercise-training effects in the same brain systems. Our central hypothesis is that the effects of moderate intensity exercise will increase the functional synchrony of the hippocampus with the Default Mode Network and the Prefrontal Cortex with the Fronto- Executive Network in the same fashion as a 12-week moderate intensity exercise training program. This hypothesis is based on data showing acute effects of exercise on factors related to neuronal plasticity and excitability in the same brain regions that show long-term effects of exercise in animals. The contribution of the proposed research is significant because it will determine the extent to which the acute exercise paradigm can provide insight into how regular exercise protects the brain from adverse effects of aging. The proposed research is innovative because for the first time we will examine the overlapping neural systems and outcomes associated with acute and chronic exercise in the same individuals. Overall success in this project will enable future research to study how varying exercise parameters such as mode or intensity affect exercise-induced change in brain function and the timecourse of these effects as well as the neurobiological mechanisms associated with the direct effects of exercise on the aging brain.","Accounting;Acute;Adult;Adverse effects;Affect;Age;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s disease risk;Animals;Biological Markers;Blood Volume;Brain;Brain region;Cardiovascular system;Chronic;Cognition;Cognitive;Data;Dose;Effectiveness;Elderly;Episodic memory;Exercise;Foundations;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Goals;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Hour;Human;Impaired cognition;Individual;Intervention;Knowledge;Long-Term Effects;Mediator of activation protein;Memory;Neuronal Plasticity;Outcome;Performance;Prefrontal Cortex;Randomized;Reporting;Research;Short-Term Memory;System;Testing;Time;Training;Walking;Work;age related;aging brain;base;clinically relevant;executive function;exercise intensity;exercise program;exercise training;fitness;frontal lobe;improved;innovation;insight;neurobiological mechanism;neuronal excitability;novel;novel strategies;programs;relating to nervous system;response;success;theories;tool","Bridging acute and long-term exercise effects on brain function in older adults","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although exercise is known to delay cognitive decline and decrease our risk of Alzheimer's Disease there is a lack of understanding of how exercise protects the aging brain. The proposed research takes a novel approach to this problem by testing the concept that there are acute direct effects of exercise in the same brain regions thatare affected by chronic exercise training. If we are successful the acute paradigm will allow us to determine the critical exercise parameters that modulate brain function in humans using only a single exercise dose.","NIA","9086192","2/29/2016","PA-13-303","5R21AG048170-02","5","R21","AG","048170","02","","WAGSTER, MOLLY V","6/15/2015","2/28/2018","Aging Systems and Geriatrics Study Section[ASG]"," ","9640115","VOSS, MICHELLE WEBB","Not Applicable","01","PSYCHOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2016","2/28/2018"," ","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","190157"," ","NIA","125000","65157"," ","190157",

Therapies for the eye are generally neither invasive nor systemic; and since the eye is optically transparent treatment can be monitored easily and non-invasively in living animals-a major advantage over other systems. In preclinical studies of retinal disease grafts of healthy retinal pigment epithela (RPE) can restore damaged retina. Looking ahead to clinical applications of RPE grafting we posit that RPE grafts grown from autologous stem cells (a patient's own stem cells) would be the optimal approach to develop. Nevertheless clinical use of this method awaits resolution of several knowledge gaps: Are an adult's stem cells pluripotent enough to render functional RPE grafts? Even if patient grafts are functional will in vitro culture make them antigenic? Also eve if autologous RPE grafts work will gene therapy be more effective at late stages of RP? These questions are addressed by Aims 1 2 and 3 respectively. The therapies explored here aim to repair hereditary retinal degeneration. Although in general our results will pertain to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) these studies focus on RP caused by rare mutations in membrane frizzled- related gene (MFRP). MFRP retinopathy is ideal for our studies for three reasons. First known MFRP point mutations cause an RP phenotype. In addition MFRP retinopathy has a decades-long window of opportunity for treatment: Over the life span electroretinogram (ERG) changes lag behind photoreceptor loss suggesting that despite retinal damage MFRP retinopathy patients retain sight and are likely treatable until late stages of the disease. The third reason fr choosing MFRP retinopathy is that we can take advantage of the well characterized MFRP mutant mouse line rd6 that also suffers blinding RP. For our study MFRP-deficient patient stem cells will be isolated cultured and transduced with an Adeno-Associated-virus (AAV) to express wild-type MFRP. These ""MFRP gene repaired"" patient stem cells will be differentiated into RPE and grafted into right eyes of immunodeficient (Scid) MFRP-deficient (rd6) mice. Left and right eyes will be compared for reversal of the RP phenotype. Our long-term goals are to create cell- and gene-therapy cures for hereditary retinal diseases and develop strategies that extend to other diseases. Our objective in this proposal is to find ways to use patient stem cells as a source of retinal grafts. We will test our central hypothesis that patient- derived RPE grafts repaired by AAV in vitro are already a therapeutic option.      ","Address;Animals;Autologous;Biochemical;Blindness;Cell Therapy;Cells;Childhood;Clinical;Dependovirus;Disease;Electroretinography;Engineering;Environment;Eye;Eye diseases;Genes;Goals;Graft Rejection;Hand;Histology;Human;Image;Immune;Immune system;Immunocompromised Host;In Vitro;Inbred NOD Mice;Inherited;Knowledge;Left;Life;Longevity;Macular degeneration;Membrane;Methods;Monitor;Morphology;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Natural immunosuppression;Optical Coherence Tomography;Organ;Patients;Phenotype;Photoreceptors;Pigments;Point Mutation;Proxy;Public Health;Regenerative Medicine;Research;Resolution;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Pigments;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Source;Staging;Stem cells;Structure of retinal pigment epithelium;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Viral Vector;Vision;Work;adult stem cell;advanced disease;clinical application;comparative efficacy;embryonic stem cell;eye preservation;gene repair;gene therapy;human subject;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;preclinical study;public health relevance;repaired;retinal damage;stem cell therapy;tool;tumor","Mechanistic Studies on Regenerative Medicine Approaches to Childhood Blindness","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the goal is to develop gene therapy approaches that explore in vivo gene editing and correction tools for the eye to treat retinitis pigmentosa which are inherited eye disorders that ultimately cause blindness.

"Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Genetics; Patient Safety; Prevention; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to support the career development of Dr. Alicia Gerke. Dr. Gerke's long term career goal is to become a nationally recognized clinical investigator in identifying clinical and genetic risk factors for diagnosis and prognosis of rare diseases using novel internet-based research techniques. Dr. Gerke has assembled a team of experienced mentors (Drs. James Torner Jeffrey Murray Philip Polgreen and Martha Monick) who bring expertise in complementary methodological areas and experience in nurturing young investigators. Using a recently developed national sarcoidosis registry she will describe characteristics of the disease across the nation and identify clinical and genetic markers associated with outcomes. During the award Dr. Gerke will become an expert in: 1) Patient-based investigation using internet-assisted (e-health) research 2) Advanced clinical epidemiology methods for use in internet research and 3) Identifying genetic markers of risk for disease prognosis and outcomes. These goals will be accomplished by coursework readings and research experiences guided by her mentors. Because clinical trials are difficult to perform in rare diseases such as sarcoidosis much of clinical management is dictated by expert opinion. To date the outcomes of varying diagnostic and treatment practices across the nation are largely unknown. Dr. Gerke will be using a sarcoidosis disease registry to aggregate data on a large national cohort of sarcoidosis patients in order to first understand the variability of diagnostic and treatment practices across the nation and then to identify clinical and genetic markers associated with progressive disease requiring long-term treatment. For Aim 1 Dr. Gerke will be expanding recruitment on an existing registry using internet and e-health based research approaches. Aim 2 will use registry data to define the pathways of diagnosis for sarcoidosis patients and establish risks associated with delays in diagnosis. Aim 3 will describe the treatment variability across the nation and identify treatment related practices associated with adverse outcomes. Aim 4 will be using DNA specimens from the registry biorepository to identify DNA methylation patterns that are associated with diagnosis and prognosis of patients with sarcoidosis. These projects are important to explore the characteristics of sarcoidosis patients on a national scale and identifying appropriate clinical an genetic markers of appropriate phenotypes for future clinical trials. Completion of these aims willprovide the foundation for an independent research career for Dr. Gerke. Dr. Gerke's mentors and institution are committed to her success with resources and the environment in place to facilitate her career development.","Adverse effects;Affect;African American;Age;Area;Award;Benefits and Risks;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Management;Clinical Markers;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Comorbidity;DNA;DNA Methylation;Data;Data Aggregation;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic Procedure;Disease;Environment;Epidemiologic Studies;Epidemiology;Etiology;Evaluation;Expert Opinion;Foundations;Frequencies;Future;Genetic Markers;Goals;Grant;Guidelines;Healthcare;Hospitalization;Individual;Inflammatory;Institution;Internet;Investigation;Knowledge;Life;Medical Genetics;Mentors;Methods;Monitor;Natural History;Natural immunosuppression;Online Systems;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Prognostic Factor;Prognostic Marker;Progressive Disease;Race;Rare Diseases;Reading;Registries;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Proposals;Research Technics;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;Sarcoidosis;Severities;Specimen;Staging;Steroids;Techniques;Testing;Time;Training;Treatment outcome;United States;Woman;Work;adverse outcome;base;biobank;career;career development;clinical care;clinical epidemiology;clinical risk;cohort;comparative effectiveness;cost efficient;data registry;design;disease phenotype;disease registry;disorder risk;eHealth;experience;gene environment interaction;genetic risk factor;geographic risk;improved;meetings;methylation pattern;mortality;novel;outcome forecast;personalized management;potential biomarker;success;tool;virtual","A National Registry to Support Sarcoidosis Investigations","Project Narrative Because clinical trials are difficult to perform in rare diseases such as sarcoidosis there is a lack of knowledge regarding diagnostic and treatment approaches and how to predict which patients will need prolonged therapy.

"Brain Disorders; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current understanding of the interactions between neurons and between neurons and glia required for the formation of neural circuits is incomplete. Fundamental gaps include identifying cell adhesion molecules that can generate the diversity needed to promote specific recognition between cells of the developing mammalian CNS and elucidating associated signaling pathways that regulate several key steps including elaboration of dendritic arbors and synaptogenesis. The long-term goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms that control the proper formation of neural circuits during development. The objective of this renewal application is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the gamma-Pcdhs a family of 22 cadherin superfamily adhesion molecules regulate cortical dendrite arborization. The central hypothesis is that homophilic interactions between gamma-Pcdh tetramers on cortical neurons and astrocytes promote dendrite arborization by inhibiting a PKC signaling pathway. This hypothesis is based on extensive preliminary data generated by the applicant's laboratory during the prior funding period and will be tested by pursuing 3 Specific Aims: 1) Determine the extent to which homophilic gamma -Pcdh interactions promote dendrite arborization in cortical neurons; 2) Identify roles for astrocytic gamma -Pcdhs in cortica neuron dendrite arborization; and 3) Identify intracellular signaling mech- anisms regulating the gamma -Pcdhs' role in arborization. Under Aim 1 a model resulting from preliminary in vitro assays--combinatorially diverse gamma -Pcdh cis-tetramers interact homophilically in trans--will be applied to cortical development. Neuronal gamma -Pcdh tetramer composition will be manipulated using transfection and several novel Pcdh- gamma knock-in transgenic mouse lines to directly address the role of interaction specificity in dendrite arborization. Aim 2 build on preliminary data establishing astrocytic gamma -Pcdhs as key regulators of circuit form- ation in the spinal cord. Using astrocyte-restricted Cre transgenics with conditional Pcdh- gamma mutants and knock- ins in vivo the role of astrocytic gamma -Pcdhs in dendrite arborization of cortical neurons will be delineated. Aim 3 expands on preliminary data showing that a PKC signaling pathway is inhibited by the gamma -Pcdhs to promote dendrite arborization. A C-terminal residue shared by all gamma -Pcdhs has been identified that can be phosphorylated by PKC. We hypothesize that this disrupts the gamma -Pcdhs' ability to inhibit PKC signaling via inhibition of FAK providing a signaling feedback mechanism. This will be tested using a series of point mutant and truncation Pcdh- gamma constructs in biochemical assays and neuronal cultures. The proposed research is significant because it will identify molecular mechanisms that can account for diverse cell-cell interactions driving a key step in neural circuit formationfilling an important gap in current knowledge in the field. Such information will be critical to understanding and eventually ameliorating the many neurodevelopmental disorders that involve defective dendrite development and synaptogenesis.","Accounting;Address;Adhesives;Affect;Astrocytes;Autistic Disorder;Automobile Driving;Axon;Biochemical;Biological Assay;C-terminal;Cadherins;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cell Communication;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cells;Cerebral cortex;Coculture Techniques;Cues;Data;Dendrites;Dendritic Spines;Development;Disease;Down Syndrome;Exhibits;Family;Feedback;Fragile X Syndrome;Funding;Gene Cluster;Goals;Growth;Health;Homo;Human;Human Development;In Vitro;Intellectual functioning disability;Knock-in;Knock-in Mouse;Knowledge;Laboratories;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neuroglia;Neurons;Neurosciences;PTK2 gene;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Play;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Regulation;Research;Rett Syndrome;Role;Series;Serine;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Spinal Cord;Synapses;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissue Sample;Transfection;Transgenes;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;autism spectrum disorder;base;cellular pathology;human disease;human tissue;in vitro Assay;in vivo;insight;knowledge base;mouse model;mutant;neural circuit;neuron apoptosis;neuron development;novel;synaptogenesis","Elucidating Functions of the Gamma-Protocadherins in CNS Development","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will identify molecular mechanisms that control neural circuit formation in the developing cerebral cortex a process that goes awry in a plethora of impactful human disorders including autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability.

"Clinical Research; Lung","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neutrophils the most abundant circulating white blood cells in the human body patrol the capillary networks of the lung monitoring the airspace. Here they provide the first line of defense against invading pathogens and toxin exposures. While neutrophil migration is essential for pathogen elimination in the lung inadvertent targetingof these cells to the airspace can result in life threatening lung damage. The long term goal of this research is to identify the molecular pathways utilized during TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1) dependent neutrophil migration into the airspace and leverage this information to develop therapeutic tools to prevent neutrophil-driven lung injury. TREM-1 initially discovered on human neutrophils and monocytes serves as a critical amplifier of immune signaling. We recently discovered that neutrophil TREM-1 is required for transepithelial migration into the lung following gram negative infection. In addition to its established role in te amplification of inflammatory signaling these findings identified a novel role for TREM-1 in neutrophil migration. During our characterization of human neutrophil migration we identified a novel TREM-1 splice variant (TREM-1sv) protein stored in primary and secondary granules. This splice isoform is released during transepithelial migration. We also found in pilot studies that inhibition of extracellular ROS attenuates neutrophil transepithelial migration and TREM-1 deficient neutrophils have reduced mitochondrial ROS production. In addition to a membrane isoform of TREM-1 a soluble form of the receptor has been described in human disease. However the origin and function of this soluble molecule remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that neutrophil mitochondrial ROS and TREM-1sv modulate TREM-1 dependent transepithelial migration in the lung and that mitochondrial ROS is required for TREM-1 mediated migration. To test our hypothesis we propose the following specific aims. 1. Determine if mitochondrial ROS is required for TREM-1 mediated neutrophil transepithelial migration. The goal of these studies is to investigate if pharmacologic and genetic modulation of mitochondrial ROS alters transepithelial migration. 2.

"Cancer","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Metastatic melanoma has a dismal prognosis with 10-year survival rates of < 10%. A major underlying reason for this is that no systemic treatment provides durable benefit due to development of resistance to current therapies. A new potential strategy for treating melanoma is proposed that exploits differences in oxidative metabolism between cancerous and non-malignant cells to selectively kill melanoma cells. This new mitochondrial-targeted intervention utilizes a class of small molecules based on triphenylphosphonium (TPP) to selectively increase superoxide levels and oxidative stress-induced melanoma cell killing relative to normal cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that TPP-based compounds can be designed to selectively kill melanoma cells relative to normal melanocytes. We further show that TPP-based compounds can be designed to promote melanoma cell death via increased oxidative stress and that the effect can be enhanced with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism. In addition orally-administered 10-TPP significantly suppressed melanoma tumor growth in mice with no measurable toxicity. This research is innovative because no other therapy targets differences in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in melanoma cells vs normal cells to selectively kill melanoma cells. This research is significant because the success of these aims can result in a new treatment paradigm for metastatic melanoma that can potentially provide durable benefit to patients. The central hypothesis is that TPP-based therapies can be developed to selectively kill melanoma cells relative to non-malignant cells by exploiting differences in oxidative metabolism of melanoma cells relative to non-malignant cells. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: SA1: Identify TPP structure activity relationships (SAR) and mechanisms that selectively promote cell death and increase oxidative stress in melanoma cells relative to non-malignant melanocytes. SA2: Determine the potential for TPP based drugs to selectively enhance melanoma cell killing when combined with standard clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents and/or inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism. SA3: Identify TPP SAR as well as routes of administration that could result in the development of effective combined-modality therapies for human melanomas in xenograft models. Successful completion of these studies will identify key design traits of TPP-drugs that selectively promote melanoma cell death vs. normal melanocytes as well as establish a detailed mechanistic understanding of TPP-based combination therapies that can ultimately lead to well-tolerated protocols for treating metastatic melanoma that can be advanced to human clinical trials.","Antioxidants;Apoptosis;Auranofin;BRAF gene;Biological Assay;Buthionine Sulfoximine;Cancerous;Cell Death;Cell Death Inhibition;Cell Respiration;Cells;Clinical Trials;Combination Drug Therapy;Combined Modality Therapy;Complex;DNA Sequence Alteration;Dacarbazine;Data;Development;Disease;Drug Kinetics;Drug resistance;Effectiveness;Electron Transport;FDA approved;Glucose;Glutathione Disulfide;Health;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;In Situ Nick-End Labeling;In Vitro;Incidence;Intervention;Intraperitoneal Injections;Killings;Lead;Measurable;Melanoma Cell;Metabolism;Metastatic Melanoma;Methods;Mitochondria;Mus;Necrosis;Non-Malignant;Normal Cell;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oral;Organ;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacodynamics;Protocols documentation;Radiolabeled;Research;Resistance development;Route;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Superoxides;Survival Rate;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Toxic effect;Treatment Efficacy;Trypan Blue;Variant;Xenograft Model;base;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;cell killing;chemotherapeutic agent;clinically relevant;cytotoxicity;design;drug mechanism;drug structure;effective therapy;falls;glucose metabolism;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;melanocyte;melanoma;mitochondrial membrane;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutics;outcome forecast;oxidation;oxidative damage;radiotracer;research study;response;small molecule;standard measure;standard of care;success;targeted treatment;trait;tumor;tumor growth","Mitochondrial Targeted Metastatic Melanoma Therapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Emerging evidence of fundamental differences in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism between cancer cells and normal cells has led to the hypothesis that therapeutic agents that selectively target tumor cell mitochondria could be designed to provide effective therapy for metastatic melanoma.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vocal communication is a vital aspect of human life. This complex behavior requires integration of the auditory feedback produced during speaking to optimize ongoing vocal production. Significant public health burden arises when vocal communication and the requisite sensorimotor integration occurring during vocalization are impaired. For example diseases such as stuttering aphasia schizophrenia and autism are felt to involve disordered sensorimotor integration. In order to develop better treatments for the millions of Americans suffering from these common diseases it is necessary to understand the functional organization of the vocal sensorimotor brain network.  Previous studies in other species suggest two parallel systems of vocal production- one involving anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and one involving the laryngeal motor cortex (LMC). The functions of each of these areas and the connectivity between them are not known in humans. We will utilize complementary experimental techniques in human neurosurgery patients to overcome long-standing barriers of research progress and improve our understanding of the role of ACC and LMC in the vocal sensorimotor network.  Our techniques will include functional brain imaging (MRI) high-resolution direct brain recordings and reversible perturbation of cortical function through brain stimulation and cooling to define ACC LMC and auditory cortical vocalization-related physiology. We will also delineate the network connectivity between these regions. These techniques will test our hypotheses that ACC and LMC are critical to predictive coding and error detection and correction mechanisms involved in vocal control.  To our knowledge this data will be the first of its kind to directly define and test human ACC and LMC vocalization-specific responses. Such knowledge will provide mechanistic insights that cannot be obtained using other techniques and will guide development of new treatments of impaired vocal communication.      ","Address;Affect;American;Anterior;Aphasia;Apraxias;Area;Attenuated;Auditory;Auditory area;Autistic Disorder;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Brain imaging;Characteristics;Clinical;Code;Communication;Complex;Data;Detection;Development;Disease;Dysarthria;Electric Stimulation;Epilepsy;Etiology;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Functional disorder;Human;Individual;Knowledge;Larynx;Learning;Life;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Methods;Modeling;Monkeys;Motor;Motor Cortex;Motor Pathways;Patients;Pattern;Physiology;Play;Process;Production;Property;Public Health;Quality of life;Research;Resolution;Role;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Signal Transduction;Site;Speech;Structure;Stuttering;System;Techniques;Testing;Work;auditory feedback;behavioral response;cingulate cortex;design;human subject;improved;insight;neuromechanism;neurosurgery;nonhuman primate;novel;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;relating to nervous system;research study;response;tumor;vocal control;vocalization","Neural mechanisms of vocal communication in the human brain","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired vocal communication is common and reduces quality of life for millions of Americans.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Mental Health; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Sleep Research","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every animal must distinguish sensations that arise from its own movements from those arising from stimuli in the external world (e.g. lifting your arm vs. having your arm lifted for you). This distinction between self- and other-produced movements requires precise self-monitoring. Self-monitoring is instantiated mechanistically by copies of motor commands-corollary discharges-that prepare the nervous system for the arrival of sensations triggered by self-produced movements. Corollary discharge signals can gate cancel or otherwise modify incoming sensory signals. We propose to investigate two novel aspects of corollary discharge: Its expression in early infancy and its modulation by sleep-wake state. One impetus for this proposal is the observation that in newborn rats sensory feedback from self-produced limb twitches during active (or REM) sleep triggers spindle bursts in sensorimotor cortex and increased Purkinje cell activity in cerebellar cortex. In contrast during wakefulness when vigorous self-produced limb movements typically occur cortical spindle bursts are surprisingly absent and Purkinje cells are largely silent. This paradoxical ""masking"" ofneural activity during wake suggests the novel hypothesis that corollary discharge mechanisms are regulated in a state- dependent fashion. Importantly the hundreds of thousands if not millions of twitches produced by infant rats each day during sleep trigger substantial brain activity that is ideally suited to promote activity-dependent development in the sensorimotor system.  Specific Aim 1 will characterize state-dependent neural activity in sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum across the first two postnatal weeks in rats a period of rapid change in those structures. Critically by comparing spontaneous and evoked neural activity during sleep and wake this Aim will establish two new models for exploring the neural mechanisms and developmental origins of corollary discharge. Specific Aim 2 will provide critical new data regarding sensorimotor processing in early infancy through systematic comparison of state-dependent activity in brainstem nuclei implicated in (a) the production of limb twitches (b) the reception of proprioceptive input from limbs and (c) the processing of corollary discharge. We will also test the novel hypothesis that the locus coeruleus a brainstem nucleus that is both wake-active and a primary source of norepinephrine to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum contributes to the state-dependent modulation of corollary discharge. Finally Specific Aim 3 will explore the developmental emergence of reciprocal and state-dependent modulation of sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum. Such reciprocal interactions are essential for mature sensorimotor integration throughout the brain. The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience emphasizes the need for more basic research to understand neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity. This proposal meets that need by uniquely integrating several innovative conceptual and methodological approaches to provide new insights into the functional development of critical sensorimotor systems.","Accounting;Adolescent;Adult;Animals;Autistic Disorder;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Models;Brain;Brain Stem;Cell Nucleus;Cerebellar Nuclei;Cerebellar cortex structure;Cerebellum;Cerebral cortex;Cerebrum;Child;Data;Development;Disease;Dreams;Electric Stimulation;Esthesia;Event;Eye;Foundations;Health;Human;Individual;Infant;Infant Behavior;Interdisciplinary Study;Lateral;Lifting;Limb structure;Mammals;Maps;Masks;Mediating;Mental disorders;Modeling;Monitor;Motor;Motor Cortex;Movement;Nervous system structure;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurosciences;Newborn Infant;Norepinephrine;Output;Play;Process;Production;Purkinje Cells;REM Sleep;Rattus;Red nucleus structure;Research;Role;Schizophrenia;Sensory;Sensory Process;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Sleep;Source;Stimulus;Structure;Structure of nucleus cuneatus;System;Testing;Thalamic structure;Thinking;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Ventral Lateral Thalamic Nucleus;Vibrissae;Wakefulness;Work;arm;awake;base;cognitive development;infancy;innovation;insight;limb movement;locus ceruleus structure;meetings;neurodevelopment;neuromechanism;noradrenergic;novel;postnatal;prenatal;pup;relating to nervous system;research study;response;response to injury;self organization;sensorimotor system;sensory feedback;spinal reflex","State-dependent sensory processing across early development","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience emphasizes how basic interdisciplinary research into the development of the brain and its response to injury is criticalfor advancing our understanding of the causes of the high rates of mental illness among children and adolescents.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Macular Degeneration; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to investigate the pathophysiology of choroidal degeneration in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) the most common form of untreatable central vision loss in the western world. The choroid the complex vascular system supplying the outer retina photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can now be visualized in living humans using enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT). Recent studies of the choroid by clinicians using OCT and by laboratory scientists using donor eyes suggest the choroid is a critical tissue in the pathogenesis AMD especially as it relates to degeneration of the RPE in geographic atrophy. Access to patients with AMD (from Iowa and from large multicenter eye studies) a large human donor eye collection extensive experience in histology molecular biology genetics and image processing/analysis and state-of-the-art genetics and molecular biology laboratories will provide us with a unique opportunity to uncover the critical role of the choroid in AMD. We will use human donor eyes to determine the biochemical pathways and anatomical differences occurring in eyes with AMD. This will allow us to explore the anatomic details of choroidal loss and determine the molecular basis of changes in thin choroids and eyes with AMD. We will also explore the consequences of choroidal loss on the retina in novel animal models. Finally we will leverage our extensive experience in genetics to evaluate the extent to which genes already implicated in AMD also form the basis for choroidal degeneration using very large patient cohorts. This project also has the prospect of discovering new genes that impact structural features of the choroid and AMD biology. Our experiments will lead to a better understanding of this blinding disease and pave the way for treatments that can be utilized for patients with AMD.      ","Ablation;Age;Age related macular degeneration;Anatomy;Animal Model;Appearance;Architecture;Atrophic;Beavers;Biochemical;Biochemical Pathway;Biochemistry;Biological;Biology;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Bruch&apos;s basal membrane structure;Candidate Disease Gene;Cathepsins;Cellularity;Choroid;Choroid Diseases;Collection;Complex;Data;Disease;Dropout;Eye;Fibrosis;Functional disorder;Genes;Genetic;Histology;Human;Image;Iowa;Laboratories;Laboratory Scientists;Lead;Life;Metalloproteases;Modality;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Molecular Genetics;Optical Coherence Tomography;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phenotype;Photoreceptors;Play;Research;Research Personnel;Retina;Retinal;Role;Structure;Structure of retinal pigment epithelium;Testing;Thick;Tissues;Vascular System;Vascular blood supply;Vision;Western World;base;cohort;disorder of macula of retina;experience;geographic atrophy;image processing;in vivo;insight;macula;multidisciplinary;next generation;next generation sequencing;normal aging;novel;novel therapeutics;programs;public health relevance;research study;tool;translational study","Choroidal Disease Mechanisms in AMD","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The leading cause of untreatable central vision loss in the developed world is age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

"Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Genetics","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PPAR is a ligand activated transcription factor best known for its role in regulating insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue development and expansion. There is now convincing evidence to support an important beneficial role for endothelial PPAR in the regulation of endothelial function. However little is known about the transcriptional targets for PPAR how PPAR selectively activates some targets over others and their mechanisms of action in the endothelium. Selective expression of a dominant negative mutant of PPAR in the endothelium (E-V290M) has no effect on endothelial function in aorta carotid or basilar arteries in young transgenic mice at baseline but induces severe dysfunction ifthe mice are challenged by a high fat diet Ang-II or are old. The cerebral circulation is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress in response to the interference with PPAR signaling. Conversely increased expression of wildtype PPAR specifically in the endothelium (E- PPAR-WT) reduced vasoconstriction to Ang-II. These data strongly suggest that PPAR plays a protective role in the endothelium under stressed conditions and the dysfunction resulting from PPAR impairment is caused by oxidative stress. We identified retinol-binding protein 7 (RBP7) as a PPAR target gene in the endothelium. RBP7 is an intracellular retinol binding protein belonging to the family of intracellular lipid and fatty acid-binding proteins. Expression of RBP7 is endothelial cell-specific. RBP7-deficient mice exhibit the same high fat diet-induced and Ang-II-induced phenotype as E-V290M mice which selectively express a dominant negative mutant of PPAR in the endothelium. This led us to consider the innovative concept that the beneficial effects of PPAR in the endothelium may be mediated by RBP7. Intracellular lipid and fatty acid binding proteins have been reported to bind ligands which activate other ligand activated transcription factors. Thus conceptually we hypothesize that PPAR and RBP7 may form a transcriptional regulatory loop (or hub) in endothelial cells which is required to support an antioxidant state and when impaired induces a pro-oxidant state. We will examine this concept in two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypotheses that a) the beneficial effects of wildtype PPAR over-expression in the endothelium require RBP7 b) that the effects of RBP7 are mediated by its retinol-binding and lipid transport activity and c) RBP7 is required for the PPAR- mediated anti-oxidant response including the expression and function of endothelial adiponectin. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the molecular mechanisms by which RBP7 regulates PPAR transcriptional activity by testing the hypothesis that RBP7 with its intrinsic retinol binding and nuclear translocation activity is required for transcriptional activity of PPAR.      ","Adipose tissue;All-Trans-Retinol;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antioxidants;Aorta;Binding;Biological Assay;Biology;Blood Vessels;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Carotid Arteries;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Cellular biology;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Data;Development;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Exhibits;Family;Functional disorder;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;High Fat Diet;Human;Hypertension;Impairment;Knock-in Mouse;Knock-out;Laboratories;LacZ Genes;Ligand Binding;Ligands;Lipids;Mediating;Molecular;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;Nitric Oxide;Nuclear Translocation;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;PPAR alpha;PPAR delta;PPAR gamma;PPARG gene;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Physiology;Play;RNA Interference;RXR;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Reporting;Research Personnel;Retinol Binding Proteins;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Stress;Superoxides;Techniques;Testing;Transcriptional Regulation;Transgenic Mice;Vasomotor;activating transcription factor;adiponectin;basilar artery;early onset;efficacy testing;endothelial dysfunction;fatty acid-binding proteins;genome editing;innovation;insulin sensitivity;interest;lipid transport;mutant;novel;overexpression;public health relevance;response;rosiglitazone;selective expression;transcription factor;transcriptome sequencing;vasoconstriction","Role of PPARG the PPARG Target Gene RBP7 in the Endothelium","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PAR is an important transcription factor which as anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the endothelium and provides protection against risk factors such as a high fat diet.

"Brain Disorders; Epilepsy; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Prevention; Sleep Research","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy. The majority of SUDEP cases occur at night during sleep but why this is the case in unclear. It has been proposed that a portion ofthese cases may be due to lack of adequate supervision during the nighttime and relayed resuscitation efforts following a seizure. Recent evidence suggests this is not the whole story. There are a number of physiologic changes that occur during sleep that may make sleep relatively intolerant to the additional physiologic insult of a seizure. Seizure-induced impairmentof respiratory cardiac and arousal mechanisms have all been implicated in SUDEP. All of these are subject to sleep state-dependent regulation. A large body of evidence suggests that abnormalities in signaling of the neurotransmitter serotonin are important in SUDEP. Serotonin is also regulated in a sleep state-dependent manner and is involved in the regulation of breathing cardiac activity and sleep and wakefulness and can modulate seizures. The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how seizures that occur during sleep become fatal. In pursuing this goal we will test the overarching hypothesis that serotonin is involved in regulatingthe state-dependence of seizure-induced death. In Aim 1 we will determine how seizures that occur during sleep dysregulate respiratory function. In Aim 2 we will determine how seizures that occur during sleep dysregulate arousal mechanisms. Finally in Aim 3 we will determine how REM sleep is protective against seizures. Completion of these aims will provide an understanding of how seizures that occur during sleep could be fatal and some of the findings could be directly translatable to the clinic to aid in identification of persons at risk for SUDEP and in implementation of novel prophylactic strategies. This work will additionally lay the groundwork for future projects delving deeper into these mechanisms.      ","Acidosis;Amygdaloid structure;Animal Model;Arousal;Biological Markers;Breathing;Carbon Dioxide;Cardiac;Cause of Death;Cell Nucleus;Cessation of life;Clinic;Data;Dependence;Development;Disease;Dorsal;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Functional disorder;Future;Generalized seizures;Genetic;Goals;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Impairment;Individual;Intervention;Intractable Epilepsy;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Mediating;Microdialysis;Mus;Neurons;Neurotransmitters;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persons;Physiological;Prevention strategy;Property;Publishing;REM Sleep;Refractory;Regulation;Respiratory physiology;Resuscitation;Risk;Risk Factors;Seizures;Serotonergic System;Serotonin;Serotonin Agonists;Signal Transduction;Sleep;Societies;Supervision;Testing;Transgenic Organisms;Wakefulness;Work;combat;cost;expectation;hypocretin;novel;optogenetics;prevent;prophylactic;public health relevance;respiratory;response;sudden unexpected death in epilepsy","Sleep state-dependent mechanisms of seizure-induced death","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory epilepsy and thus a devastating condition.

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type (~1383500 new cases/year) the leading cause of cancer-associated death among woman worldwide (~458400 death/year) and the 2nd most lethal cancer in the United States. One of the unforeseen consequences of mammography is the marked increase in detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage breast cancer resulting in the overtreatment for such cancers. It is important for the accurate prediction and understanding the cause of relapse which is vital for tailoring chemotherapy for early breast-cancer patients. Using a systems approach we identified CD177 as an excellent predictor for breast-cancer relapse using a published meta-dataset including 3554 patient specimens. CD177 was initially studied in neutrophils and its function in cancer progression and relapse is unknown. Here we use various approaches to study the role of CD177 in breast-cancer development and metastasis and try to understand the molecular mechanism of how CD177 regulates such process. We identified that CD177 sequesters beta-catenin to the plasma membrane of cells and prevents beta-catenin from activation. beta-catenin is a protein with several roles the most important ones being a structural protein for adherens junctions and being an important signaling molecule to mediate WNT signaling pathway. The latter is known to be critically involved in different stages of breast-cancer development. Since CD177 is an extracellular protein and linked to plasma membrane via modification we hypothesize that CD177 indirectly interacts with intracellular beta-catenin via transmembrane proteins. As such we found a protein complex that mediates the sequestration of beta-catenin to the plasma membrane a similar process as the recruitment and sequestration of beta-catenin to adherens junctions. We propose to examine the molecular mechanism how this sequestration happens in cells and during cancer development. Here are specific aims in this study: Aim 1: Examine the molecular mechanism how CD177-STX4-STXBP2 protein complex regulate -Catenin. Aim 2: Determine the role of CD177 in breast-cancer development. In addition to the proposed aims we identified that the CD177-STX4-STXBP2 gene signature can predict metastasis-free survival highlighting the potential to be developed as a prediction tool for breast cancer relapse and metastasis. Overall we expect to understand how CD177 suppresses tumor growth and/or relapse/metastasis. The positive impact is the identification of a novel CD177-STXBP2-STX4 protein complex in controlling -Catenin-mediated biological functions and in breast-cancer biology. We add a novel arm of regulatory mechanism for WNT/-Cat activation in the context of breast-cancer progression.","Adherens Junction;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biological Process;Breast Cancer Patient;Cancer Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Relapse;Cell membrane;Cell physiology;Cells;Cessation of life;Colon Carcinoma;Complex;Data;Data Set;Detection;Development;E-Cadherin;E-Cadherin Staining Method;Extracellular Protein;Felis catus;Genetic;Growth;Health;Immune;Integral Membrane Protein;Knockout Mice;Link;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Tumorigenesis;Mammography;Mediating;Membrane;Modification;Molecular;Names;Neoplasm Metastasis;Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma;Outcome Study;Patients;Process;Prognostic Marker;Proteins;Publishing;RNA;Regulation;Relapse;Research;Role;Scheme;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Solid;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Staging;Structural Genes;System;T-Lymphocyte;Transgenic Mice;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;United States;WNT Signaling Pathway;Woman;Work;arm;base;beta catenin;cancer cell;cancer type;chemotherapy;genetic signature;interest;macrophage;malignant breast neoplasm;malignant stomach neoplasm;mouse model;neutrophil;novel;outcome forecast;prevent;protein complex;relapse prediction;syntaxin;syntaxin 4;tool;tumor growth;tumor progression","CD177 suppresses breast-cancer development by inhibiting beta-catenin","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to establish CD177 as a novel breast-cancer suppressor.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number and variety of immune cell receptors and signaling pathways shown to be regulated by the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factors (TRAFs) has steadily grown in recent years. TRAF3 initially identified through its association with the CD40 receptor has emerged as an especially versatile regulator of immune processes. Previously TRAF3 was studied primarily in B lymphocytes myeloid cells and non-immune cells. However recent studies reveal that TRAF3 also plays several important and distinct roles in regulation of T lymphocyte biology although how this occurs is only startingto be unraveled. The proposed project focuses upon this knowledge gap and aims to fulfill a critical need to understand how TRAF3 regulates T cell activation. This question will be pursued in three Specific Aims to uncover: 1) The role of TRAF3 in facilitating TCR signaling. 2) The roleof TRAF3-CD28 interactions in regulation of T cell signaling and 3) The role of TRAF3 in restraining signaling to T cells by the type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR). The expected outcomes of this project are important new knowledge that will revise fundamental understanding of T cell signaling providing novel basic immunology knowledge that will in turn inform potential therapeutic applications that seek to manipulate the process of T cell activation.     ","Address;Antigen Receptors;Antigens;Autoimmune Process;B-Lymphocytes;Behavior;Biological Response Modifiers;CD28 gene;CD3 Antigens;Cell Line;Cells;Cellular biology;Communicable Diseases;Complex;Cytokine Receptors;Cytoplasm;Cytoplasmic Tail;Data;Epithelial;Family;Fibroblasts;Health;IFNAR1 gene;Immune;Immune system;Immunology;Inflammatory;Interferon Receptor;Knowledge;Lead;Ligation;Lymphocyte Biology;Mediating;Membrane;Mission;Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases;Molecular;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Nature;Organism;Outcome;PTPN22 gene;Pathway interactions;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphotransferases;Play;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;T-Cell Activation;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;TNF Receptor-Associated Factors;TNF receptor-associated factor 3;TNFRSF5 gene;Therapeutic;Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor;United States National Institutes of Health;adapter protein;cell type;cytokine;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;member;novel;overexpression;protein protein interaction;public health relevance;receptor;tumor;type I interferon receptor","Molecular regulation of T cell activation signals by TRAF3","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it investigates a new component regulating the function of T lymphocytes an immune system cell that is critical in our defenses against infectious diseases and tumors and also contributes to autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.

"Biotechnology; Cancer; Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Diagnostic Radiology; Orphan Drug; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases","During the past two decades a significant body of evidence has accumulated showing that metabolicoxidation/reduction reactions represent a significant underlying mechanism contributing to promotion andprogression of malignancy as well as a therapeutic target for selectively sensitizing cancer cells to therapeuticinterventions. Evolving in parallel has been the recognition that advanced medical imaging techniquesmeasuring metabolic changes in cancer versus normal tissues before and during therapy show great promisein allowing non-invasive quantitation and monitoring of fundamental differences in cancer cell metabolism toimprove cancer therapy. The Free Radical Metabolism and Imaging (FRMI) Program (32 full members and 9associate members) representing 3 colleges and 10 departments was formed by a merger in 2014 of formerprograms in Free Radical Cancer Biology and Tumor Imaging to take full advantage of the convergence of thescience in these two disciplines.The FRMI program has four research themes: 1) Free Radical Cancer Biology the study of fundamentaldifferences in redox biochemistry and its impact on cell signaling genetics and epigenetics in cancer biologyand therapy; 2) Redox-Based Therapeutics the development and testing of novel cancer therapeutics basedon exploiting fundamental differences in free radical metabolism to selectively eradicate cancer cells whileprotecting normal tissues; 3) Patient Outcomes and Molecular Imaging the development of novel image-guided therapy approaches for enhancing and predicting patient outcomes in cancer therapy using molecularand metabolic imaging techniques; and 4) Novel Approaches to Diagnostic Imaging the development of novelapproaches that integrate state-of-the-art functional and anatomic imaging techniques into cancer biology andtherapy.FRMI members were highly collaborative during the last period of support with a total of 250 cancer relevantpublications (2011-2015) including 53% (n=133) involving collaborations between 2 or more members of theHCCC. Of the collaborative publications 66% (n=88) were intra-programmatic and 60% (n=81) were inter-programmatic. In addition 30% (n=76) were interinstitutional with members of the program co-authoring 45publications with faculty members at other cancer centers in the United States. Ten manuscripts werepublished in high impact journals (impact factor 10). The program members were supported by $5857820 oftotal peer-reviewed funding and $2699266 of NCI funding in the last year of CCSG support. The successfulcompletion of the research initiatives pursued by FRMI would involve preclinical and clinical verification of aparadigm shifting approach for targeting oxidative metabolic processes in cancer cells as indicated by selectiveenhancement of therapeutic outcomes and implementation of new image-based approaches to predictingclinical outcomes monitoring response and guiding decision-making.","Adjuvant;Anatomy;Animal Model;Animals;Biochemistry;Biology;Biostatistics Core;Bone Marrow;Cancer Biology;Cancer Center;Cancer Center Support Grant;Cancer Patient;Carboxylic Acids;Cell Cycle;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Decision Making;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic Imaging;Discipline;Discipline of Nuclear Medicine;Epigenetic Process;Evaluation;FOLH1 gene;Faculty;Family suidae;Flow Cytometry;Free Radicals;Functional Imaging;Funding;Genetic;Genome Stability;Genomics Shared Resource;Goals;Head and Neck Cancer;Image;Imaging Techniques;Injury;Institution;Ions;Journals;Lung;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Mammalian Cell;Manuscripts;Measures;Medical Imaging;Medical Oncologist;Metabolic;Metabolism;Microscopy;Misonidazole;Mitochondria;Molecular;Monitor;NCI Center for Cancer Research;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;New Agents;Normal Cell;Normal tissue morphology;Octreotide;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Peer Review;Pelvic Cancer;Phase I Clinical Trials;Physicians;Play;Positron-Emission Tomography;Publications;Publishing;Radiation;Radiation Oncologist;Research;Research Personnel;Resource Sharing;Resources;Role;Science;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Surgical Oncologist;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Transgenic Animals;United States;Viral Vector;Work;ascorbate;base;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;cancer imaging;cancer therapy;chemoradiation;chemotherapy;college;head and neck cancer patient;image guided therapy;improved;ketogenic diet;member;molecular imaging;novel;novel strategies;pre-clinical;predict clinical outcome;predicting response;programs;radiation response;research facility;response;therapeutic development;therapeutic target;therapy outcome;tumor;tumor metabolism","Program 3: Free Radical Metabolism and Imaging","n/a","NCI","9072967","4/1/2016","PAR-13-386","2P30CA086862-16","2","P30","CA","086862","16","",""," "," ","Cancer Centers Study Section (A)[NCI-A]","7672","1891156","SPITZ, DOUGLAS ROBERT","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","32573"," ","21412","11161"," "," ",

"Cancer; Genetics","The Molecular Epidemiology Resource (MER) is a new shared research resource offeringHCCC investigators support for high quality disease-specific outcomes research. The MERoffers meticulous collection of longitudinal clinical data and biologic specimens including serumplasma and germline DNA all linkable to tumor samples catalogued in coordination with theTissue Procurement Core.The HCCC strategic planning effort identified the importance of a robust infrastructure thatfacilitates linking molecular and clinical outcomes data. The MER is a critical component of thisnew infrastructure. Because the cost of such an effort is significant the MER has focused itsefforts on disease-specific groups that have the necessary clinical and research strength toutilize the resulting data. Current disease-specific groups supported by the MER includelymphoma melanoma and sarcoma myeloma and cancers of the breast pancreas and GU.The MER is a rigorous prospective observational database linked to a biorepository. All newlydiagnosed patients with appropriate histologies as selected by the investigators are approachedabout informed consent. Following enrollment MER personnel abstract clinical informationincluding tumor stage histology lab and imaging data treatment modality treatment responseevents (progression death) and comorbidities. In general clinical information on each subject isupdated 2x/year for 3 years then annually. Psychosocial data including quality-of-life analysesare collected longitudinally. Serum plasma buffy coat and peripheral blood DNA (at diagnosisand selected longitudinal time points) are collected as is excess surgical tissue (tumor andnormal) from resections and biopsies in collaboration with the Tissue Procurement Core. Theclinical data are periodically validated to enable their readiness for analysis without investigatorsneeding to return to the medical record.Over 5000 subjects have been enrolled in the MER to date. In 2014 35 investigators of whom26 were HCCC members were asking cancer questions in collaboration with HCCC membersutilized MER materials.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer Genes and Pathways Research in the newly restructured Cancer Genes and Pathways (CGP) program focuses on the study of biologically significant genetic alterations and molecular pathways that underlie cancer development and immune surveillance. The primary goal of this basic science program is to better understand fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis and cancer immunology thereby defining new molecular entities that can be exploited as disease biomarkers and/or innovative anti-cancer therapies. This is accomplished through three overlapping research themes centered on 1) genome organization regulation and cancer gene expression 2) cellular proliferation survival and transformation and 3) tumor immunosurveillance. Key scientific achievements over the prior funding period include advances in understanding mechanisms of damaged DNA repair and replication identification and characterization of novel tumor-promoting genetic alterations and cancer gene networks development of innovative animal models of cancer and determination of pathways controlling B and T lymphocyte survival and activation. CGP membership includes 54 full and 6 associate members spanning 16 departments (10 basic science 6 clinical) across 3 colleges. Annual CGP total funding for peer-reviewed research in the last budget year was $10.36 million ($2 NCI funding) and $1.99 million for non-peer-reviewed research projects. CGP members are highly collaborative having authored or co-authored 353 cancer-related peer-reviewed publications in the past 4 years with 17% (n=59) intra-programmatic 22% (n=77) inter-programmatic and 32% (n=113) inter-institutional. 49 manuscripts appeared in high impact journals (Impact Factor >10).

The ultimate vision of our proposed research education program is to increase the number of undergraduates who enter graduate programs in Biostatistics and to maintain a solid underrepresented minority pipeline into biostatistics graduate programs. The proposal is for the University of Iowa (UI) Department of Biostatistics to recruit a diverse group of 18 trainees each year from 2016 to 2018 with focus on minority underrepresented and disadvantaged students who wouldn't have otherwise been exposed to the field of biostatistics and to train during a seven-week research education program. Recruitment will target rising seniors from colleges and universities without graduate programs or extensive undergraduate education in statistics or biostatistics graduating senior students with no commitment to a graduate program six months following our research education program and highly promising juniors with clear vision to pursue graduate degrees in biostatistics. Terminal Master's students in quantitative fields with adesire to pursue a graduate degree in biostatistics will also be encouraged to apply. Special efforts will be made to recruit a diverse student body including trainees from groups underrepresented in biomedical research. The curriculum is a four-component model based on instruction; application; exposure; and research. The research education program will be through case-based instruction of real biomedical study consisting of a classroom didactic course; computer laboratory training; invited speakers; Skype sessions; shadowing sessions; research and clinical and translational research enrichment. As initiation to quantitative biomedical research trainees will undertake biostatistics-faculty-mentored projects on biomedical research and typically with a biomedical researcher. Students will select from a pool of projects according to their interest and will be matched to a faculty mentor. Projects will be based on the analysis of biomedical data and/or the design of a biomedical experiment and/or the statistical and computational issues associated with big data. The research projects will be presented at a biostatistics final symposium at the end of the training session. Trainees will interact with biostatisticians in academia industry the pharmaceutical industry biomedical researchers biostatistics graduate students and alumni and others.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Services","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite reported economic growth and social transformations there is a national and international need to increase the number of well-trained scientists from health disparities and underrepresented populations in the fields of biomedical clinical behavioral and health services research. The overall purpose of this project by The University of Iowa is to continue to build on our history of health science research training for minority and underserved students in international settings. This program will strengthen these individuals and hopefully the host institution's capacity to conduct clinical translation and implementation research on public health and basic science areas in three emerging centers of excellence including the University of The Gambia Banjul The Gambia; the Anne Sullivan Center Lima Peru and the Center for Health Policy and Public Health at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca Romania. The specific aims of this project are to (1) encourage ten undergraduate graduate and health professions students who are from health disparities populations to pursue careers in basic science biomedical clinical and behavioral health research fields annually; (2) broaden the training of these students to encompass international health issues; (3) assist these students to participate in collaborative research initiatives with U.S. and international faculty; (4) increase cultural competency skills in the health sciences; (5)seek innovative approaches to address problems and/or hindrances associated with closing health disparities gaps; and (6) immerse the student in a research environment which provides full exposure to research activities including theoretical modeling development of hypotheses and design data collection and analysis clinical or lab activities and practical problem solvingexercises. This multi-disciplinary program will continue to focus primarily on short-term trainingand enhance the student and host country experiences through distance learning technologies and in-country workshops or oversight as much as possible by University of Iowa collaborating mentors. The program will also offer trainees opportunities for continued collaborations with both Iowa and in-country mentors with an end towards publishable research products whenever feasible.

"Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wound care procedures such as dressing changes cause moderate to severe pain in 74% of patients nearly half (36%) of whom experience severe pain (rated as 8 to 10 on a 10-point numeric rating scale). Severe pain causes substantial stress for both patient and nurse. Unfortunately the high prevalence of severe pain during WCPs is under-recognized and under-studied. To date mainstay recommendations to prevent pain during WCPs have focused on either administration of preventive and procedural analgesia or use of expensive non-adherent dressings. However it is unclear which patients to target for analgesia or expensive dressings leading to their inappropriate over or under use. Analgesics are given to only 23% of patients undergoing WCPs and dressings that may decrease pain are given to even fewer. The ability to predict which patients are likely to have severe pain during WCPs is critically needed so that they can be targeted for preventive pain control strategies including use of opioid analgesics and special dressings. Aim 1 of this study is to develop and evaluate a model to predict severe pain during WCPs. Although opioids are often given for highly painful conditions they may not be an optimal or adequate strategy for controlling pain in open wounds because they impair wound healing and could lead to wound chronicity. The arsenal of alternatives to opioids is extremely limited because the biological mechanisms that contribute to nociceptive sensitivity and high pain during WCPs are unknown. Knowledge of these mechanisms would direct the development of new effective interventions. Aim 2 is to identify these mechanisms. We have assembled an exceptional multi-disciplinary team of investigators to execute the aims of this proposal. These include investigators with expertise in: clinical research of chronic wounds (PI: Gardner) clinical (Investigator: Rakel) andbasic science (Consultant: Brennan) research of pain genomic technologies to measure wound bioburden (Investigator: Grice) and statistical analyses including receiver operating curves (Statistician: Hillis). To achieve the aims of the study a comprehensive set of wound patient and biological factors will be measured concurrently with pain during a dressing change among a sample of 450 inpatients with open wounds. A predictive model will be developed and biological mechanisms will be examined using logistic regression. The model will be evaluated using receiver operator characteristic curves. The proposed study has the potential to make significant contributions because clinicians will be able to target those patients requiring preventive pain control thereby eliminating the spiraling impact of painful procedures on nociceptor sensitization. In addition the findings will provide foundational evidence for the development of needed novel pain control strategies. The positive impact will be to optimize wound care minimize adverse effects of pain and treatment and reduce the costs associated with wound care.","Absence of pain sensation;Address;Adverse effects;Analgesics;Area;Basic Science;Biological;Biological Factors;Caring;Characteristics;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Development;Diagnostic;Dose;Economic Burden;Failure;Fatigue;Funding Opportunities;Future;Genomics;Healed;Health;High Prevalence;Human;Impaired wound healing;Individual;Infection;Infection prevention;Inflammatory;Inpatients;Intake;Knowledge;Lead;Liquid substance;Logistic Regressions;Measures;Mission;Modeling;Nociception;Nociceptors;Numeric Rating Scale;Nurses;Opioid;Opioid Analgesics;Outcome;Oxygen;Pain;Pain Research;Pain intensity;Pain management;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pneumonia;Prevention;Preventive;Procedures;Public Health;Receiver Operating Characteristics;Recommendation;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Sampling;Science;Sterile coverings;Stress;Symptoms;Technology;Work;base;chronic wound;cost;cytokine;effective intervention;experience;healing;microbial community;novel;open wound;opioid use;pain symptom;predictive modeling;prevent;sedative;symptom cluster;tool;wound","Severe Pain During Wound Care Procedures: Model and Mechanisms","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because pain control during wound care procedures is essential in order to promote thorough wound care prevent infection promote healing and prevent wound chronicity and minimize human suffering.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Nanotechnology","   DESCRIPTION:  Particle elasticity is a pivotal influence to cellular transport and thereby essential components to nanomedicine design; however nanoparticle mechanics remain under-characterized limited in scope by technology leaving this critical design space untapped and misunderstood. Left unattended this critical need continues to obscure the expedient development of next- generation nanotherapeutics. The long-term goal of this research program is to determine the key nano-mechanical properties that enable particle discrimination at the cell membrane for deliberate endocytic selection. The objective of this application is to co-polymerize a model hydrogel (N-isopropylacrylamide NIPAM) with polystyrene (PS) for tailoring a nanoparticle library of discrete size and elasticity for subsequent in vitro discrimination of thir relative influence on cellular uptake efficiency and endocytic selection. Principal to this application micro- Brillouin light scattering (-BLS) is offered as uniquely well-suited for the comprehensive characterization of nanoparticle mechanics beyond current capabilities. Our central hypothesis follows that cellular selection of endocytic mechanism arises from independent recognition of particle size and mechanics i.e. particles that are size-forbidden can be permitted entry through an alternative mechanosensitive mechanism. Our rationale for this hypothesis is based on our preliminary data indicating clear adjustment of identically sized PS (stiff) and PS-co-NIPAM (soft) particles into a macrophage cell line. It is emphasized that our approach is the first of its kind for isolating particle size and mechanics to clearly demonstrate their relative endocytic influence. To accomplish our central hypothesis our first aim is to establish -BLS as a comprehensive analytical tool for detailing nanomechanics. Our preliminary BLS spectra indicate sensitive determination of particle elasticity at the nanoscale and moreover verify the inadequacy of assuming bulk and nanoscale mechanics are the same. Our second aim emphasizes discriminating the relative influence of particle size and mechanics for endocytic entry into three model cell lines. Detailing the mechanosensitivity of endocytosis will offer significant contributions to the improved mechanistic development of host recognition in virology immunology and drug-delivery. Our innovation stems from the extension of BLS and elasticity theory to interpreting cell-nanoparticle dynamics for advanced nanomedicine design. Overall the novel design strategies that becomes available specifically through this application underscore our alignment with the NIH mission of advancing public health.","Acoustics;Biochemical;Cell Line;Cell membrane;Cell model;Cells;Cellular biology;Charge;Chemistry;Competence;Data;Development;Dimensions;Discrimination;Drug Delivery Systems;Elasticity;Endocytosis;Event;Goals;Health;Hydrogels;Immunology;In Vitro;Left;Libraries;Literature;Measures;Mechanics;Mediating;Mission;Modeling;Molecular Biology;N-isopropylacrylamide;Particle Size;Polystyrenes;Population;Property;Public Health;Research;Role;Series;Signal Transduction;Spectrum Analysis;Stimulus;Surface;System;Technology;Testing;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;analytical tool;base;design;expectation;improved;innovation;light scattering;macrophage;nano;nanomaterials;nanomechanics;nanomedicine;nanoparticle;nanoscale;nanotherapeutic;next generation;novel;particle;programs;research study;response;stem;theories;uptake;vector;virology","Detailing the mechanosensitivity of nanoparticle endocytosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Our exploratory research study investigates the critical role of small-particle mechanical properties (stiffness vs. softness) in directing particle entry into acell.

"Aging; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease are emerging as an enormous public health problem. Up to 80% of PD patients will suffer debilitating cognitive symptoms in the course of their disease. In PD patients cognitive impairments predict a malignant disease course leading to loss of employment independence driving deficits nursing home placement and death. Because PD is strongly associated with aging this problem will surge as our society ages. There are few treatments that improve PD-related cognitive symptoms. Thus there is a critical need to develop new mechanistic treatments for cognitive symptoms of PD. A challenge in developing new treatments is that there is a knowledge gap about the mechanism of PD-related cognitive symptoms. Cognitive deficits in PD patients include impaired working memory attention reasoning planning and timing. One elementary cognitive task in which PD patients are reliably impaired is interval timing. In this task subjects are presented with a stimulus and estimate its duration over several seconds. Interval timing is an ideal window into cognition in PD because this task depends on dopamine and can be readily studied in animal models. Elucidating the neural circuitry of interval timing could help close the knowledge gap about cognitive dysfunction in PD. Our preliminary data strongly implicate D1-type dopamine receptors on pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal area of the cerebral cortex in interval timing. However it is unclear precisely howprefrontal neurons influence interval timing. Here we combine highly selective and specific techniques such as optogenetics focal drug infusions and neuronal ensemble recordings to systematically interrogate the neural activity of prefrontal D1 neurons in great detail and to mapthe projections of these neurons. In Aim 1 we determine how prefrontal D1 neurons control interval timing. In Aim 2 we determine which projections of prefrontal D1 neurons control interval timing. Finally in Aim 3 we rescue interval timing deficits in animal models of PD by stimulating prefrontal D1 neurons and their projections. This work will identify key drivers of a cognitive process impaired in PD patients. Our findings could link a brain region and a receptor system to cognitive processes impaired in PD and could spur development of targeted pharmacological genetic or brain-stimulation therapies. Insights from this work could have relevance for PD as well as for other diseases involving prefrontal dopamine circuits such as schizophrenia ADHD addiction and Huntington's disease.","Affect;Age;Aging;Animal Model;Area;Attention;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Automobile Driving;Behavior;Brain;Brain region;Cerebral cortex;Cessation of life;Cognition;Cognitive deficits;Corpus striatum structure;Data;Development;Disease;Dopamine;Dopamine D1 Receptor;Dopamine Receptor;Dorsal;Employment;Genetic;Goals;Health;Huntington Disease;Impaired cognition;Infusion procedures;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Malignant - descriptor;Maps;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Neurobehavioral Manifestations;Neurons;Nursing Homes;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Public Health;Pyramidal Cells;Ramp;Rodent;Role;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Societies;Stimulus;System;Techniques;Time;Transgenic Mice;Ventral Tegmental Area;Work;addiction;cognitive control;cognitive process;cognitive task;cost;dopaminergic neuron;effective therapy;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;improved;insight;mortality;neural circuit;new therapeutic target;optogenetics;receptor;relating to nervous system;research study;time interval","Prefrontal D1 signaling and cognitive symptoms of Parkinson's disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease cause morbidity and mortality and have no effective treatments.

"Cardiovascular; Congenital Heart Disease; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A (Nav1.5) and the inward depolarizing Na+ current (INa) play a critical role in regulating the action potential of myocytes in the atrium ventricle and specialized conduction system. Mutations in SCN5A are associated with several arrhythmia phenotypes including long QT syndrome Brugada syndrome and dilated cardiomyopathy. Brugada Syndrome has also been linked to a mutation in the gene for the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like (GPD1-L) protein which is dependent on the balance of cellular NADH and NAD+ and thus the energetic state of the cell. SIRT1 is a mammalian protein lysine deacetylase which belongs to the SIRTUIN family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases. SIRT1 targets many proteins for lysine deacetylation in response to changes in the energetic state of the cell. Whether SIRT1 targets cardiac ion channels and SCN5A in particular and thus plays a role in regulating cardiac excitability is not known. Moreover potential interactions between GPD1-L the metabolic state of ventricular myocytes and SIRT1 activity are completely unexplored. This revised application is based on very novel preliminary data that SIRT1 interacts with Nav1.5 and GPD1-L to regulate INa. It hypothesizes that dynamic lysine acetylation and deacetylation is a previously undescribed post-translational modification of SCN5A that regulates INa that SIRT1-dependent deacetylation of Nav1.5 increases INa that GPD1-L mutations alter INa through changes in SIRT-mediated deacetylation of Nav1.5 and that changes in SIRT1 can modify arrhythmic risk. It will critically test these hypotheses using HEK 293 cells rat neonatal cardiac myocytes iPS-derived cardiac myocytes and transgenic mice. Deacetylation-mediated activation of Nav1.5 by SIRT1 and its modulation by GPD1-L will identify an entirely new mechanism for regulation of cardiac INa. In doing so it will open the door for pharmacologic SIRT1 activators as potential therapeutic agents in patients at risk for cardiac arrhythmias dues to inherited and acquired disturbances in cardiac INa.","Acetylation;Action Potentials;Affect;Amino Acids;Anti-Arrhythmia Agents;Arrhythmia;Brugada syndrome;Calcium;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cells;Data;Deacetylase;Deacetylation;Death Sudden Cardiac;Dilated Cardiomyopathy;Disease;Equilibrium;Family;Figs - dietary;Genes;Genetic;Glycerol-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase;Health;Heart;Heart Atrium;Heart failure;Implantable Defibrillators;Inherited;Ion Channel;Ions;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Life;Life Style;Link;Long QT Syndrome;Longevity;Lysine;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Protein Traffic;Metabolic;Mus;Muscle Cells;Mutation;Myocardial Ischemia;NADH;Neonatal;Niacinamide;Optics;Patients;Phenotype;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Protein Isoforms;Proteins;RNA Splicing;Rattus;Regulation;Research;Risk;Role;Societies;Sodium Channel;Syndrome;System;Telemetry;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Transgenic Mice;Ubiquitination;Ventricular;base;design;high risk;induced pluripotent stem cell;inhibitor/antagonist;loss of function mutation;medical complication;mortality;novel;pressure;protein protein interaction;psychologic;response;standard of care;voltage;voltage clamp","Regulation of the Cardiac Sodium Channel by SIRTUIN1","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disturbances in cardiac ion currents predispose to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

"Clinical Research; Diabetes; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Injury - Trauma - (Head and Spine); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Osteoporosis; Rehabilitation; Spinal Cord Injury","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) experience metabolic syndrome diabetes obesity pressure ulcers and cardiovascular disease at far greater rates than the general population. A rehabilitation method to prevent or reverse the systemic metabolic consequences of SCI is a pressing need. The purpose of this study is to determine the dose of muscle activity that can enhance an oxidative muscle phenotype and improve clinical markers of metabolic and bone turnover health in patients with acute SCI. The long-term goal of this research is to develop exercise-based interventions to prevent secondary health conditions such as diabetes and to ultimately protect health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Specific Aim 1: To compare changes in skeletal muscle gene regulation in individuals with acute SCI who receive high muscle force standing (HS) low muscle force standing (LS) passive standing (PS) or usual care - (no stimulation and no standing NS) for 16 weeks. We hypothesize that mRNA expression for metabolic transcription factors and for genes regulating glycolysis fatty acid oxidation tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial remodeling will support that HS and LS instigate a greater shift toward an oxidative muscle phenotype than PS or NS. A novel finding will be that LS is a powerful regulator of oxidative pathways in skeletal muscle. Specific Aim 2: To compare changes in systemic markers of metabolic health and bone turnover in individuals with SCI who receive HS LS PS or NS for 16 weeks. We hypothesize that HS and LS will demonstrate lower glucose/insulin levels and greater glucagon suppression during oral glucose challenge compared to PS and NS. HS and LS will also demonstrate lower HOMA scores hemoglobin A1c fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). LS will be an effective regulator of systemic markers of metabolism. We also hypothesize that HS will demonstrate higher serum levels of osteocalcin lower levels of type 1 collagen C-telopeptide (CTX) and lower levels of sclerostin than all other groups (HS>LS>PS>NS) indicating an anti-catabolic effect on bone. As a secondary aim we will measure secondary health conditions (SHCs) HRQOL and cost effectiveness. We expect that the HS LS and PS groups will all show a trend for improved SHCs and HRQOL compared to usual care. We also expect to see an association between metabolic improvement and improved perception of HRQOL. These observations will support that this intervention has strong feasibility for future clinical translaion.","Acute;Adherence;Back;Biological Markers;Blood Circulation;Body Weight;Bone Density;C-telopeptide;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Citric Acid Cycle;Clinical;Clinical Markers;Collagen Type I;Cyclophosphamide;Decubitus ulcer;Diabetes Mellitus;Dose;Endocrine;Equilibrium;Exercise;Fostering;Fracture;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;General Population;Glucagon;Glucose;Glycolysis;Glycosylated hemoglobin A;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Hormonal;Human;Individual;Insulin;Intervention;Investigation;Kidney Failure;Leptin;Living Costs;Measures;Metabolic;Metabolic Marker;Metabolic syndrome;Metabolism;Methods;Mitochondria;Molecular;Morphology;Movement;Muscle;Muscle Contraction;Musculoskeletal;Obesity;Oral;Osteocalcin;Osteoporosis;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Paralysed;Participant;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Perception;Persons;Phenotype;Physiological;Quality of life;Rehabilitation therapy;Research;Resistance;Serum;Skeletal Muscle;Skeletal system;Spinal cord injury;Stress;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Training;Translations;adiponectin;base;bench to bedside;bone;bone loss;bone turnover;central nervous system injury;cost effectiveness;design;experience;fatty acid oxidation;fibroblast growth factor 21;glucagon-like peptide;health related quality of life;improved;mRNA Expression;molecular marker;novel;paracrine;prevent;skeletal;skeletal muscle wasting;transcription factor;treatment as usual;trend","Musculoskeletal Plasticity after Spinal Cord Injury","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The purpose of this study is to determine whether electrical muscle stimulation in standing can improve three markers of health in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI): muscle gene expression bone integrity and clinical tests for insulin and glucose balance.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A better understanding of how enzymes activate covalent bonds will be pursued via the investigation of a small enzyme that catalyzes a single C-H bond activation and these studies will be extended to a larger enzyme that catalyzes a complex cascade of covalent bond activations within a single active site. The studies aim to reveal the nature of the chemical step (bond activation) and the role of the whole protein structure and dynamics in that process. The studies will illuminate the evolutionary progressions that enhance the bond activation despite the fact that the catalytic turnover is usually rate-limited by processes other than the chemical transformation.  Four specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will follow the nature of the chemical step along the natural evolution of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from bacteria to human and from DHFR toward dihydrobiopterin reductase (DHPR) by means of directed evolution. Aim 2 will examine the role of active site residues in different chemical conversions catalyzed by the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TSase) and will test experimentally an alternative reaction mechanism proposed by calculations. Aim 3 will study the relations between the chemical step and fast equilibrium dynamics (femtosecond-nanosecond) across the whole protein. Aim 4 will induce a minimal perturbation of those fast dynamics by means of isotopically heavy proteins (Born-Oppenheimer enzymes) and will explore the resultant effects on the catalyzed chemical step.  Such comprehensive studies will require a broad arsenal of experimental and theoretical tools including measurements and calculations of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs); protein crystallography and measurements of anisotropic B-factors from X-ray diffractions; NMR relaxation measurements hybrid QM/MM calculations; vibrational spectroscopy (2D-IR); and directed evolution.

"Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Heart Disease; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and insulin resistance are independent risk factors for heart failure which affects a rapidly increasing segment of the US population. The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms linking these metabolic disorders and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction prior to and in concert with heart failure. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance hyperlipidemia glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Epidemiological studies suggest that hyperinsulinemia is an independent risk factor for heart failure. In humans and mouse models the heart may retain its insulin sensitivity in terms of insulin's ability to activate IRS1 PI3K ad Akt signaling despite insulin resistance in other organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle. This hyperinsulinemia also accelerates adverse LV remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy and genetic reduction of insulin signaling in cardiomyocytes limits hypertrophic remodeling and reduces apoptosis in pressure overload thereby preserving LV function. Our recent studies reveal that hyperinsulinemia desensitizes R-mediated stimulation of cardiac contractility which represents a novel mechanism linking insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia and LV dysfunction. This proposal will therefore focus on the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia might attenuate LV contractility by directly impairing or -adrenergic () signaling. Specifically activation of cardiomyocyte insulin receptors (IR) in hyperinsulinemic states impairs  signaling via two distinct mechanisms: (1) Increased R/Gi coupling that inhibits adenylyl cyclase and cAMP production and (2) Increased expression of PDE4D that increases cAMP degradation. This multi PI proposal reflects an active collaboration by the laboratories of Evan Dale Abel (University of Iowa) and Yang Kevin Xiang (University of California -Davis). Our combined expertise in myocardial insulin signaling and myocardial adrenergic signaling will address this hypothesis in the following two specific aims. Aim 1 (Xiang). Will define the molecular mechanisms by which insulin impairs  signaling in cardiomyocytes by testing the following hypotheses: Insulin signaling increases R/Gi coupling via a complex containing R IR IRS and GRK2 that inhibits adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP generation. Insulin signaling enhances cardiac PDE4 levels via R-ERK dependent modulation of PDE4 transcription and protein turnover. Aim 2 (Abel). Will determine the physiological consequences of -IR interactions in hearts in vivo by testing the hypotheses that: Acute or chronic hyperinsulinemia will impair myocardial  signaling and reduce contractility or inotropic reserve and that hyperinsulinemia in obesity T2DM and heart failure will exacerbate cardiac dysfunction by impairing inotropic reserve. By using novel molecular biosensors to define subcellular adrenergic signaling domains in cardiomyocytes and a comprehensive array of mutant mouse models with perturbed IR or  signaling we will dissect the mechanism for IR- crosstalk that limits myocardial contractility in insulin resistant states.","ADRBK1 gene;Acute;Address;Adenylate Cyclase;Adrenergic Agents;Affect;Animals;Apoptosis;Attenuated;Biosensor;California;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiomyopathies;Chronic;Collaborations;Complex;Coupling;Cross Syndrome;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Diabetes Mellitus;Diet;Epidemiologic Studies;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Gene Targeting;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Glucose Intolerance;Goals;Health;Heart;Heart failure;Human;Hyperinsulinism;Hyperlipidemia;Hypertrophy;IRS1 gene;Impairment;Infusion procedures;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;Insulin Resistance;Iowa;Isoproterenol;Knock-out;Laboratories;Left;Left Ventricular Dysfunction;Left Ventricular Function;Left Ventricular Remodeling;Link;Liver;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Diseases;Molecular;Mus;Muscle Cells;Myocardial;Myocardial dysfunction;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Organ;Phosphorylation;Physiological;Population;Prevention;Production;Proteins;Risk Factors;Role;Series;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Testing;United States;Universities;Ventricular;Ventricular Remodeling;Yang;base;constriction;glucose uptake;in vivo;insulin sensitivity;insulin signaling;meetings;mortality;mouse model;mutant mouse model;novel;phosphodiesterase IV;phospholamban;pressure;prevent;protein degradation;response;trafficking;type I diabetic;western diet","Cardiac Dysfunction in the Met Syndrome: Cross-talk between IR and bAR Signaling","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality in the United States.

We will determine if augmented myocardial insulin signaling as a consequence of the hyperinsulinemia that develops in obesity and type 2 diabetes directly impairs the ability of adrenergic signaling to enhance cardiac contractility.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic instability plays a critical role in carcinogenesis making knowledge about the mechanisms that lead to genome rearrangements and mutagenesis a critical tool in the fight against cancer. This project is focused on a novel type of DNA synthesis migrating-bubble DNA synthesis (MiBS) which promotes bursts of genomic instability including hyper-mutagenesis translocations and copy number variations. In stark contrast to S- phase replication MiBS is initiated at a double-strand break (DSB) site rather than at a replication origin is carried out by a migrating bubble rather than by a replication fork and leads to conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA. This proposal aims to unravel the molecular mechanism of MiBS and to determine how MiBS promotes various types of genetic instabilities characteristic of human cancers. To study MiBS we will use a dependable and powerful system in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae where a single DSB initiated by a site-specific HO endonuclease is repaired by break-induced replication (BIR) an important DSB repair pathway which proceeds through MiBS. More specifically a DSB is repaired by invasion of one free end of broken DNA into the homologous chromosome followed by DNA synthesis mediated by MiBS that proceeds for approximately 100 kilobases to the end of the homologue resulting in a repaired molecule with a normal telomere. We will use direct physical methods including two-dimensional gel electrophoresis dynamic molecular combing and electron microscopy to determine the mechanism of MiBS and to characterize the roles of replication proteins that are responsible for it. We will further determine the mechanism of increased mutagenesis promoted by MiBS employ sensitive genetic analyses to fully characterize the role of DNA polymerases in MiBS-associated hypermutability and assess the role of MiBS in the formation of mutation clusters using whole-genome DNA sequencing. Importantly the results of these investigations will shed light on a mechanism of regional hyper-mutability kataegis which has recently been described in various types of cancer. Finally we will determine the role of MiBS in promoting complex GCRs similar to those associated with chromothripsis a cancer-related phenomenon that involves massive genomic changes localized to a single chromosome. Preliminary results obtained in the PI's lab suggest that chromothripsis-like GCRs may occur when DSB repair switches from MiBS to microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR). The proposed research will unravel the mechanism mediating switches from MiBS to MMBIR including the role of translesion DNA polymerases in this process and will determine the role of MMBIR in formation of GCRs.

"Clinical Research; Urologic Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): While some patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) have etiologies limited to peripheral or end- organ dysfunction (e.g. bladder urethra vagina prostate and/or pelvic floor muscle dysfunction) we hypothesize that many patients have central or systemic pathophysiologic processes contributing to their symptoms. For example women and men with a history of childhood or adult trauma and those with psychological co-morbidities may represent one group of patients who have a systemic process causing or contributing to their LUTD. To better understand and develop targeted treatment approaches for patients with such central LUTD the Iowa Research Site proposes to perform multicenter and multidisciplinary research with other sites to 1) develop and test an innovative symptom-based instrument for men and women which will better characterize LUTD patients' urologic symptoms and symptom-related bother and 2) collect detailed and extensive longitudinal data (including symptom-based outcome measures and biomarkers) in men and women with LUTD to better understand phenotypic subgroups of patients. We will recruit equal numbers of men and women with clinically- and urodynamically-defined LUTD including detrusor overactivity with or without urge incontinence stress urinary incontinence and obstruction. Data collection will occur at baseline monthly and at 12 months including symptom progression and flares. Furthermore we will obtain both systemic (salivary cortisol serum C-reactive protein and resting heart rate and blood pressure) and urinary (inflammatory cytokines neurotropins stress proteins tissue remodeling proteins) biomarkers related to neuroendocrine dysfunction and systemic inflammation which may correlate with systemic vs. peripheral LUTD phenotypes.","Adaptive Behaviors;Address;Adult;Affect;Area;Biological Markers;Bladder;Blood Pressure;C-reactive protein;Characteristics;Childhood;Comorbidity;Data;Data Collection;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease regression;Etiology;Flare;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Heart Rate;Heat shock proteins;Hydrocortisone;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Information Systems;Interdisciplinary Study;Iowa;Longitudinal Studies;Lower urinary tract;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Mental Health;Methods;Neurosecretory Systems;Obstruction;Organ;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Patient Outcomes Assessments;Patients;Pelvic Floor Muscle;Peripheral;Phenotype;Process;Prostate;Psychological Impact;Questionnaires;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Rest;Salivary;Serum;Site;Stress Urinary Incontinence;Subgroup;Symptoms;Testing;Tissues;Trauma;Urethra;Urge Incontinence;Urologic Diseases;Vagina;Variant;Woman;associated symptom;base;clinical phenotype;cytokine;design;effective therapy;expectation;health related quality of life;improved;innovation;instrument;lower urinary tract symptoms;men;men&apos;s group;neurotropin;prevent;protein biomarkers;psychologic;stress protein;targeted treatment;tool;urinary;urologic","Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN)","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from this project will improve our ability to assess patients' lower urinary tract symptoms and symptom- related bother.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The study of cocaine self-administration and the reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rats has provided much knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying cocaine addiction and relapse. Yet few studies have explored the neurobiology of the extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior in rats despite the fact that extinctio provides a major potential therapeutic target in the effort to reduce relapse to cocaine use. Thus the long-term objective of the proposed work is to investigate the neural circuitry in rats mediating the suppression of cocaine seeking that develops from extinction training after cocaine self-administration. Our previous work suggests that a circuit involving the infralimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens shell is involved in the suppression of cocaine-seeking behavior findings that parallel those from human studies regarding the human homologue of the infralimbic cortex. Based on our work and others' findings we have developed a neural circuit that enables activity in the infralimbic cortex to inhibit activity in the ventral tegmental area va the rostromedial tegmental nucleus and the lateral habenula and thereby suppress cocaine seeking. The proposed experiments will examine specific parts of the neural circuit to determine their role in the suppression of cocaine seeking. In the experiments male Sprague-Dawley rats will undergo cocaine self-administration followed by extinction training and in some experiments cue-induced reinstatement testing. Aim 1 will examine whether the lateral habenula suppresses cocaine-seeking behavior after extinction training and whether it interacts with the infralimbic cortex to do so. Rats will receive bilateral microinjections of either GABA agonists to inactivate the structure or the AMPA receptor potentiator PEPA to activate the structure. The microinjections will be given into the structures either before an extinction sessio or a cue-induced reinstatement session in order to assess how the neural structures interact to suppress cocaine-seeking. Aim 2 will use a similar approach to Aim 1 in order to examine whether the rostromedial tegmental nucleus suppresses cocaine-seeking and how it interacts with the infralimbic cortex to do so. Aim 2 will also determine whether the lateral habenula and the rostromedial tegmental area interact with each other to regulate cocaine seeking. Aim 3 will use a complementary approach to examining the neural circuit underlying the suppression of cocaine-seeking. Specifically Aim 3 will use optogenetic inhibition of axonal projections from theinfralimbic cortex to determine which projection pathways from the structure are involved in the suppression of cocaine seeking. This approach is of particular importance because it can reveal the specific pathways and not just the structures themselves that are crucial to a particular behavior. Together the proposed experiments will provide converging lines of evidence regarding this novel circuit and its role in suppressing cocaine seeking. Moreover the results will furnish critical new knowledge on the neural mechanisms underlying the suppression of cocaine-seeking behavior that will enable the development of new treatments for cocaine addiction.","AMPA Receptors;Address;Amygdaloid structure;Area;Attention;Base of the Brain;Behavior;Bilateral;Cell Nucleus;Cocaine;Cocaine Dependences;Cues;Development;Drug Addiction;Drug usage;Extinction (Psychology);Functional Imaging;GABA Agonists;Habenula;Health;Homologous Gene;Human;Individual;Infusion procedures;Intercalated Cell;Knowledge;Lateral;Learning;Lighting;Mediating;Microinjections;Modeling;Neural Pathways;Neurobiology;Nucleus Accumbens;Operant Conditioning;Opsin;Optics;Output;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Prefrontal Cortex;Procedures;Process;Public Health;Rattus;Relapse;Research;Rodent;Role;Self Administration;Sprague-Dawley Rats;Stimulus;Structure;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Training;Ventral Tegmental Area;Work;base;classical conditioning;cocaine relapse;cocaine use;drug seeking behavior;improved;learning extinction;male;neural circuit;neuromechanism;novel;optogenetics;relating to nervous system;research study;response;therapeutic target","Isolating the Extinction Circuit for Cocaine Seeking","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior remains a major impediment to the successful treatment of cocaine addiction.

The purpose of the Virology Training Program at the University of Iowa is to train young scientists to be productive members of that research community. The Virology Training Grant at the University of Iowa helps in two ways. First it fosters the rigorous training of PhD students in the study of virology. Second it promotes interaction among students and faculty interested in virology across the University of Iowa. By providing stipend support and travel funds for graduate students the Training Grant will facilitat recruitment of students interested in virology. By establishing curriculum requirements that include research and literature seminars for the virology community and the collaborative teaching of virology training courses the Training Grant will promote interaction in the larger virology community at the University of Iowa and beyond. There are ten Virology Training Grant faculty who represent a wide variety of research interests from study of very basic processes in the molecular and cellular biology of virus replication to study of host animal responses to virusinfection to study of the most efficient mechanisms for gene delivery by viruses.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Contraception/Reproduction; Genetics","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Why do we senesce? This question has intrigued many perhaps since the dawn of our species. Remarkably recent work on turtles has detected no evidence of demographic senescence i.e. - no mortality and reproductive aging. Theory predicts the circumstances under which aging should evolve implying that such senescence may be evolutionarily labile and its occurrence context-dependent. While predictions from theory have been borne out in short-lived organisms under controlled conditions our understanding of the ecology and evolution of senescence in long-lived organisms in the wild where it evolved is lacking. Moreover evolutionarily conserved molecular networks underlie aging in a wide array of animal taxa (fruit flies mice nematode worms). Whether and how such genetic and cellular mechanisms underlie mortality and reproductive senescence outside of the realm of laboratory models remains unknown. Quantifying aging and the evolutionary ecological and physiological determinants of such senescence in exceptional taxa will yield valuable insights into the evolution and persistence of senescence and its co-regulation with other life-history traits.  We will investigate key aspects of the evolution ecology and genetics of aging in a wild population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) which has been studied in detail since 1988. We will answer the following questions.  1) Do these C. picta exhibit age-related declines in reproduction and increases in mortality which is evidence for senescence?  2) Are there differences between the sexes and are there long-lasting impacts of early- age experiences on late-life mortality and fertility trajectories?  3) Are sex differences and early-life impacts on aing rates context dependent?  4) Is offspring lifespan positively related to maternal age or maternal and paternal genotype thereby suggesting the inheritance of lifespan?  5) Do age-specific physiological profiles (specifically gene-expression and mitochondrial energetics) underlie mortality and reproduction trajectories similar to mammals and model genetic organisms?  We will address these questions with coordinated experimental and analytical approaches. Existing informatics and collections-based resources accumulated over the past 24 yrs. including TurtleBase - a database comprising integrated ecological environmental evolutionary and genetic information corresponding to hundreds of turtles and nests - will provide the input to an analytical pipeline for modeling the biodemography of aging. Importantly our on-the-ground turtle population has individuals of known age ranging from hatchling to maximum lifespan (ca. 25 yrs.). Samples of these individuals combined with our archived tissue and DNA bank will be leveraged to render us uniquely able to test these important questions.","Address;Age;Aging;Animals;Archives;Biological Models;Biological Process;Boxing;Cell physiology;Cessation of life;Clinical Research;Collection;Comparative Biology;Complex;DNA Library;Data;Databases;Demography;Deterioration;Drosophila genus;Ecology;Elderly;Environmental Impact;Evolution;Exhibits;Failure;Female;Fertility;Figs - dietary;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genome;Genotype;Geriatrics;Growth;Health;Heritability;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Human;Individual;Informatics;Inherited;Laboratories;Laboratory Study;Lead;Life;Life Experience;Light;Longevity;Longitudinal Studies;Mammals;Maps;Maternal Age;Measures;Mining;Mitochondria;Modeling;Molds;Molecular;Mus;Nematoda;Organ;Organism;Paint;Pattern;Phylogeny;Physiological;Population;Process;Quantitative Genetics;Regulation;Reporting;Reproduction;Reptiles;Research;Resources;Sampling;Series;Sex Characteristics;Social Environment;Specificity;Stress;Study models;Taxon;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Tissue Banking;Tissue Banks;Turtles;Variant;Vertebrates;Work;age related;base;biodemography;cohort;experience;field study;flexibility;genetic analysis;genetic evolution;genetic information;genetic pedigree;insight;life history;male;mortality;offspring;reproductive;reproductive senescence;senescence;sex;statistics;study population;theories;trait","Biodemography and senescence in long-lived painted turtles","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this proposal we develop a new vertebrate model for the study of aging; develop a new analytical framework for understanding the biodemography of aging in the context of life history theory; and test the aging profiles (mortality reproduction gene expression physiological) of an ecological model system - the painted turtle. Recent reports of turtle demography suggest that turtles may not age - i.e. they may have no mortality increases and fecundity decreases with advancing age. We will test these assertions test for the inheritance of lifespan and test for evolutionary mechanisms of senescence in a long-term study population.

"Asthma; Bioengineering; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Lung","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ultimate goal of the research is to build a new computational framework for assessment and prediction of lung function through integration of statistical analysis of population data with prediction of function in individual subjects via a muti-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) lung model for improved patient phenotyping and hence patient-specific therapy. An hypothesis motivating this research is that lung phenotypes may exhibit similar features by gender age and (normal or diseased) state thus they can be clustered into sub- populations and the structural and functional features in sub-populations may correlate with deposition of inhaled particulates and inflammation in the lungs. To achieve the goal and test the hypothesis we propose the following specific aims. (1) Perform statistical analysis of airway image-based measurements and associated covariates. (2) Perform image registration analysis to study regional ventilation tissue fraction and lung deformation. (3) Develop multi-scale subject-specific airway tree modeling and meshing algorithms for diseased lungs. (4) Apply a parallel CFD model to study airway resistance particle deposition and hot spots. Hot spots are the locations where inhaled particles toxins irritants or bacteria accumulate in the lungs. (5) Seek supportive data from human studies to demonstrate that CFD modeling predicts lung regions susceptible to inflammation associated with enhanced deposition of inhaled particulate. We propose to analyze the existing and growing huge databases such as lung computed tomography (CT) image data demographic information smoking history and pulmonary function tests collected by the NIH funded multi-center trials. Statistical methods willbe applied to cluster and classify large data sets into sub-populations. The novelty of our approach lies in fusion of both static structural and dynamic functional phenotypes into our statistical analyses including morphologic and topological airway measurements and threshold-based measurements of air trapping and emphysema extracted from a single CT lung image deformation-based functional variables derived from image registration of CT images at two lung volumes and CFD-predicted sensitive functional variables. These statistical tools will identify statistically significant phenotypes contrasting normal COPD and asthmatic subjects and identify a few subjects representative of sub-populations for multi-scale high- performance parallel CFD simulations to study flows resistance and hot spots and their correlations with theinflammations of airways and tissues. Human subject studies will be conducted using volumetric 3D lung dual energy computed tomography (DECT) and 99mTc-MPAO-labelled white blood cell (WBC) lung SPECT imaging for model validation and longitudinal studies.","Air;Airway Resistance;Algorithms;Animals;Asthma;Back;Bacteria;Breathing;Caliber;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Classification;Cluster Analysis;Data;Data Set;Databases;Deposition;Environmental air flow;Exhibits;Funding;Gender;Goals;Health;Hot Spot;Image;Individual;Inflammation;Iowa;Irritants;Label;Length;Letters;Leukocytes;Liquid substance;Lobe;Location;Longitudinal Studies;Lung;Measurement;Modeling;Multicenter Trials;Outcome Measure;Particulate;Patients;Performance;Phenotype;Photons;Population;Process;Pulmonary Emphysema;Pulmonary function tests;Radiology Specialty;Research;Resistance;Respiratory physiology;Rotation;Smoking History;Statistical Data Interpretation;Statistical Methods;Statistical Models;Stress;Structure-Activity Relationship;Techniques;Testing;Thick;Tissues;Tomography Emission-Computed Single-Photon;Toxin;Trees;United States National Institutes of Health;University Hospitals;X-Ray Computed Tomography;airway inflammation;asthmatic;asthmatic airway;base;computer cluster;computer framework;data modeling;density;genetic epidemiology;human data;human subject;image guided;image registration;improved;lung imaging;lung volume;normal aging;particle;phenotypic biomarker;programs;research study;simulation;statistics;tool;validation studies","An integrative statistics-guided image-based multi-scale lung model","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal aims to develop a new computational framework that integrates an individualized multi-scale lung model with image registration geometric modeling and statistical analyses to study structure-function relationships over a population of normal asthmatic and COPD subjects.","NHLBI","9066766","6/1/2016","PAR-11-203","4U01HL114494-04","4","U01","HL","114494","04","","GAN, WEINIU ","8/15/2013","5/31/2018","ZEB1-OSR-C(M1)"," ","8049235","LIN, CHING-LONG ","Not Applicable","01","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2016","5/31/2017"," ","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","631428"," ","NHLBI","451575","179853"," ","631428",
"Biotechnology; Cardiovascular; Congenital Heart Disease; Genetics; Heart Disease; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated sodium (NaV)- and potassium (KV)-channel proteins underlie the regulation of basal electrical excitability and the initiation and repolarization of action potentials in virtually all excitable cells. These channels have evolved from primordial K+-selective pores into diverse proteins with regulatory mechanisms that enable them to respond to specific stimuli in the nervous cardiovascular and immune systems. The importance of this protein family to human health is highlighted by the facts that: inherited or acquired defects in NaV or Kv channels cause epilepsy myotonia erythromelalgia and cardiac arrhythmias; mutations that lead to changes in the gating kinetics or expression of K+ channels in excitable tissues such as cardiac muscle can lead to arrhythmias and susceptibility to sudden cardiac death (long or short QT syndromes); and significant electrical remodeling of KV- and NaV-channel expression is observed during cardiac hypertrophy or persistent arrhythmias. Unfortunately a broad spectrum of excitability disorders remains largely untreatable and a fresh approach to closing the gap in our understanding of NaV and KV gating and selectivity will be needed if effective therapeutics are to be developed. Notably although ion channels (particularly those of the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily) have been characterized on both the macroscopic and atomic levels these studies lack the resolution needed to identify essential chemical property(s) of the amino acids that have been implicated in functional roles. The lack of such information remains a significant block to our understanding of ion permeation and channel gating and ultimately effective drug design. Here we propose to design and apply powerful synthetic tools in the form of tailor-made unnatural amino acids as a means of achieving hypothesis-driven atomic-level mutagenesis to reach a physiological endpoint: an understanding of the basis of ion selectivity and channel gating. Further although we expect to eventually be able to perform structure-based drug design no structures yet exist for eukaryotic NaVs and the work proposed here will inform us directly about which traits of bacterial NaV's (where structures are now available) are relevant to eukaryotic NaV's. Finally the results of our study will remove a significant technical barrier to an atomic-level functional understanding of the gating and permeation mechanisms employed by NaV and KV channels-two proven drug targets in the management of excitability disorders. Success of the proposed study will make it possible to generate novel amino acids that will be widely available to the research community.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Cancer; Genetics","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer incidence increases exponentially with age suggesting that a common mechanism contributes to both of these biological processes. One such mechanism is thought to be oxidative stress due to an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS e.g. O2.- and H2O2 arising from O2 metabolism) and their removal by the antioxidant network. A majority of aging-research is focused on understanding the mechanisms regulating replicative lifespan (Hayflick limit) which is attributed to telomere shortening and mitotic attrition. In the previous period of support (R01 CA111365) we discovered a novel mode of cellular aging (chronological lifespan) which is independent of both mitotic attrition and telomerase activity. We define chronological lifespan as the duration in which quiescent cells retain their capacity to re-enter the proliferative cycle and transit back toquiescence. Our data show that molecular and pharmacologically induced overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) suppresses age-associated increase in mitochondrial injury and extends chronological lifespan. We also observed that MnSOD overexpression inhibits age-associated increases in the ability of quiescent fibroblasts to stimulate the proliferation of neighboring epithelial cancer cells. Finally our recent preliminaryresults suggest that MnSOD-induced regulation of cell cycle regulatory pathways including the redox-sensitive phosphatase DUSP1 and the chemokine CCL5 could mediate chronological lifespan in human fibroblasts. These observations have now led us to test the specific hypothesis that MnSOD and ROS (O2.- and H2O2) regulate the chronological lifespan of human fibroblasts as well as their ability to influence the proliferation of epithelial cancer cells via edox-sensitive cell cycle regulatory pathways involving DUSP1 and CCL5. To investigate this hypothesis we will determine if: (a) MnSOD dependent expression of DUSP1 and CCL5 regulates the chronological lifespan of normal human fibroblasts; (b) cellular quiescence and redox-sensitive post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate MnSOD DUSP1 and CCL5 expression; and (c) the aging of quiescent fibroblasts regulates the proliferation of epithelial cancer cells in co-cultures via the secretion of CCL5. A better understanding of the redox-biology of chronological lifespan and its effect on epithelial cancer progression will be of significance to aging and cancer research because this knowledge can greatly facilitate the development of novel nutritional and antioxidant-based approaches to promote healthy aging and suppress age-related cancer progression.","3&apos; Untranslated Regions;Age;Aging;Antioxidants;Back;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological Process;Biology;Cell Aging;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Coculture Techniques;Conditioned Culture Media;Cyclin D1;Data;Development;Environment;Epithelial;Event;Excision;Fibroblasts;Flow Cytometry;G1 Phase;G2 Phase;Gene Expression;Gene Transfer;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Incidence;Injury;Knowledge;Life Style;Longevity;MAPK3 gene;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary gland;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Metabolism;MicroRNAs;Mitochondria;Mitosis;Mitotic;Molecular;Nutritional;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Production;Proteins;RANTES;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulatory Pathway;Research;S Phase;SOD2 gene;Sorting - Cell Movement;Telomerase;Telomere Shortening;Testing;Transcript;Untranslated Regions;adenoviral-mediated;age related;aged;anticancer research;base;cancer cell;cell growth;chemokine;healthy aging;innovation;novel;nutritional approach;overexpression;research study;tumor progression","Redox Biology of Quiescent Normal Fibroblasts and Epithelial Cancer Progression","An understanding of the redox-biology of chronological lifespan will be of significance to aging and cancer research because this knowledge can greatly facilitate the development of novel nutritional and antioxidant- based approaches to promote healthy aging and suppress age-related cancer progression.","NCI","9066098","3/30/2016","PA-10-067","4R01CA111365-10","4","R01","CA","111365","10","","OKANO, PAUL ","4/19/2006","5/31/2018","Cancer Etiology Study Section[CE]"," ","1877593","GOSWAMI, PRABHAT C","Not Applicable","01","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2016","5/31/2018"," ","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","208203"," ","NCI","137883","70320"," ","208203",
"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Veterinarians are well-suited for comparative and biomedical research due to their knowledge in basic physiology applied to multiple animal species and their clinical training. Veterinary specialists in biomedical and comparative research are essential for successful research at all levels and locations and a shortage of veterinarians with the background and training for biomedical research has been documented in reports by the National Academy of Sciences and is predicted to increase. The College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at Iowa State University (ISU) has a stellar history of educating veterinarians many of whom have entered careers in biomedical research. The CVM at ISU has a cooperative educational agreement with the University of Nebraska at Lincoln (UNL) whereby UNL School of Veterinary medicine educates an additional 25 students per year for two years of the veterinary curriculum. Today ISU CVM has one of the largest class sizes among U. S. Veterinary Schools and Colleges which makes an excellent pool of student trainees for recruitment into the summer scholar program. The CVM enrolls over 140 graduate students. ISU CVM research funding has increased to $17 million in 2011 with faculty members including veterinarians who receive NIH grants. Nearby ISU is the USDA/ARS-National Animal Disease Center which is the largest animal research facility in the world with veterinarians dedicated to animal research. ISU CVM began a summer scholar training program for veterinary medical students in1991 and received T35 support in 2001 with renewal in 2008. The T35 has supported 75 trainees during this time. The broader summer scholar program at ISU CVM (supported by Merial LTD Iowa Healthy Livestock Advisory Committee Morris Animal Foundation) has consistently supported 20-25 trainees for 20 years. Many of these enter biomedical research fields. The objective of the T35-supported scholar training and the overall Veterinary Medical Summer Scholars Research Program (SSRP) at Iowa State University is to expose first and second year veterinary medical students to biomedical research by direct laboratory experience and through participation in allied activities including seminars workshops journal clubs and presentations. The overall goal of the SSRP is to increase the number of scientifically-trained veterinarians that are successful as biomedical scientists. The objectives and goals are met through a 13 week summer program that includes fruitful laboratory experiences with highly engaged and qualified NIH-mentors that includes veterinarians in superb facilities; lectures and seminars on animal care ethics conflicts inter-student and mentor interactions scientific writing; and deep engagement with veterinarians as mentors in biomedical research.","Advisory Committees;Agreement;Ally;Animal Diseases;Animal Experimentation;Animals;Biomedical Research;Clinical;Conflict (Psychology);Educational Curriculum;Educational workshop;Enrollment;Ethics;Faculty;Foundations;Funding;Goals;Grant;Iowa;Journals;Knowledge;Laboratory Animal Production and Facilities;Livestock;Location;Medical;Medical Students;Mentors;NCI Scholars Program;Nebraska;Physiology;Qualifying;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research;Research Training;Schools;Specialist;Students;Time;Training;Training Programs;United States National Academy of Sciences;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Veterinarians;Veterinary Medicine;Veterinary Schools;Writing;animal care;biomedical scientist;career;college;comparative;graduate student;laboratory experience;lectures;meetings;member;programs;student mentoring;summer program;summer research","Summer Research Training for Veterinary Medical Students","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): There is a need to increase the number of veterinarians trained in biomedical research to support the nation's health.

"Genetics; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Prevention; Vaccine Related; Vaccine Related (AIDS)","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to develop and sustain memory CD8 T cells after infection or immunization is a hallmark of the adaptive immune response and one basis for protective vaccination against infectious disease or in cancer immunotherapy. Since the degree of protection to infection depends on the functional characteristics (quality) and the number (quantity) of memory CD8 T cells present at the time of pathogen exposure understanding the mechanisms that govern generation differentiation and maintenance of the memory CD8 T cell pool are critical to our ability to design the most effective vaccines. Substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the biology of memory CD8 T cells generated after acute infection or immunization. However despite this progress many important questions remain. For instance the superior protective capacity of memory CD8 T cells is closely linked to their increased abundance in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs and as a consequence much effort has been devoted to identifying strategies that increase the absolute numbers of memory CD8 T cells. Among these strategies prime-boost regimes (or multiple antigen (Ag) stimulations) are often used because of their ability to elicit large numbers of memory CD8 T cells. Importantly our recent studies demonstrated that each additional re-stimulation with Ag results not only in progressive decrease in proliferative capacity of the ensuing memory CD8 T cell populations but also change their phenotype function rate of contraction basal proliferation and ability to survive. Interestingly these functional changes ar associated with transcriptomic diversification in memory CD8 T cells after each antigen encounter. However it is unknown which key molecular mediators are responsible for each of these functional changes. Filling this knowledge gap has critical importance in order to optimize memory CD8 T cell numbers while preserving qualities that impact protection.  Our long-term goal is to fully understand the functional consequences imposed on memory CD8 T cell populations generated after one or more Ag encounters. This information will be significant in formulating the best strategies to generate and manipulate protective CD8 T cell-mediated immunity in response to vaccination. We will test the overall hypothesis that the history of Ag-stimulations is a critical determining factor controlling the function and long-term maintenance ofmemory CD8 T cell populations. We will begin to address our long- term goal through the following Specific Aim - Determine the molecular mechanisms controlling differentiation and function of memory CD8 T cells generated after repetitive antigen encounters.","Acute;Address;Antigens;Biological;Biology;CD8B1 gene;Cell Count;Cellular Immunity;Characteristics;Collaborations;Communicable Diseases;Coupled;Data;Disease;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Generations;Goals;Health;Immunity;Immunization;Infection;Knowledge;Link;Lymphoid;Maintenance;Manuscripts;Mediator of activation protein;Memory;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Molecular Genetics;Organ;Paper;Phenotype;Play;Population;Publishing;Recording of previous events;Research Personnel;Role;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Vaccination;Vaccines;adaptive immunity;base;cancer immunotherapy;design;gain of function;genetic manipulation;in vivo;loss of function;mouse model;overexpression;pathogen;pathogen exposure;response;transcription factor;transcriptome;transcriptomics","Molecular mechanisms controlling differentiation of memory CD8 T cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Memory CD8 T cells are generated after infections or vaccination and can protect the host from re-infection with the same pathogen.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; HIV/AIDS; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Vaccine Related","   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Antigenic variation is an immune-evasive defensive strategy commonly exploited by many viruses. Antigenically variable viruses (AVV) are responsible for many human as well as veterinary diseases with high morbidity/mortality and significant economic losses worldwide. Viruses such as HIV-1 influenza virus and PRRSV (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus) are notorious examples and they epitomize the next level of scientific challenge that mankind faces in a fight against infectious diseases. Considering the enormity of the scientific challenges of antigenic variation we believe more cross-disciplinary efforts mustbe made to share new advances in various scientific disciplines exchange novel concepts and to   foster new collaborations between not only those who work on same viruses but also among investigators who work on different viruses or different disciplines. In June 2014 we hosted the first Symposium on Vaccines Against Antigenically Variable Viruses (VAAVV). The symposium was well attended which indicated (1) the uniqueness of the symposium (2) scientific importance of the topic and (3) significant need for the symposium to move the field forward. To continue the momentum we are proposing to hold two additional symposia in 2015 and 2016. The major purpose of holding the symposia dedicated to developing VAAVV is to establish a strong network of investigators for conducting highly collaborative integrative and interdisciplinary research. This will establish the scientific foundation to develop novel strategis and make strides toward a long-term goal of producing efficacious and cost-effective vaccines against these viruses. We believe our symposium is unique in that it focuses primarily on the topic of ""antigenic variation"" rather than a specific virus. To our knowledge there are no comparable meetings that bring together investigators who work on different viruses focusing on this important topic. Considering the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations the symposium will be proactive in facilitating interactions among participants by providing ""collaboration corners"" with dedicated time and spaces for attendees to have opportunities to interact directly with speakers. We will also arrange ""scientific speed dating"" among attendees to facilitate interactions and to foster collaborative research. In this Symposium participants wil share discuss and debate many problems associated with developing effective VAAVV focusing especially on HIV-1 influenza virus and PRRSV. Many topics will be discussed including current understanding immune correlates of protection new insights from computational- structuraland systems-biology for rational immunogen design and novel strategies for enhancing potency and breadth of immune responses. The specific Aim of the proposal is: To provide an effective venue that would allow sharing of state-of-the-art knowledge and exchange of innovative ideas that could facilitate interdisciplinary research and foster collaboration in order to overcome the problem of antigenic variation in vaccine development.      ","Academia;Address;Antigenic Variation;Antigens;Biomedical Engineering;Cellular Immunology;Collaborations;Communicable Diseases;Defense Mechanisms;Discipline;Disease;Economics;Epidemiologist;Epitopes;Face;Family;Fostering;Foundations;Funding;Goals;Government;HIV Envelope Protein gp120;HIV-1;HIV-1 vaccine;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunization;Immunoassay;Immunologist;Industry;Influenza;Interdisciplinary Study;International;Iowa;Knowledge;Measles;Morbidity - disease rate;Participant;Play;Poliomyelitis;Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Smallpox;Speed;Structural Biologist;Systems Biology;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Update;Vaccination;Vaccines;Virus;Work;antigen processing;cost effective;design;fight against;immunogenicity;influenzavirus;innovation;insight;interdisciplinary collaboration;meetings;mortality;novel;novel strategies;novel vaccines;public health relevance;structural biology;symposium;vaccine delivery;vaccine development;vaccinology;virology;web site","Vaccines Against Antigenically Variable Viruses Symposium","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Antigenic variation is a defensive strategy commonly exploited by many viruses to hide from the body's immune system.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Peripheral Neuropathy","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Activity-dependent changes in gene expression in nociceptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pain. These changes are triggered by increased electrical activity following tissue or nerve injury or inflammation. Dozens of genes associated with the development of persistent pain have been identified (e.g. ion channels receptors and neuromodulators). Pharmacological targeting of the expression of groups of genes that depend on common transcription factors may allow preventing the development or maintenance of chronic pain states. Yet the specific mechanisms and transcription factors responsible for activity-dependent gene regulation in nociceptors are largely unknown. Ca2+ and Ca2+-dependent transcription factors play key roles in excitation- transcription coupling in neurons. Here we focus on the Ca2+-dependent transcription factor NFAT as an attractive candidate for regulating gene expression in nociceptors for the following reasons. First four NFAT isoforms (NFATc1-c4; NFATc3 being the predominant) are expressed in DRG neurons and regulated by action potentials and pain producing compounds such as capsaicin bradykinin and NGF. Second NFAT is highly sensitive to [Ca2+]i elevations in DRG neurons (activation trheshold~300 nM) mediated by Ca2+ entry via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and TRPV1 receptors. Third NFAT regulates the expression of a number of genes implicated in pain such as COX-2 BDNF GluA2 IL-6 chemokine receptor CCR2 and based on our pilot data CGRP and voltage-gated Na+ channel Nav1.7. Fourth our preliminary studies using NFATc3 KO mice indicate that NFATc3 contributes to inflammation-induced pain sensitization. Collectively these observations suggest that NFAT plays an important role in pain control. However the roles of specific NFAT isoforms in this process and the underlying mechanisms are not known. We hypothesize that NFATc3 plays a critical role in activity-dependent gene regulation in DRG neurons which contributes to inflammation- and injury-induced nociceptor sensitization and to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will examine the functional significance of NFATc3 in pain hypersensitivity following inflammation tissue and nerve injury by comparing thermal and mechanical sensitization in WT and NFATc3 KO (complete and sensory-neuron-specific KO) mice using models of persistent pain produced by inflammation (intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant/CFA) tissue injury (postincisional pain) and nerve injury (spared nerve injury/SNI) respectively. In Aim 2 we will establish the role of NFATc3 in regulating the expression of two important molecules implicated in pain CGRP and Nav1.7 by testing the effects of depolarization on the expression of CGRP and Nav1.7 in DRG neurons from WT and NFATc3 KO mice. These studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms that control activity- dependent gene regulation in nociceptors and pain sensitization and are expected to lead to the development of new strategies for alleviating pain by targeting specific NFAT isoforms and their regulatory mechanisms.      RELEVANCE: Pain management remains one of the most serious public health problems. The proposed studies will help to better understand how the activity-dependent gene regulation in primary nociceptors and specifically the Ca2+ -dependent transcription factor NFAT contribute to the pathogenesis of pain caused by surgical trauma inflammation or nerve injury and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting NFAT and the associated signaling mechanisms to alleviate pain.","Action Potentials;Afferent Neurons;Applications Grants;Binding;Biological Assay;Bradykinin;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor;Calcineurin;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Capsaicin;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Coupling;Data;Development;Freund&apos;s Adjuvant;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Regulation;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Hypersensitivity;Immune;Immunoassay;Inflammation;Injection of therapeutic agent;Injury;Interleukin-6;Ion Channel;Knock-out;Knockout Mice;Label;Lead;Luciferases;Maintenance;Mechanics;Mediating;Modeling;Monitor;Muscle Cells;Mutate;Neuromodulator Receptors;Neurons;Nociception;Nociceptors;Nuclear Localization Signal;Operative Surgical Procedures;PTGS2 gene;Pain;Pain management;Pathogenesis;Persistent pain;Play;Process;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein Isoforms;Protein phosphatase;Public Health;Regulation;Reporter;Reporter Genes;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Role;Signal Transduction;Spinal Ganglia;Surgical incisions;T-Cell Activation;TRPV1 gene;Testing;Tissues;Transcription Initiation;Trauma;Western Blotting;Work;base;cell type;chemokine receptor;chronic pain;inflammatory neuropathic pain;nerve injury;novel therapeutic intervention;nuclear factors of activated T-cells;patch clamp;prevent;receptor;response;spared nerve;transcription factor;transcription factor NF-AT c3;voltage","The Role of Ca-dependent Transcription Factor NFAT in Pain Control","Project NarrativePain management remains one of the most serious public health problems.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Human Genome; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Vaccine Related","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CD8 T cells are critical in controlling infection by intracellular pathogens including viruses and intracellular bacteria. The ability to develop and sustain memory CD8 T cells after infection or immunization constitutes the basis for protective vaccination against infectious disease or in cancer immunotherapy. Since the level of protection against infection depends on the quality and quantity of memory CD8 T cells at the time of pathogen exposure understanding the mechanisms that govern differentiation and maturation of the memory CD8 T cell pool are critical to our ability to design the most effective vaccines.  CD8 T cell-mediated immune responses consist of several distinct stages including activation of antigen-specific nave CD8 T cells clonal expansion of effector CD8 T cells and formation of memory CD8 T cells. A plethora of protein factors including transcriptional regulators have been found to regulate each step of the CD8 T cell response and high throughput transcriptomic analyses have revealed core gene signatures associated with nave effector and memory CD8 T cells. In spite of the tremendous progress several knowledge gaps remains: 1) The heightened protective capacity by memory compared with nave CD8 T cells cannot be solely explained by differences in transcriptomes. What are other molecular features that distinguish memory from nave T cells? 2) Both effector and memory T cells are heterogeneous. What the lineage relationship among these subsets and what are their defining molecular features? 3) Among the known regulatory factors what are their target genes and how are they regulated i.e. how their regulatory functions are coordinated during CD8 T cell responses?  We hypothesize that the epigenetic modifications of CD8 T cell genome govern the effector-memory lineage relation and further confer enhanced recall response to memory T cells. Our specific aim is to map the dynamic changes of the epigenomes during CD8 T cell responses. We will isolate nave T cells with pre- defined antigen specificity and activate them using a well-established viral and bacterial infection model to obtain antigen-specific effector and memory T cells. By high throughput sequencing we will map seven active and repressive histone marks in nave effector and memory CD8 T cell subsets. By integrative bioinformatics analyses we will define:  1) Epigenetic code that distinguishes memory from nave CD8 T cells;  2) Lineage relationship among subsets from effector and memory CD8 T cells;  3) Dynamic changes in enhancer organization and activity at each stage of CD8 T cell responses.","Accounting;Acute;Algorithms;Antigens;Bacteria;Bacterial Antigens;Bacterial Infections;Bioinformatics;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;ChIP-seq;Chromatin;Clonal Expansion;Clonality;Code;Communicable Diseases;Coupled;DNA Modification Process;Dimensions;Enhancers;Epigenetic Process;Exposure to;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Gene-Modified;Genes;Genome;Genomics;Goals;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Histones;Immune response;Immunity;Immunization;Infection;Infection Control;Infectious Agent;Joints;Knowledge;Listeria monocytogenes;Location;Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus;Maps;Memory;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular;Pathway interactions;Population;Positron-Emission Tomography;Process;Proteins;Regulator Genes;Resolution;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Staging;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Cell Activation;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte Subsets;Testing;Time;Transgenic Organisms;Vaccination;Vaccine Adjuvant;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Viral;Virus;Virus Diseases;base;cancer cell;cancer immunotherapy;cell mediated immune response;cell type;cytotoxic;design;epigenome;epigenomics;genetic signature;genome-wide;histone modification;imprint;improved;novel;pathogen;pathogen exposure;programs;promoter;public health relevance;response;self-renewal;tool;transcriptome;transcriptomics;tumor","Epigenomic landscape in naive effector and memory CD8 T cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD8 T cells are critical in controlling infection by intracellular pathogens including viruses and intracellular bacteria.

"Brain Disorders; Hydrocephalus; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neonatal hydrocephalus is a common developmental anomaly affecting the human nervous system with an estimated incidence of 1 to 3 per 1000 live births creating an estimated healthcare burden of 2 billion dollars annually. Hydrocephalus leads to the expansion of cerebral ventricles and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality with mortality rates as high as 35%. A significant portion of neonatal hydrocephalus is idiopathic in nature. The major goal of this proposal is the identification of molecular mechanisms underlying hydrocephalus for the purpose of developing novel medical treatments. This goal will be pursued by utilizing mouse models of human ciliopathies. Ciliopathies are a group of disorders that display overlapping phenotypes with a common etiology of cilia defects. Ciliopathy models have described that develop hydrocephalus as a result of altered ependymal cilia beat mechanics resulting in abnormal flow of CSF. In this proposal we challenge the notion that motile cilia defects are the sole cause of hydrocephalus in ciliopathy models with our centralhypothesis that abnormal development of specific neural progenitor cells during early development plays a major role in hydrocephalus. The central hypothesis and the specific aims of this proposal are based on strong preliminary data. In specific aim 1 we will build upon strongpreliminary data that show that abnormal development of specific neural progenitor cells lead to hydrocephalus in a specific mouse model of the human disorder Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS). We will determine the specific neuroprogenitor cells involved in hydrocephalus and determine the defective signaling pathways in the neuroprogenitor cells that contribute to hydrocephalus. In specific aim 2 we will determine whether similar mechanisms apply to other ciliopathy mouse models. In specific aim 3 we will investigate the potential for modifying the hydrocephalic phenotype in ciliopathy mouse models utilizing pharmaceuticals and genetic methods to manipulate signaling pathways identified in Aim 1 and Aim 2. Successful completion of the research outlined in this application will advance the understanding of cilia dysfunction and ciliarelated diseases in general especially the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.

The proposed Training Program Mechanisms of Health and Disease at the Behavioral- Biomedical Interface is designed to train predoctoral students to meet this challenge and to be the leaders and innovators of Behavioral and Biomedical science. In response to the NIGMS-sponsored initiative to train predoctoral students at the interface of Behavioral and Biomedical science we propose an innovative new Training Program focused on Behavioral-Biomedical interface training around three themes: Lifespan Brain Health Psychobiology of Chronic Disease and Women's Health and Disease. The overarching objective of our Program is to train the next generation of behavioral science researchers to utilize biomedical methodologies and conceptual frameworks that stretch the boundaries of their thinking and research to enable them to make transformative breakthroughs in understanding both health and behavior. Through a combination of coursework and laboratory experiences the program will provide predoctoral students with (1) Broad based training in the fundamentals of behavioral science including statistical methodology and experimental design and key issues in health psychology and behavioral medicine clinical psychology and neuroscience; (2) In-depth training in pathophysiology and specific biomedical research areas (including the conceptual framework driving hypotheses and laboratory techniques of those areas); and (3) guidance and mentoring for development and implementation of an innovative independent research program that spans both behavioral and biomedical science. The Training Program will be conducted by faculty from the Department of Psychology and the College of Medicine at the University of Iowa and will enable us to formalize and strengthen the training at the interface that already exists informally at Iowa. This program is highly relevant to public health because training at the behavioral-biomedical interface will enable these scientists to more effectively understand and innovatively address mechanisms of health and disease.","Behavioral;Disease;Health","Mechanisms of Health and Disease at the Behavioral-Biomedical Interface","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The interface of behavioral and biomedical sciences is one of the most vibrant frontiers of science today.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the development of hierarchical models and parallelized Bayesian inference for the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data.  Special emphasis is placed on gene expression profiling of parental inbred lines and their hybrid offspring for the discovery of key genes underlying heterosis the genetic phenomenon otherwise known as hybrid vigor.  The project will be led by a collaborative team of researchers with expertise in the analysis of high-dimensional gene expression data Bayesian inference bioinformatics biology computational methods genetics genomics and statistics.  The proposed research provides new tools for the analysis of high-dimension and low-sample-size count data generated by RNAseq technology.  Hierarchical modeling allows for flexible information sharing across dimensions to extract as much information as possible from data.  Parallel methods for Bayesian inference harness the power of modern computing to produce comprehensive results in a timely manner.  Specific methods will be developed for (i) the identification of genes that exhibit expression heterosis (ii) the detection of expressed and non-expressed genes and (iii) the discovery of differential allele usage in hybrids.  These methods will provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of heterosis and lead to the discovery of key genes whose expression patterns provide hybrids with advantages over their parents.  This information can be used to efficiently predict which of thousands of possible crosses will result in top performing hybrids. In addition to the specific methods mentioned above hierarchical generalized linear models for the simultaneous analysis of tens of thousands of response variables will be developed.  This work will permit the analysis of RNAseq data from complex designs with multiple sources of variability and will greatly extend the range of applicability for the funded research to encompass a variety of challenges in high-dimensional data analysis.","Alleles;Bayesian Analysis;Bioinformatics;Biology;Complex;Computing Methodologies;Data;Data Analyses;Detection;Development;Dimensions;Disease;Exhibits;Funding;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Phenomena;Genomics;Health;Hybrid Vigor;Hybrids;Inbreeding;Lead;Linear Models;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Parents;Pattern;Public Health;RNA Sequence Analysis;Research;Research Personnel;Sample Size;Source;Technology;Work;complex biological systems;design;flexibility;gene function;offspring;response;statistics;tool;transcriptome sequencing","Hierarchical Modeling and Parallelized Bayesian Inference for RNAseq Analysis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will provide medical researchers with advanced tools for studying the functions of genes in complex biological systems.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the second competitive renewal of a training program whose main goal is to promote the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in Pharmacological Sciences. Its secondary goal is to foster interactions among faculty and students from different departments and colleges at the University of Iowa that share an interest in Pharmacological Sciences. The program was initially funded in July 2004 for a period of three years and with three predoctoral slots to provide the initial resources necessary for further development of an interdisciplinary curriculum and training program that is at the core of the pharmacological sciences. As evidence of the interdisciplinary nature of this program our trainees come from six different departments (Chemistry Medicinal & Natural Products Chemistry [MNPC] Pharmacology Physiology Biochemistry Anatomy & Cell Biology) in three colleges (Liberal Arts and Sciences Pharmacy and Medicine). The recruitment of 19 trainees with strong-to-outstanding credentials from outside the Department of Pharmacology (of a total of 27) is tangible evidence that this TG functions as a highly effective mechanism to attract the interest and promote the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in the Pharmacological Sciences regardless of departmental affiliation. This TG has led to a significant increase in the teaching mentoring and research interactions among faculty and students in the two core departments Pharmacology in the Carver College of Medicine (CCOM) and Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry (MNPC) in the College of Pharmacy (COP) during the last funding period. Moreover with a pool of 51 excellent faculty trainers from across the University the program is strongly positioned to qualify for an additional five years of funding. A modest expansion of our TG from currently 6 to 8 slots is justified by 1) the quality and size of our applicant pool 2) the diversity of our trainee pool (15% URMs 41% women) and most importantly 3) the success of our graduates. An expansion of this TG will aid our ability to attract nationwide students with excellent credentials to the Pharmacological Sciences and foster interdepartmental and intercollegiate collaboration at the U of Iowa. The curriculum established for this TG provides both basic and advanced instruction in Pharmacological Sciences and has undergone continual review and revision to ensure that it fulfills the needs of the program and the students. The two 5-week 1 semester hour (sh) modules Principles in Pharmacology (71:135) and Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics (71:136) serve as a concise and highly effective introductory course sequence for all trainees of this TG. Modularized in 2010 from a 3 sh course this course sequence attracts a sizable number of graduate students (5-year average: 15 per year of which 2/3rd are from outside the Pharmacology Ph.D. program). These students come from various departments and Ph.D. programs including Pharmacology MNPC Molecular & Cell Biology Neuroscience Physiology & Biophysics Biochemistry Anatomy & Cell Biology and Chemistry. The increased enrollment reflects the successful reorganization of the course enhanced emphasis on ""modern"" (genetics and genomics) in addition to ""core"" (dynamics and kinetics) subdisciplines as well as enhanced interactions between trainers and trainees with common interests. We also host a unique course specifically for trainees of this program: Advanced Problem Solving in Pharmacological Sciences (71:250). Each month it features an in-depth lecture by a trainer on a research problem related to Pharmacological Sciences. Closely mentored by the trainer students then work as a group to solve a problem and write a substantial NIH style research proposal. Finally all trainees along with trainers attend the semi-weekly Pharmacology Seminar (71:204) which consists of research presentations by students in the graduate program in Pharmacology the trainees of this program as well as postdoctoral fellows and on- and off campus faculty.","Science;Training;pre-doctoral","Predoctoral Training in the Pharmacological Sciences","The Training Grant in Pharmacological Sciences has two main goals to promote the interdisciplinary training of graduate students in Pharmacological Sciences and to foster interactions among faculty and students from different departments and colleges at the University of Iowa that share an interest in Pharmacological Sciences.","NIGMS","9063066","5/26/2016","PA-10-036","4T32GM067795-13","4","T32","GM","067795","13","","KODURI, SAILAJA ","7/1/2004","6/30/2017","Biomedical Research and Research Training Review Subcommittee B[BRT-B]"," ","6870601","STRACK, STEFAN ","Not Applicable","01","NEUROSCIENCES","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," ","859","Training, Institutional","2016","231162"," ","NIGMS","230734","15611"," ","231162",
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Pediatric","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research program is to provide speech-language pathologists with information about how to best use physical context (e.g. the room or setting) to improve word-learning and generalization in children with primary language impairment (LI). The project will focus on how variations of training contexts affect two important components of word learning: learning the word-object link (i.e. being able to identify the correct object when its label is heard) and learning the word-form (i.e. being able to identiy the correct label when shown the target object). The specific aims of the proposed research are to determine: 1-The extent to which variability of training contexts affects children's memory for newly learned word-object links and their generalization of those links to untrained exemplars and contexts; 2- The extent to which variability of training contexts affects children's memory fornewly learned word-forms and their generalization of those word-forms to untrained exemplars and contexts; 3-The extent to which variability of training contexts during ecologically-valid interventions supports word learning and generalization among children with LI. Based on findings from past literature the central hypothesis is that training in variable contexts will promote the most learning advantages as it will enable superior generalization to untrained exemplars and untrained contexts. The research strategy involves 3 experiments in which children with and without LI will be taught new words for unfamiliar objects and then asked to remember the word-object links and word forms in trained and untrained contexts after a delay of several days. This study will provide valuable information about the role of context in children's retention of new word-referent mappings.","Achievement;Address;Adult;Affect;Attention;Categories;Child;Child Development;Child Language;Clinical;Cues;Development;Early Intervention;Educational process of instructing;Effectiveness;Environment;Fostering;Goals;Health;Hearing;Home environment;Immediate Recalls;Intervention;Label;Language;Language Development;Learning;Linguistics;Link;Literature;Location;Maps;Memory;Mentors;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Nursery Schools;Occupations;Oral;Outcome;Pathologist;Population;Qualifying;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Schools;Speech;Structure;Testing;Training;Variant;Vocabulary;Work;Writing;base;career;dosage;effective intervention;elementary school;executive function;improved;insight;knowledge base;language impairment;memory process;novel;processing speed;programs;research study;response;skills;teacher;word learning","Context Effects on Word Learning and Generalization","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will yield new insights about how physical context (e.g. the room or the setting) affects word learning and generalization in children with language impairment (LI).

"Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Pediatric","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormal differentiation of superficial epithelia (e.g. the oral epithelium epidermis) is an etiology shared among structural birth defects ranging from orofacial clefting to congenital ichthyosis. Linkage and association studies confirm that these genetic disorders have a genetic basis. However in the case of orofacial clefting only about half of the heritable risk has been assigned to specific genes. Moreover even in the case of ichthyosis for which the causative genes of most of the common forms have been discovered how the encoded proteins contribute to the differentiation of epidermis remains only poorly understood. Thus there remains a critical need to identify regulatory molecules that control the development of superficial epithelia and to determine the interactions among them. Without a thorough understanding of the overall gene regulatory network responsible for the development of superficial epithelia the efforts of genetic counselors wishing to predict risk for these disorders will continue to be severely limited. The zebrafish embryonic skin or periderm is a tractable model for superficial epithelia. Here we propose an in vivo systems biology approach to deduce the architecture of the transcriptional network governing differentiation of zebrafish periderm. We will do so in Aim 1 through extensive in vivo perturbation analyses including epistasis experiments. Further in Aim 2 with a combined approach using in vivo reporter studies and computational analyses we will identify cis-regulatory modules that control expression in the periderm. We will test the hypothesis that enhancers that are active at the same level within the network hierarchy will share a common organization. Our team includes an investigator with expertise in zebrafish embryology and one with expertise in genomic analysis of cis-regulatory modules in model systems. Successful completion of the proposed work will constitute the most exhaustive analysis of trans- and cis- acting elements driving differentiation of any vertebrate cell type conducted to date. Our expected outcome therefore is a dramatic advance in understanding the development of superficial epithelia resulting in an improved ability to recognize sequence polymorphisms in coding and regulatory DNA and that are pathogenic for diseases of epithelial differentiation which include disorders of skin and oro-facial clefting.","Advanced Development;Architecture;Automobile Driving;Beryllium;Biological Models;Cataloging;Catalogs;Code;Computer Analysis;Congenital Abnormality;Congenital ichthyosis;DNA;Defect;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Ectoderm;Elements;Embryo;Embryology;Enhancers;Epidermis;Epithelial;Epithelium;Etiology;Face;Gene Activation;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Epistasis;Genetic Polymorphism;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Health;Hereditary Disease;Human;Ichthyoses;Laboratories;Life;Measures;Mission;Modeling;Mutation;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research;Outcome;Patients;Periderm;Permeability;Process;Proteins;Publishing;Regulator Genes;Regulatory Element;Reporter;Reporting;Research Personnel;Risk;Skin;Staging;Structural Congenital Anomalies;Sum;Systems Biology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Van der Woude syndrome;Work;Zebrafish;base;cell type;cis acting element;cleft lip and palate;disorder risk;gene repression;genetic counselor;improved;in vivo;innovation;knock-down;network architecture;novel;novel diagnostics;oral cavity epithelium;orofacial cleft;overexpression;programs;research study;skin disorder;success;tool;transcription factor","Dissecting the transciptional network governing differentiation of periderm","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired differentiation of superficial epithelia which include epidermis and oral epithelium can cause structural birth defects including rare but life-threatening defects in epidermal permeability barrier and the common birth defect cleft lip and palate.

"Cancer; Precision Medicine; Uterine Cancer","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  While outcomes have substantially improved for many types of cancer endometrial cancer incidence and deaths are on the rise with the five year survival rate worse today than three decades ago. Inadequate sensitivity to chemotherapy is a primary cause of therapeutic failure. Our central hypothesis is that molecular inhibitors of key master regulators of cell cycle checkpoints chosen based upon the knowledge of the tumor phenotype synergize with chemotherapy and promote catastrophic tumor cell death. Our hypothesis is based on substantial preliminary data that sensitivity to chemotherapy depends upon the ability to enhance the number of cells in vulnerable periods of the cell cycle: taxanes are effective for cells in M and platinum-based compounds and anthracyclines work primarily in S. Mutations in TP53 KRAS PTEN genes encoding PI3Kinase and growth factor receptors such as FGFR2 predominate in endometrial cancer altering master regulators of cell cycle checkpoints in unique and predictable ways. The rationale for this study is that in order to address the alarming trend towards declining survival in endometrial cancer we must overcome the impact of these driving mutations by combining standard chemotherapy with appropriate molecular inhibitors which can enhance cell sensitivity a concept we term molecularly enhanced chemotherapy. We propose three specific aims to test and implement this strategy: 1. Determine the effect of mutations on checkpoint kinase activation associated with chemoresistance in specimens from the completed clinical trial GOG 177 using pretreatment preserved tissue. Validate signaling targets of cell cycle control which relate to response to chemotherapy from fresh frozen tissue in GOG 210. 2. Overcome mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy by manipulating cell cycle checkpoints with molecular inhibitors in cell models replicating endometrial tumor subtypes. 3. Optimize combinations of targeted agents with chemotherapy using human-in-mouse models. Thus the major emphasis of this proposal is on the rational development of novel therapeutic strategies for endometrial cancer that have a significant potential for early translation to the clinic. The findings from this comprehensive research plan will be rapidly deployed in future clinical trials.","Address;Anthracyclines;Automobile Driving;Cell Count;Cell Cycle;Cell Cycle Checkpoint;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell Death;Cell model;Cells;Cessation of life;Cisplatin;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Data;Development;Disease;Doxorubicin;ERBB2 gene;Endometrial Carcinoma;Endometrial Neoplasms;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;FGFR2 gene;FRAP1 gene;Failure;Formalin;Freezing;Funding;Future;Gefitinib;Goals;Grant;Growth Factor Receptors;Growth Inhibitors;Gynecologic Oncology Group;Health;Human;In Vitro;Incidence;KRAS2 gene;Knowledge;Laboratories;Leadership;Link;MAPK14 gene;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Maps;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Outcome;PTEN gene;Paclitaxel;Paraffin Embedding;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Phase III Clinical Trials;Phenotype;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Pilot Projects;Platinum;Positioning Attribute;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Randomized;Recurrent disease;Regimen;Research;Resistance;Role;Science;Signal Transduction;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Specimen;Survival Rate;TP53 gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Translations;Treatment Failure;Tumor Bank;Tumor Subtype;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors;Woman;Work;Xenograft Model;Xenograft procedure;actionable mutation;base;bench to bedside;bevacizumab;biomarker discovery;cancer cell;cancer clinical trial;cancer subtypes;cancer type;chemotherapy;design;expectation;improved;in vivo;infancy;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;lapatinib;mouse model;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutics;personalized medicine;phase III trial;phosphoproteomics;predict clinical outcome;predicting response;receptor;resistance mechanism;response;standard care;targeted agent;targeted treatment;taxane;tissue biomarkers;trend;tumor","Targeted Therapy for Endometrial Cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  While outcomes have substantially improved for many types of cancer endometrial cancer incidence and deaths are on the rise due in large part to inadequate sensitivity to chemotherapy.

"Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smoking is the leading preventable cause of mortality accounting for ~5 million deaths per year and up to 15% of healthcare expenditures worldwide. Chronic pain exacts a similarly high toll on individuals and society. In the U.S. chronic pain affects ~116 million persons and generates $635 billion in costs yearly. The interplay between chronic pain and smoking has been evident for decades - it appears that a positive feedback loop exists in which individuals smoke to relieve their pain smoking exacerbates the pain and individuals smoke more in response. Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship will provide insights into new behavioral or pharmacological therapeutic interventions. Little is known about CNS mechanisms that may contribute to the adverse relationship between smoking and chronic pain. We recently determined that activation of 42 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) by microinjection of the prototypic agonist epibatidine in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) a critical brainstem relay for bulbospinal pain modulation produces antinociception. However the efficacy of epibatidine is greatly diminished under conditions of persistent inflammatory pain produced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the hind paw. The mechanistic reason for this decrease is unknown. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanistic intersection of smoking (nicotine use) and chronic pain. Having established that persistent inflammatory nociception decreases the antinociceptive efficacy of epibatidine in the RVM SA 1 tests the ""mirror"" hypothesis that chronic exposure of the RVM to an 42 AChR agonist enhances the heat hyperalgesia induced by CFA. SA 2 tests the hypothesis that persistent inflammatory nociception decreases the number or affinity of 42 AChRs in the RVM determines whether this decrease is transcriptional or translational in nature and confirms that intra-RVM infusion o epibatidine produces the expected upregulation of 42 AChRs. SA 3 determines whether persistent inflammatory nociception decreases the presynaptic or postsynaptic actions of epibatidine in specific populations of spinally-projecting RVM neurons. This proposal is innovative in that it 1) examines the intersection of smoking and chronic pain at a mechanistic level and 2) focuses on the role of bulbospinal pain modulatory pathways as a contributing mechanism. The hypotheses and methods address my desire to develop as a pharmacologist and neuroscientist and will provide me multidisciplinary training in cutting-edge methods and quantitative approaches ranging from system to cellular levels. My professional development will be further augmented by the training environment provided by the University of Iowa Pain Research Program. I will gain valuable feedback through weekly interactions with broadly-trained investigators as well as presentation of my work to the local and larger scientific communities and to my thesis committee which includes 3 physician-scientists. As a whole this proposal outlines the investigation of a critical clinically-based question conducted in an outstanding environment and will facilitate my future success as a physician-scientist.","Accounting;Acute Pain;Address;Affect;Affinity;Agonist;Analgesics;Behavioral;Binding;Brain Stem;Cell Nucleus;Cells;Cessation of life;Chronic;Chronic inflammatory pain;Clinical;Communities;Conscious;Data;Development;Dose;Drug effect disorder;Electrophysiology (science);Environment;Expenditure;Exposure to;Feedback;Freund&apos;s Adjuvant;Future;General Population;Genes;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Heating;Hyperalgesia;Individual;Inflammatory;Infusion procedures;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intervention;Investigation;Iowa;Label;Link;Measurement;Methods;Microinjections;Modeling;Molecular Biology;Morbidity - disease rate;Nature;Neurons;Nicotine;Nicotinic Receptors;Nociception;Non-smoker;Pain;Pain Research;Pain management;Pathway interactions;Patients;Persistent pain;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physicians;Population;Prevalence;Property;Public Health;Rattus;Reporting;Role;Saline;Scientist;Smoke;Smoker;Smoking;Societies;Synaptic Transmission;System;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;Training;Universities;Up-Regulation;Virus;Withdrawal;Work;acetylcholine receptor agonist;base;behavioral pharmacology;chronic pain;clinically relevant;cost;epibatidine;inflammatory pain;innovation;insight;investigator training;midbrain central gray substance;mortality;multidisciplinary;neurochemistry;optogenetics;pain behavior;patch clamp;postsynaptic;pre-clinical;presynaptic;programs;radioligand;receptor;response;smoking prevalence;success","Mechanistic Bases for the Adverse Interaction of Nicotine and Chronic Pain","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Smoking and chronic pain are significant public health problems each exacting a huge toll on both individuals and society and their co-occurrence is not uncommon.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human; Transplantation","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of stem cell-based therapies is currently not being fully realized due to the lack of appropriate pre-clinical animal models. Consequently there remains a critical need to develop better animal models that better translate results from preclinical research trials to the patient. Scientific advancements addressing this problem have been realized through the identification of a naturally occurring Severe Combined Immuno- Deficient (SCID) line of pigs. The SCID pig model has been preliminarily characterized as both T and B lymphocytes deficient and thus is deficient in adaptive immunity. The pig is known to be an excellent model for human biology due to similarities in size physiology and genetic code; and this novel SCID model has been successfully engrafted with multiple human cancer cell lines indicating high potential as an in vivo model for many areas of regenerative medicine testing. We have received multiple requests and interest in obtaining this model. The research areas of these interested scientists spans many areas of regenerative medicine research from cardiac progenitor cell therapies to cartilage regeneration studies to the use of mesenchymal stem cells for bone regeneration and wound repair to improving treatment of graft versus host disease in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants. A pig SCID model will have a specific positive impact in that it will provide researchers with alternative and comparative models for such stem cell research. Our long-term goal is to create validated SCID models for broad use in preclinical testing of such stem cell based therapies. The specific objectives of this application are to further develop this model for regenerative medicine testing as well as improve its abilityto engraft human cells into the bone marrow so that a human immune system can develop. Such an advanced model could be broadly used for vaccine testing and the study of human-specific pathogens. To maximize the broad use of these models we will further develop protocols and design and test biocontainment facilities for practical utilization of our current pi lines. Our rationale for the proposed research is that the SCID pig is physiologically and phylogenetically more similar to humans than the mouse and therefore may more accurately reflect how proposed stem cells will survive and function in humans. This project is innovative because a SCID pig model has not been fully developed and development of such model may result in significantly and rapidly advancing the fundamental knowledge of SCID into translational medicine capable of accelerating regenerative medicine research. With regard to expected outcomes the successful completion of this project will create multiple genetic resources and associated animal procedures that will be highly desirable for SCID based modeling for research projects focused on the efficacy of stem cell therapeutics. Thus these unique resources are expected to have a significant impact in accelerating the translation of regenerative medicine research into the clinic.      ","Address;Age-Months;Alleles;Allogenic;Amino Acid Sequence;Animal Model;Animals;Area;B-Lymphocytes;Biology;Bone Marrow;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Bone Regeneration;Cancer cell line;Cardiac;Cell Therapy;Cells;Clinic;Counseling;Development;Engraftment;Family suidae;Gene Mutation;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Code;Goals;Graft-vs-Host Disease;Heart Research;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic stem cells;Heterozygote;Human;Human Biology;Immune;Immune system;Immunophenotyping;Inbreeding;Institutes;Knowledge;Letters;Life;Maintenance;Mesenchymal Stem Cells;Modeling;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases;Natural Killer Cells;Neonatal;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Patients;Peptide Sequence Determination;Phenotype;Physiology;Population Genetics;Pre-Clinical Model;Preclinical Testing;Preparation;Procedures;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Regenerative Medicine;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Residual state;Resources;Safety;Scientist;Splice-Site Mutation;Stem Cell Research;Stem cells;Study models;T-Lymphocyte;Terminator Codon;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Translations;Transplantation;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Work;Wound Healing;Xenograft procedure;adaptive immunity;artemis;base;biocontainment facility;cartilage regeneration;cohort;comparative;design;gene product;genetic resource;human stem cells;improved;in vivo Model;innovation;interest;leukemia/lymphoma;mouse model;mutant;novel;null mutation;pathogen;pre-clinical;pre-clinical research;public health relevance;stem cell therapy;translational medicine;vaccine evaluation","Expanding the Utility of Severe Combined Immuno-Deficient (SCID) Pig Models","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The promise of stem cell-based therapies is not currently being fully realized due to the lack of appropriate pre-clinical animal models.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acquired resistance and poor tumor response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is a significant challenge for effective treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore further identification and characterization of molecular mechanisms associated with HNSCC tumor response to EGFR inhibition could lead to improvements in drug efficacy and HNSCC patient survival. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) production has been shown to promote tumor progression and invasiveness in HNSCC. However little is known about the effect of EGFR inhibitors (EGFRIs) on IL-6 production. The candidate has observed a profound increase in toll-like receptor (TLR) and IL-6 signaling in HNSCC cells resistant to the EGFRI erlotinib compared to erlotinib-sensitive HNSCC cells. These observations led the candidate to the proposal that chronic EGFRI treatment may induce the production and secretion of IL-6 in HNSCC tumor cells via TLR activation leading to reduced drug efficacy tumor progression and acquired resistance to EGFRIs. Additionally prior work in our laboratory has found that EGFR pathway inhibition induced hydrogen peroxide production via activation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) which has been reported to increase IL-6 expression. Given these observations EGFRIs may stimulate pathways involving TLRs NOX4 and IL-6 leading to an inflammatory response in HNSCC tumor cells. The current proposal tests the hypothesis that the antitumor effects of EGFRIs are reduced in HNSCC via NOX4-mediated oxidative stress and TLR-mediated activation of IL-6 signaling in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1 will examine the role of NOX4-mediated oxidative stress in the mechanism of action of EGFRIs in HNSCC in vitro; Aim 2 will determine the contribution of TLR signaling in the mechanism of action of EGFRIs in HNSCC in vitro and in vivo; and Aim 3 will determine if IL-6 pathway blockade would enhance the efficacy of EGFRIs in HNSCC tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The candidate expects that the successful completion of this application will highlight the significance of TLR NOX4 and IL-6-mediated inflammation in EGFR-based chemotherapy and contribute in a meaningful way to a new biochemical rationale for the use of IL-6 pathway inhibitors in combination with EGFRIs for the treatment of HNSCC.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Biochemical;Cell Line;Chronic;Clinical;Data;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor;Erlotinib;Gene Expression;Genes;Growth;Head and Neck Cancer;Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;Immune response;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammation Mediators;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-6;Kinetics;Laboratories;Lead;Malignant Epithelial Cell;Measures;Mediating;Molecular;Morbidity - disease rate;NADPH Oxidase;Neoplasm Metastasis;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Predisposition;Production;Publishing;Receptor Activation;Receptor Inhibition;Receptor Signaling;Recurrence;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Sampling;Serum;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Protein;Staging;Survival Rate;Testing;Toll-like receptors;Transcription Factor AP-1;Tumor Promotion;Work;Xenograft procedure;angiogenesis;antitumor effect;base;cell killing;chemotherapy;cytotoxicity;drug efficacy;effective therapy;genetic manipulation;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;knock-down;migration;mouse model;neoplastic cell;overexpression;public health relevance;receptor expression;response;transcription factor;tumor;tumor progression","Role of inflammation in resistance to EGFR inhibitors in head and neck cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) is a significant challenge for the effective treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

"Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrests are a common and lethal problem accounting for approximately 160000 deaths every year in the United States. Previous efforts to improve cardiac arrest outcomes have largely focused on pre-arrest (e.g. rapid response teams) and intra-arrest factors (e.g. quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]); much less emphasis has been placed on post-arrest factors or post-resuscitation care. Yet nearly 50% of all deaths due to a cardiac arrest occur during the post-resuscitation phase and there is widespread belief that survival can be improved substantially. The importance of the post-resuscitation phase has been recently recognized by professional societies like the American Heart Association. However our understanding of the critical elements of post-resuscitation care that might improve patient outcomes remains severely limited; we do not understand precisely which therapies protocols and organizational factors are effective. The research proposed in this application has been designed to advance the science and knowledge regarding post- resuscitation care as well as support the continued development of Dr. Saket Girotra- an extremely promising cardiologist with interest and training in health services research.  Aim 1 will involve a systematic review of the existing literature to comprehensively synthesize all interventions (therapies processes of care organizational interventions) that have been studied for improving survival during the post-resuscitation phase. The available evidence will be systematically synthesized using both qualitative and quantitative (e.g. meta-analysis) methods.  Aim 2 will examine hospital-level variation in post-resuscitation survival using data from the Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation (GWTG-Resuscitation) registry. Using hierarchical models we will estimate risk- adjusted rates of post-resuscitation survival at each hospital. We will identify hospitals with exceptionally good survival rates (high-performing hospitals) using a deviance approach. This work will lay the foundation of our efforts to identify specific practices at high-performing hospitals that allow them to achieve superior outcomes.  Aim 3 will involve development and implementation of a survey of key informants at participating hospitals in GWTG-Resuscitation to obtain detailed information regarding hospital-specific post-resuscitation care practices. The survey will allow us to identify which specific strategies are used by high performing hospitals that allow them to achieve their exceptional outcomes. We hypothesize that these strategies will be multi- faceted and include specific treatments processes of care personnel as well as organizational factors (e.g. leadership communication). Identifying strategies that are most effective in improving post-resuscitation care (""best practices"") will inform on the design of a quality improvement intervention geared towards improving post -resuscitation care at all hospitals. This will be the subject of a future R01 by the applicant.","Accounting;Affect;Aftercare;Algorithms;American Heart Association;Attention;Beds;Belief;Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation;Caring;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Chest;Coma;Communication;Data;Development;Discipline of Nursing;Effectiveness;Elements;Foundations;Future;Guidelines;Health;Health Services Research;Heart;Heart Arrest;Hospitalization;Hospitals;Human Resources;Intensive Care Units;Intervention;Investigation;Knowledge;Leadership;Learning;Length of Stay;Literature;Meta-Analysis;Methods;Modeling;Myocardial;Nervous System Trauma;Neurologic;Outcome;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Performance;Phase;Process;Professional Organizations;Protocols documentation;Registries;Research;Research Project Grants;Resuscitation;Risk Estimate;Science;Structure;Sudden Death;Surveys;Survival Rate;Survivors;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Training;United States;Variant;Work;cost;design;disability;experience;improved;informant;innovation;insight;interest;natural hypothermia;percutaneous coronary intervention;response;survival outcome;systematic review","Post-Resuscitation Care and Survival After In-hospital Cardiac Arrest","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Sudden death due to the heart stopping (i.e. cardiac arrest) occurs commonly among hospitalized patients in the United States. Even after successful revival with CPR many cardiac arrest patients eventually die during the hospital stay. A patient's chance of surviving a cardiac arrest depends on the hospital in which they receive care. In other words some hospitals are better than others in saving lives. This research project will identify hospitals that offer the best chance of survival to a cardiac arrest patient who has been successfully revived with CPR and understand how these hospitals achieve their superior results. This knowledge will help us learn from the example of the 'best hospitals' and provide guidance on how to improve care so that all patients at all hospitals can be benefited.","NHLBI","9059770","5/2/2016","PA-11-193","5K08HL122527-03","5","K08","HL","122527","03","","COOPER, LAWTON S","5/1/2014","4/30/2019","ZHL1-CSR-K(F2)"," ","10863166","GIROTRA, SAKET ","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2016","4/30/2017"," ","837","Other Research-Related","2016","159862"," ","NHLBI","148020","11842"," ","159862",
"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Lung; Orphan Drug; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Animal models of human disease are critical for translational research aimed at dissecting disease mechanisms and for developing new therapies. The mouse has been invaluable in this effort but for many diseases this species fails to model the human phenotype. This is particularly evident in the cases of human lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency and primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). The basis for this species-specificity in disease susceptibility relates to both differencesin lung anatomy and cell biology and the genetic divergence of mice and humans. Recent advances in the field of animal modeling have placed the domestic ferret at the forefront of new genetically pliable species for modeling human diseases. First we have developed methods for generating knockout knock-in and transgenic ferrets that utilize somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Second the ferret genome was recently sequenced and is now publically accessible providing the information needed to interrogate the genetic suitability of the ferret to model a particular disease generate gene-targeting constructs and rapidly generate research tools for studies in this species. As proof of concept cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) knockout ferrets have been generated and found to model aspects of multi-organ disease (including spontaneous lung infections) seen in CF patients. Additionally transgenic ferrets that express fCFTR specifically in the gut (under the direction of the FABPi promoter) have been generated and shown to correct the meconium ileus phenotype in newborn CF ferrets. This R24 resource proposal seeks to create a Center that provides services for ferret disease modeling with a focus on the distribution of CF ferret resources and the creation of new ferret models of lung disease and of other diseases of NHLBI interest. Other focuses of this proposal will be to provide training in the use of ferrets for research provide services for alternative in vitro and ex vivo airway models and promote information exchange with the community through a web site that catalogs and distributes ""tool-box"" resources of general use for research in the ferret (antibodies cDNAs viral vectors primary airway cells improved genome annotation files for omics research). Strategic goals of this application will be to expand the number of ferret disease models available to the research community allow for broad and cost-effective usage of CF ferret models and build a self-sustaining business model for ongoing function of the Center past the five years of this proposal.","Affect;Age;Alternative Therapies;Anatomy;Animal Model;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antibodies;Birth;Blood;Boxing;Bronchiectasis;Businesses;Cataloging;Catalogs;Caucasians;Cell Therapy;Cells;Cellular biology;Chromosomes;Chronic;Communities;Complementary DNA;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Databases;Deposition;Disease;Disease Progression;Disease model;Disease susceptibility;Effectiveness;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Ferrets;Functional disorder;Funding;Gene Proteins;Gene Targeting;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Drift;Genetic Engineering;Genetic Models;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Health;Heart Diseases;Home environment;Human;Ileus;Immunoprecipitation;In Vitro;Infection;Information Distribution;Inherited;Institution;Iowa;Knock-in;Knock-out;Laboratories;Lead;Lung;Lung diseases;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Meconium;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibody R24;Mus;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;Neonatal;Newborn Infant;Organ;Other Genetics;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Patients;Peer Review;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Pliability;Preparation;Primary Ciliary Dyskinesias;Process;Proteins;Proteomics;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary Emphysema;Reagent;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Respiratory Tract Infections;Sampling;Services;Source;Species Specificity;Specimen;Staging;Stem cells;Technology;Testing;Tissue Model;Tissue Sample;Tissues;Training;Transgenic Organisms;Translational Research;Universities;VX-770;Viral Vector;Western Blotting;Withdrawal;Work;Xenograft procedure;abstracting;alpha 1-Antitrypsin;alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency;base;clinical care;cost;cost effective;cystic fibrosis patients;gene therapy;genome annotation;human disease;improved;information gathering;interest;meetings;model building;mouse model;mutant;novel therapeutics;pregnant;promoter;recombinant virus;repository;research study;sample collection;somatic cell nuclear transfer;therapy development;tool;web site","National Ferret Resource and Research Center on Lung Disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cystic fibrosis (CF) and alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency are among the most common inherited recessive disorders in Caucasians affecting ~1 in every 1600-3500 births each year.

"Bioengineering; Lung; Networking and Information Technology R&D; Smoking and Health; Tobacco","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mouse is the most commonly used animal model for toxicology risk assessments and tobacco smoke exposure. Because it is not possible to study every substance exposure or varying exposure conditions mathematical models and computer simulations are employed to the gap or to extend the range of experimental data. However computational toxicology is limited in its application to mouse inhalation exposure studies because of the lack of high-resolution accurate airway geometries needed for modeling and site-specific particle deposition data. By combining the unique imaging capabilities of the Imaging Cryomicrotome at the University of Washington with the expertise in highly-automated airway segmentation algorithms from the University of Iowa we will develop the methods and provide high-resolution 3D geometries of the four most commonly studied mice strains along with site-specific airway particle dosimetry in the same animals. The high-resolution datasets will be shared through an open access repository and used by other investigators to accelerate investigation of health and diseases related to the respiratory system. This will in turn improve our understanding of site-specific airflows and how they affect drug environmental or biological aerosol deposition in health and diseases related to occupational exposures air pollution and tobacco smoke.","Aerosols;Affect;Air;Air Pollution;Algorithms;Anatomy;Animal Model;Animals;Asthma;Biological;Biology;Breathing;Chemicals;Computational Biology;Computer Simulation;Data;Data Set;Deposition;Disease;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Dust;Engineering;Exposure to;Gases;Gender;Geometry;Health;Human;Image;Inhalation Exposure;Investigation;Iowa;Liver;Lung;Lung diseases;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Mouse Strains;Mus;Occupational;Occupational Exposure;Particle Size;Particulate;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Process;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary Emphysema;Rattus;Research;Research Personnel;Resolution;Respiratory System;Risk Assessment;Site;Smoke;Source;Structure-Activity Relationship;Surface;Systemic disease;Tobacco smoke;Toxicology;Tweens;Universities;Washington;Work;base;dosimetry;human subject;imaging modality;improved;indexing;insight;mathematical model;mouse model;particle;programs;repository;respiratory;spectrograph;three-dimensional modeling;tool;uptake","Anatomically derived airway models to facilitate computational toxicology in mice","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Completion of the proposed work will facilitate the use of computational biology with mouse models of respiratory exposures to air pollution occupational dusts and tobacco smoke.

"Biotechnology; Cancer","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program will the investigate use of pharmacologic ascorbate (high-dose i.v. delivery of vitamin C) in the treatment of cancer. Pharmacological ascorbate (AscH-) takes advantage of the basic chemical properties of AscH- to use it as a drug; in fact because of its properties as a reducing agent pharmacologic AscH- is a pro-drug for the delivery of extracellular H2O2 to tumor cells. In this use of AscH- it must be given intravenously; plasma levels of 20 - 30 mM are achieved; healthy individuals have plasma ascorbate levels on the order of 50 M (0.05 mM). With pharmacological AscH- the goal is to achieve a transient level of ascorbate in plasma on the order of 300-500 times that of typical healthy ""nutritional"" levels. The half-life of AscH- in plasma at these high levels is H2.3 h. Thus for 12 - 24 h after treatment levels of AscH- in plasma greatly exceed healthy ""nutritional"" levels. We propose to investigate the mechanism of action of pharmacological AscH- to learn: (1) what biochemical properties make cancer cells susceptible to pharmacological AscH-; and (2) why it is not toxic to normal tissue. Our goal is to unravel basic biochemical mechanisms so this therapy can be employed in a broad range of appropriately selected cancers.  We hypothesize that the difference in susceptibility of cells to pharmacological AscH- is the ability o maintain their intracellular redox buffer (GSSG2H+/2GSH) at a half-cell reduction potential (Ehc) compatible with life. The rationale for this hypothesis is that: (1) AscH- readily autoxidize producing a flux of H2O2 (in cell culture media and in vivo); (2) the high levels of extra cellularAscH- achieved by i.v. delivery (H300-500X ""nutritional"" levels) produce a high flux of H2O2; (3) the removal of this high flux of H2O2 by cells results in a great demand for intracellular reducingequivalents i.e. glutathione (GSH) and NADPH; (4) this results in oxidation of the intracellular redox buffer leading to quiescence or cell death depending on the extent of oxidation. Cells that maintain an appropriately reduced intracellular redox buffer will be less susceptible to exposure to pharmacological AscH-; cells that cannot maintain their intracellular redox buffer will die.  Because the status of the redox buffer is maintained by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) we further propose that an oxidatively challenged redox buffer will be synergistic with agents that also connect to the PPP e.g. gemcitabine 5-fluorouricil and especially ionizing radiation.  This research program supports translational efforts by addressing the fundamental question of why pharmacological ascorbate is non-toxic to organisms i.e. people yet cancer cells can be very susceptible.

"Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Heart Disease; Hypertension; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes a program of research training to enhance the applicant's skills that will permit an independent career in investigation of neuro-immuno mechanisms in cardiovascular disease at the molecular and cellular level. The research support component will investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms of neuro-immunune interaction in the development and maintenance of essential hypertension. By the year 2025 the incidence of essential hypertension is estimated to reach 1.56 billion adults worldwide. Essential hypertension is a leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease thus presenting an enormous public health concern. Hypertension is the consequence of multiple vascular neural and renal mechanisms. An under- lying aspect of the various mechanisms has been known to involve inflammation. However the relationship of inflammation to the various other known mechanisms of hypertension remains unknown. Emerging data suggests a role for provocation and suppression of innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses by the autonomic nervous system and its neurotransmitters. Preliminary results indicate that the cholinergic influence of the innate inflammatory response in hypertension is abnormally pro-inflammatory and that a CD161a+ innate immune cell population is abnormally present in a genetic model of essential hypertension. Innate immune cell populations that potentially play a role in the inflammatory mechanisms may underlie the development and maintenance of hypertension. Aim #1 will define the immune response of CD161a+ innate immune cells and its modulation by nicotinic cholinergic (nAChR) and angiotensin type I (AT1R) receptor activation. Aim #2 will determine the role of nicotinic cholinergic (nAChR) and angiotensin type 1 (AT1R) receptor modulation of SHR derived immune cell populations in the development of hypertension in vivo. Together these aims will elucidate the relationship between the nervous and immune systems in the development of hypertension end-organ damage and set the stage for future dissection of the signaling mechanisms involved in this interaction. Establishing definitive mechanisms and identifying specific immune cells will potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of medically refractory essential hypertension targeting novel molecular targets. The scientific program in concert with the career development plan will provide the opportunity to acquire additional skillsneeded for an independent career as a successful physician-scientist.","Accounting;Adrenergic Receptor;Adult;Age;Angiotensin Receptor;Angiotensins;Autonomic nervous system;Basic Science;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cells;Cellular biology;Cholinergic Receptors;Complement;Data;Development;Development Plans;Dissection;Dysautonomias;Essential Hypertension;Future;Genetic Models;Health;Heart failure;Hematopoietic;Hypertension;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunology;In Vitro;Inbred SHR Rats;Inbred WKY Rats;Incidence;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-6;Investigation;Iowa;Kidney;Knowledge;Lead;Ligands;Maintenance;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Molecular;Molecular Target;Molecular and Cellular Biology;Nervous system structure;Neurotransmitters;Nicotine;Nicotinic Receptors;Organ;Physicians;Play;Population;Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Publishing;Receptor Activation;Receptor Angiotensin Type 1;Refractory;Research Personnel;Research Support;Research Training;Resources;Role;Scientist;Signal Transduction;Source;Splenocyte;Staging;Techniques;Therapeutic Agents;Training;Translational Research;Universities;alpha-bungarotoxin receptor;cardiovascular risk factor;career;career development;cellular targeting;cholinergic;cytokine;design;hypertensive heart disease;immunoregulation;in vivo;kidney vascular structure;mortality;novel;novel therapeutics;programs;receptor;relating to nervous system;response;skills","The Neuro-Immuno Axis in a Genetic Model of Hypertension","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Essential hypertension is a leading cause of mortality and cardiovascular disease thus presenting an enormous public health concern.

"Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Cystic Fibrosis; Lung; Rare Diseases","Abstract/Summary (Administrative Core; Core 1) The Administrative Core provides oversight of the Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis under the supervision of the Center Executive Committee and External Advisors. One major area of responsibility is largely administrative including financial documentation and accountability for the Center's Pilot and Feasibility Program and its Cores and oversight and documentation of external review of the Center overall. Three major governing bodies contribute to the review of various Center functions. The Pilot and Feasibility Committee oversees decisions regarding pilot funding in conjunction with a Cystic Fibrosis Research and Development Program pilot program and an Institute for Clinical and Translational Science pilot program with each pilot receiving two external reviews before a decision is made. The Executive Committee is the major decision- making body of the Center and makes final judgments about the funding of new pilots and the renewal of ongoing pilots for a second year of funding. The External Advisory Committee provides direction to the Executive Committee as does the College of Medicine leadership. A second major responsibility of this Core is to enrich CF-related scientific programs and it does so through sustained membership and pilot recruitment efforts scientific enrichment programs (seminar series Center retreats and less formal scientific working- group meetings) and assessment of the Center's Research Cores and their services (e.g. through investigator questionnaires and external review). Lastly the Administrative Core acts as a conduit for research and services to both investigators outside the University of Iowa and the lay community (e.g. by maintaining the Center web site). In summary the Administrative Core assists its members in making breakthroughs in CF research and molecular therapies by: 1) recruiting talented junior investigators into careers in CF research and mentoring them through its pilot program and center activities; 2) assisting the Research Cores in providing efficient high quality and cost-effective services; and 3) providing forums for the exchange of new information and ideas among its members through its Enrichment Programs.","Accountability;Achievement;Administrator;Advisory Committees;Area;Budgets;Clinical Sciences;Communities;Cystic Fibrosis;Databases;Decision Making;Documentation;Ensure;Evaluation;Funding;Goals;Grant;Group Meetings;Institutes;Iowa;Journals;Judgment;Leadership;Lung;Maintenance;Manuscripts;Medicine;Mentors;Molecular;Monitor;Postdoctoral Fellow;Questionnaires;Records;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Secure;Series;Services;Summary Reports;Supervision;System;Translational Research;Universities;Visit;abstracting;base;career;college;cost effective;gene therapy;graduate student;member;programs;research and development;web interface;web site;working group","Pilot and Feasibility","n/a","NIDDK","9057516","3/29/2016","RFA-DK-13-007","5P30DK054759-17","5","P30","DK","054759","17","",""," "," ","ZDK1-GRB-7","7721","1876393","ENGELHARDT, JOHN F","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","213907"," ","141725","72182"," "," ",

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is a renewal of a previous P30 entitled ""Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis and Other Genetic Diseases."" As this name implies over the past 15 years the Center's focus and membership were very broad. For this renewal the focus has been narrowed to cystic fibrosis (CF). The development of effective gene therapies for CF requires a concrete understanding of disease pathogenesis relevant cellular targets for gene manipulation and technologies capable of effectively delivering the CFTR gene in vivo. The creation of new CF pig and ferret models had led to rapid expansion of CF research over the past 5-year funding period. Thus while the CF lung remains a major focus of the Center's research other areas such as cystic fibrosis- related diabetes (CFRD) and gene delivery to the pancreas have grown significantly. For example CFRD research at Iowa now includes the first clinical trial to study oral glucose tolerance in children 3 months to 5 years o age with the goal of studying early insular and enteroinsular hormonal abnormalities associated with early pathogenesis of CFRD in CF ferret and pig models. The Center has productively fostered CF research through the following mechanisms. 1) The Center's Pilot and Feasibility Program which has sponsored 59 pilots over the previous 15 years of funding has brought numerous new Members and expertise into the Center and fostered the maturation of talented junior Associate Members to independent tenure-track faculty. 2) The establishment or expansion of several core facilities (Vector Core Cell and Tissue Core Comparative Pathology Core Animal Models Core and Clinical Core) devoted to CF research has provided Center investigators with specialized vectors CF model systems (human pig ferret and mouse) and approaches that are testing important hypotheses about CF pathogenesis and developing effective therapies. These resources have also enabled the Center to serve as a resource for the distribution of viral vectors and CF pig and ferret resources to numerous outside institutions.3) Establishment of the CF ferret and pig models (just being developed at the time of the last renewal) that develop lung pancreatic gallbladder and intestinal abnormalities like those observed in CF patients has greatly facilitated research by Center Members. 4) Successful maintenance of a CF Lung Tissue Acquisition Consortium of lung transplant centers has provided the well-needed airway tissue required for humanized CF model systems. 5) The Center's Enrichment Programs (consisting of a centralized website a trainee seminar series an external speaker seminar series smaller informal research focus groups and Gene Therapy Center retreats) have fostered interdisciplinary interactions and training. 6) Establishment of formal internal and external mechanisms for review of the Center the Cores and the Pilot and Feasibility projects has ensured a high level of excellence and the most appropriate utilization ofthe Center's resources. In summary the Center has greatly strengthened existing CF research programs at the University of Iowa while also serving as a resource for other institutions that perform gene therapy and CF research. Its effectiveness is evident from the numerous basic and applied research findings that are enhancing our understanding of CF pathogenesis and the development of new therapies.","Age;Animal Model;Applied Research;Area;Basic Science;Biological Models;Cells;Child;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Comorbidity;Comparative Pathology;Core Facility;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Dependovirus;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Effectiveness;Ensure;Environment;Equine Infectious Anemia Virus;Faculty;Family suidae;Feline Leukemia Virus;Ferrets;Fertilization;Focus Groups;Fostering;Functional disorder;Funding;Gallbladder;Gastrointestinal Diseases;Gene Delivery;Genes;Goals;Growth;Health;Hereditary Disease;Histologic;Hormonal;Human;In Vitro;Innovative Therapy;Institution;Intestines;Iowa;Laboratories;Lung;Lung Transplantation;Lung diseases;Maintenance;Mentors;Mission;Modeling;Molecular;Movement;Mus;Names;Other Genetics;Outcome;Pancreas;Pathogenesis;Peer Review;Phenotype;Postdoctoral Fellow;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Quality of life;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Science;Series;Specimen;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic Studies;Time;Tissues;Training;Translational Research;Universities;Viral Vector;Vision;airway epithelium;career;cellular targeting;cystic fibrosis mouse;cystic fibrosis patients;disease phenotype;effective therapy;gene therapy;graduate student;improved;in vivo;innovation;member;multidisciplinary;new growth;novel;novel therapeutics;oral glucose tolerance;programs;ranpirnase;recombinant viral vector;research and development;tenure track;vector;web site","Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) seeks to improve the quality of life for CF patients by both enhancing the field's understanding of CF pathogenesis and developing molecular therapies.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Mental Health; Substance Abuse; Violence Against Women; Violence Research","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Male-initiated sexual aggression toward female acquaintances is a major public-health problem in adolescence and early adulthood. The efficacy of existing prevention programs has been disappointing necessitating the conduct of innovative basic science research that will lay the foundation for the development of novel prevention strategies. Risk of sexual aggression between acquaintances is associated both theoretically and empirically with alcohol use and with misperception of women's sexual-interest cues. Research also demonstrates that alcohol consumption decreases men's sensitivity to women's sexual interest but the mechanisms underlying this effect are unknown. The current project draws upon methods from cognitive and vision science to evaluate the role of overt visual attention (i.e. moment-by-moment eye movements) in men's perception of women's sexual-interest cues and to examine the influence of alcohol consumption on men's attention and decision-making when judging sexual interest. The goals are to determine (1) whether men's visual attention to women's faces women's bodies and the background context account for men's use of dating-relevant cues when judging women's sexual interest; (2) whether moderate alcohol consumption influences visual attention and use of dating-relevant cues; and (3) whether visual attention accounts for the association between alcohol consumption and use of dating-relevant cues. Eighty 21-25 year old participants will complete alcohol and no-alcohol sessions in a counterbalanced order. While their eye movements are monitored participants will view 200 unique scenes that depict a woman who varies along sexual interest provocativeness-of-dress and attractiveness dimensions in a background context that varies in sexual relevance. Participants will judge the woman's sexual interest after viewing each scene. In a third session participants will complete assessments of drinking patterns alcohol expectancies rape supportive attitudes insensitivity to women's rejection cues in a simulated rape and past historyof sexual aggression. Multilevel modeling will be used to evaluate the hypothesized links between alcohol condition visual attention and men's use of dating-relevant cues. The explicit translational goal of the project is to leverage theories and methods from basic cognitive and vision science to advance understanding of the effect of alcohol consumption on men's perceptions of women. The present project will lay the groundwork for the future development of cognitive-training strategies that target the precise visual-attention patterns generating individul differences in sexual- interest judgments and consumption-related reductions in men's sensitivity.","Accounting;Acquaintances;Adolescence;Affective;Aggressive behavior;Alcohol consumption;Alcohols;Attention;Attitude;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavior Control;Cognitive Science;Consumption;Cues;Decision Making;Development;Diagnostic;Dimensions;Dose;Educational Intervention;Eye;Eye Movements;Face;Feedback;Female;Forcible intercourse;Foundations;Future;Goals;Health;Heart;Heavy Drinking;Image;Individual Differences;Judgment;Knowledge;Length;Link;Literature;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mental Health;Methods;Mission;Monitor;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;Participant;Pattern;Perception;Personality;Play;Population;Prevention program;Prevention strategy;Process;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research;Risk;Role;Shapes;Speed;Sterile coverings;Testing;Theoretical model;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Variant;Visual attention;Woman;Work;aged;alcohol effect;alcohol expectancy;behavior measurement;cognitive training;college;drinking;emerging adult;experience;gaze;innovation;interest;male;men;multilevel analysis;novel;operation;peer;physical conditioning;remediation;sample fixation;selective attention;sexual coercion;theories;vision science;visual information","Alcohol Effects on Men's Visual Attention and Sensitivity to Sexual Interest Cues","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As documented in the proposal sexual aggression and alcohol use are closely linked and important public health issues with enduring physical and mental health consequences for victims.

"Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adequate perfusion is essential for normal brain function and impaired regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) may contribute to neurological dysfunction and disease. Despite recent progress our knowledge of mechanisms that regulate CBF remains inadequate. Two of the most powerful stimuli that affect CBF are hypercapnia and increased cellular activity (cellular metabolism and synaptic activity). Both of these stimuli increase local concentrations of hydrogen ion (reduce extracellular pH). The overall goal of this application is to examine the role of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in control of CBF. We found recently that ASICs are required for acid-evoked effects on synaptic plasticity. Moreover the ASIC1a subtype functions as a chemosensor in neurons mediating hypercapnia- and acid-evoked behaviors. These findings led to preliminary experiments testing whether ASICs also play a role in regulation of CBF. Although effects of hypercapnia and acidosis have been known for decades mechanisms that initiate vascular responses to these stimuli remain undefined. Based on this background we propose two Aims. Aim 1 will examine the hypothesis that ASICs mediate vascular responses to hypercapnia. We will examine vascular effects of hypercapnia and acidosis following manipulation of ASICs using genetic and pharmacological approaches. To define the importance of neuronal ASIC we will take advantage of mice lacking or overexpressing ASIC1a specifically in neurons. We will also use ASIC inhibitors to pharmacologically probe ASIC function. Aim 2 will use similar approaches to examine the hypothesis that neuronal ASICs contribute to vascular responses in models of neurovascular coupling. In pilot studies we found that disrupting ASIC1a nearly eliminated hypercapnia-induced vasodilation but also significantly attenuated vasodilator responses in a model of neurovascular coupling. Together these studies will unambiguously determine the importance and site of ASIC action in hypercapnia- and proton-dependent regulation of cerebrovascular responses. The studies may provide new and unprecedented insight into the complex interaction between brain and its vascular supply. Such insight may ultimately lead to improved therapeutic approaches for cerebrovascular disease and brain injury. This project was conceived and will be carried out by an innovative collaboration between investigators with diverse expertise in CBF neurovascular coupling pH regulation and ASICs.","ASIC channel;Acidosis;Acids;Affect;Aging;Amygdaloid structure;Attenuated;Behavior;Bicarbonates;Blood Vessels;Blood flow;Brain;Brain Injuries;Caliber;Carbon Dioxide;Cell Death;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Collaborations;Complex;Dementia;Development;Disease;Ensure;Excision;Functional disorder;Genetic;Glucose;Glutamate Receptor;Goals;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Hypercapnia;Hyperemia;Hypocapnia;Impaired cognition;Impairment;Intracranial Pressure;Knowledge;Lead;Measures;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;N-Methylaspartate;Neuroglia;Neurologic Dysfunctions;Neurons;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I;Nutrient;Perfusion;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Play;Production;Protons;Regulation;Research Personnel;Resistance;Rest;Role;Site;Stimulus;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;Therapeutic;Vascular blood supply;Vascular resistance;Vasodilation;Vasodilator Agents;Work;base;brain dysfunction;carbonate dehydratase;cardiovascular risk factor;cerebral microvasculature;cerebrovascular;extracellular;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;nervous system disorder;neurovascular coupling;novel strategies;overexpression;research study;response;sensor;somatosensory;tool","Regulation of Cerebral Blood Flow by Acid-Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs)","Optimal regulation of cerebral blood flow is critical for brain function.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroinflammation is now recognized as a key degenerative mechanism in several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). The severity of neuronal damage caused by neuroinflammatory stress is dependent on the degree of dysregulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory pathways in brain. Most studies to date are focused on identifying major pro-inflammatory pathways that are activated during neuroinflammatory insult. Understanding the anti-inflammatory mechanisms associated with various stages of brain inflammation will provide new insights into disease processes associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal we aim to delineate a novel anti-inflammatory protective response in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons mediated by the recently discovered mammalian protein homolog of mamba snake venom: Prokineticin-2 (PK2). Unexpectedly we observed a dramatic up-regulation of PK2 protein and its release from dopaminergic neuronal cells during inflammatory TNF insult. Further observation of increased PK2 expression in nigral dopaminergic neurons in an animal model of PD as well as in the nigral samples from postmortem PD patients provides credence for the clinical significance of our findings. Interestingly recombinant PK2 significantly protected against apoptotic neuronal cell death and TH positive dopaminergic neuronal loss induced by neuroinflammatory insults. Surprisingly PK2 treatment also promoted migration of both astrocytes and microglial cells. Therefore in this proposal we intend to expand our preliminary observations by pursuing the following specific aims: (i) To characterize the PK2 induction release and function in dopaminergic neurons following inflammatory insults in primary cell culture and animal models (ii) To determine the effect of PK2 induction on astroglial and microglial migration and function following inflammatory stimuli (iii) To investigate the molecular mechanisms of PK2 up-regulation in neuronal cells and (iv) To demonstrate the neuroprotective effect of PK2 in primary cell culture and animal models of PD. Cellular molecular and neurochemical approaches will be used to delineate these specific aims. Together understanding the role of PK2 up-regulation and release during inflammatory stress in dopaminergic neurons will not only provide new insights about neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying nigral dopaminergic degeneration but may also yield novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of Parkinson's disease.","1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium;Address;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Apoptotic;Astrocytes;Autopsy;Biological Assay;Brain;Brain region;CASP3 gene;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Coculture Techniques;DNA Fragmentation;Data;Dendroaspis;Disease;Encephalitis;Gene Expression;Goals;Homologous Protein;Inflammatory;Measures;Mediating;Microglia;Midbrain structure;Migration Assay;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuroglia;Neurons;PROKR1 gene;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Physiological;Primary Cell Cultures;Process;Proteins;Recombinants;Reporter;Research;Role;Sampling;Severities;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Small Interfering RNA;Snake Venoms;Staging;Stimulus;Stress;System;TNF gene;Tissues;Transduction Gene;Transgenic Mice;Up-Regulation;Viral;Wound Healing;chemokine;clinically relevant;clinically significant;cytokine;dopaminergic neuron;hypoxia inducible factor 1;in vivo;insight;knock-down;knockout animal;migration;neurochemistry;neuroinflammation;neuron loss;neurotoxic;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;overexpression;promoter;receptor;release factor;response;treatment strategy","Prokineticin 2 and Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms","Brain inflammation is emerging as a central mechanism underlying the progression of many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease.

"Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The molecular targets for photoreceptor degenerations and uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood. A major barrier to progress has been the lack of any specific molecular cause. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery of calcium-activated CAPN5 (calpain-5) as the cause of Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV). CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene and makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach for mechanism-based therapies for inflammation induced by photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptors express CAPN5 and an hCAPN5- R243L gain of function mutation in mice shows all the phenotypes of human ADNIV disease. The retina photoreceptors might be particularly sensitive to mutations in CAPN5 because high intracellular calcium is necessary and sufficient to regulate dark adaptation in photoreceptors. Our long-term goals are to find better and more specific treatments for photoreceptor degeneration. Our objective is to use our new hCAPN5-R243L mice to determine whether blocking CAPN5 activity can inhibit degeneration and uveitis. Our central hypothesis is that a calcium-activated CAPN5 pathway leads to ADNIV retinal degeneration and uveitis and our transgenic CAPN5 mutant mouse is the best available animal model for testing several new uveitis therapies. Our specific aims are to (1) Treat photoreceptor degeneration in hCAPN5-R243L mice with a pharmacological CAPN5 inhibitor (2) Rescue the photoreceptor phenotype in hCAPN5-R243L mice with a novel bipartite shRNA gene silencing vector and (3) Treat uveitis in hCAPN5-R243L mice using commercially available neutralizing antibodies targeting IL-6 and IL-23. Impact. We expect to establish the hCAPN5-R243L mouse as a valuable animal model for testing novel therapies in ADNIV which can be translated to patients. Our work should help determine the role of of calcium-activated CAPN5 signaling in ADNIV and other photoreceptor degenerations. Since hCAPN5-R243L disease stages phenocopy other eye diseases with photoreceptor degeneration and components of the CAPN5 pathway are found in other forms of uveitis our studies could have a broad positive impact beyond ADNIV and uveitis patients where components of the CAPN5 pathway may be therapeutic targets.","Affect;Alleles;Animal Model;Anterior;Antibodies;Biological Availability;Blindness;Calcium;Calpain;Catalytic Domain;Cells;Dark Adaptation;Disease;Disease Pathway;Disease model;Extravasation;Eye;Eye diseases;Gene Silencing;Genes;Goals;Hand;Human;Immune response;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inherited;Interleukin-6;Iris;Link;Membrane;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Target;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Natural immunosuppression;Necrosis;Nerve Degeneration;Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man;Oral;Pathway interactions;Patients;Penetration;Peptide Hydrolases;Phenocopy;Phenotype;Photoreceptors;Phototransduction;Posterior Uveitis;Proteins;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Degeneration;Retinal Diseases;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Staging;Steroids;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic antibodies;Transgenes;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Translating;Uveitis;Visual;Work;anterior chamber;base;blind;cytokine;disease phenotype;disease-causing mutation;exome sequencing;feeding;gain of function;gain of function mutation;gene therapy;genetic approach;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;interleukin-23;kindred;mouse model;mutant;neovascular;neutralizing antibody;novel;novel therapeutics;photoreceptor degeneration;public health relevance;small hairpin RNA;small molecule;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;vector","Mechanism-based therapies for photoreceptor degeneration","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  ADNIV is an inherited eye disease caused by mutations in CAPN5 that cause photoreceptor degeneration and uveitis.

"Biodefense; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases","Project Summary: Bacterial microcompartments are large subcellular structures composed ofmetabolic enzymes encapsulated within a protein shell built from multiple subunits. They arewidespread among bacteria functionally diverse linked to pathogenesis have a number ofimportant potential biomedical applications and appear to incorporate unique mechanistic andstructural principles. Their function is to sequester and regulate the production of toxic or volatileintermediates found in certain metabolic pathways. However little is known about how this isoccurs at the mechanistic level. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to elucidate themolecular principles and to build up a 3-dimensional structure of the microcompartmentsinvolved in 12-propanediol degradation by Salmonella. The Salmonella system is unmatchedwith regard to the knowledge and tools available for mechanistic studies of microcompartments.The proposed studies combine genetic biophysical and structural methods to elucidate thecellular function of the Salmonella Pdu microcompartment at a mechanistic level. Three specificaims are proposed: 1. Determine the role of terminal helixes and other mechanisms for targetingproteins to the lumen of the Pdu microcompartment; 2. Determine the role of pores and cofactorrecycling in supplying the lumen enzymes of the Pdu microcompartment with requiredsubstrates and cofactors; and 3. Elucidate the higher order structure and assembly of the Pdumicrocompartment. Structures will be investigated and analyzed by x-ray crystallographybiophysical and computational methods. Protein-protein binding studies will include his-tagpulldowns biophysical methods and crystallography. Functional and mechanistic insights willbe derived from structure-guided mutagenesis in conjunction with genetic and biochemicalstudies. Completion of the proposed investigations will elucidate the mechanistic and structuralprinciples of the Salmonella pdu microcompartment. This will provide general insights intobacterial microcompartments. Since bacterial microcompartments play critical metabolic roles inmany microbes including several human pathogens the proposed studies may ultimately leadto new opportunities for interfering with pathogenic processes.","Amino Acids;Bacteria;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Caliber;Cell physiology;Computing Methodologies;Crystallography;Diffusion;Drug Delivery Systems;Encapsulated;Enzymes;Family;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Higher Order Chromatin Structure;Homeostasis;Homologous Gene;Human;In Vitro;Investigation;Knowledge;Lead;Link;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic Pathway;Methods;Microbe;Modeling;Molecular;Movement;Mutagenesis;N-terminal;NADH;Organelles;Pathogenesis;Pharmacologic Substance;Play;Process;Production;Propylene Glycols;Protein-Protein Interaction Map;Proteins;Publishing;Recycling;Research;Role;Salmonella;Salmonella enterica;Salmonella typhimurium LT2;Site-Directed Mutagenesis;Specificity;Structure;Subcellular structure;System;Testing;Work;base;biophysical techniques;cofactor;cytotoxicity;design;enzyme substrate;improved;in vivo;insight;mutant;pathogen;prevent;structural biology;synthetic protein;three dimensional structure;tool","Dissecting the Structure and Function of the PDU Microcompartment in Salmonella","Project narrative: An improved understanding of bacterial microcompartments which arefound in many human pathogens may ultimately lead to new opportunities for interfering withpathogenic processes and may also provide a basis for the rational design of synthetic proteincages for use in the production of pharmaceuticals or as drug delivery vehicles","NIAID","9055625","4/13/2016","PA-11-260","4R01AI081146-07","4","R01","AI","081146","07","","ALEXANDER, WILLIAM A","5/1/2012","4/30/2017","Prokaryotic Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section[PCMB]"," ","1973143","BOBIK, THOMAS AQUINAS","YEATES, TODD O"," ","BIOCHEMISTRY","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","US","42.022225","-93.639475","3974801","IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY","AMES","IA","EARTH SCIENCES/RESOURCES","500112025","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2016","4/30/2017"," ","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","484465"," ","NIAID","398366","86099"," ","484465",
"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Emphysema; Lung; Smoking and Health; Tobacco","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to understand how thoracic multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) combined with innovative image analysis techniques can be used to identify COPD patients at greatest risk. The overall objective of this proposal is to focus on the pulmonary vasculature. We hypothesize that novel quantitative MDCT-based metrics that characterize heterogeneity of pulmonary parenchymal perfusion and pulmonary vascular anatomy in early stage COPD subjects will allow us to identify subjects at greater risk for rapid disease progression. Numerous observations from our own laboratories and others point to an abnormal pulmonary vascular response to smoking induced parenchymal inflammation that leads to the development of emphysema. We have established imaging methods for the quantitative assessment of the pulmonary vascular tree and regional pulmonary parenchymal perfusion status. The former measure takes advantage of volumetric MDCT and the later makes use of dual energy MDCT (DE-MDCT) to provide clinically implementable tools for the interrogation of lung structure and function. Our Specific Aims are as follows: (1) determine whether objective quantitative measures of increased PBV heterogeneity derived from DE-MDCT as an index of emphysema susceptibility will serve as a very early indicator of rapid emphysema progression (assessed by MDCT) and lung function decline; (2) determine whether anatomic changes in pulmonary vascular geometry will identify subjects at risk for more rapid emphysema progression and lung function decline possibly in more urgent need of intervention; and (3) determine whether early anatomic and functional markers of vascular disease will combine to identify subjects at increased risk for development of frequent exacerbations who require more intense therapy before significant lung function decline has occurred. In this time-sensitive proposal we will leverage the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS). SPIROMICS offers a unique opportunity to study at risk smokers and individuals with COPD in a longitudinal study that are well-characterized in terms of repeated clinical physiological and biological evaluations. We propose to insert a baseline DE-MDCT scan to evaluate an index of pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity (Perfused Blood Volume: PBV) in 200 GOLD 0/I subjects at baseline and to insert a 3rd year MDCT exam into the SPIROMICS protocol for these same individuals. We also propose a year 3 MDCT exam in an additional 125 GOLD II-III SPIROMICS subjects.

"Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Malaria; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related; Vector-Borne Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malaria caused by Plasmodium parasites remains an enormous global health problem. The blood-stage of the Plasmodium lifecycle causes malaria related morbidity and mortality and also results in formation of gametocytes that are required for the mosquito vector to transmit disease. Here we provide data that CD4 T cells in humans exposed to seasonal Plasmodium falciparum infections in Mali Africa upregulate a surface receptor PD-1 that is associated with an ""exhausted"" phenotype in chronic virus infections. To address the generality and relevance of this finding we applied a novel surrogate activation marker approach to track the total CD4 and CD8 T cell response in a mouse model of Plasmodium yoelii (Py) chronic blood-stage infection. Strikingly our results show that Py blood-stage infection results in substantial upregulation of surface inhibitory receptors on responding Tcells and that these cells exhibit impaired cytokine production demonstrating that they have undergone functional exhaustion. Of most relevance blocking inhibitory receptor interactions in mice with established chronic blood-stage Py infection results in immediate control of parasite replication and accelerated clearance of the parasite. New data show that inhibitory receptor blockade enhances CD4 T cell responses and B cells/antibody responses during blood-stage malaria.  These results support our long-term goal to understand how inhibitory receptor blockade impacts host immune responses to control clinical malaria. While development of efficacious vaccines and new anti-malarial drugs that target the parasite remain important approaches successful completion of our studies may reveal an alternative strategy of manipulating host immunity in an antigen-independent fashion for control of the symptomatic blood-stage of Plasmodium infection. We will address these long-term goals through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the T cell components resulting in accelerated clearance of blood-stage P. yoelii infection during inhibitory receptor blockade. Aim 2: Determine the B cell and antibody components resulting in accelerated clearance of blood-stage P. yoelii infection during inhibitory receptor blockade Aim 3. Determine the cellular and humoral basis whereby inhibitory receptor blockade results in complete clearance of persistent P. chabaudi chabaudi blood-stage infection. Aim 4.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Foodborne Illness; Infectious Diseases; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Campylobacter jejuni is a leading bacterial cause of diarrhea worldwide and is increasingly resistant to clinically important antibiotics. The CDC has recently identified drug resistant Campylobacter as a serious antibiotic resistance threat in the United States. Among the known mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance in Campylobacter the multidrug efflux system CmeABC (an RND-type efflux transporter) is a significant player and confers resistance to structurally diverse antibiotics and toxic compounds. Additionally CmeABC plays a critical role in bile resistance and is essential for Campylobacter colonization in the intestinal tract. Most recently it was found that CosR a response regulator fo oxidative stress serves as a repressor for cmeABC and modulates the expression of cmeABC in response to oxidative stress. These results strongly suggest that oxidative stress is a previously unidentified physiological signal modulating the function of CmeABC and the CosR-mediated response to oxidative stress may be important for the adaptation of C. jejuni a microaerobic organism that experiences oxidative stress during transmission and infection of a host. Despite strong preliminary evidence the detailed mechanisms of the interplay between oxidative stress and the CosR- CmeABC pathway and the role of this interaction in antibiotic and oxidative stress resistance are still unknown. To control antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter we recently developed a novel strategy that utilizes anti-cmeABC peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to inhibit the expression of cmeABC. This approach was found to be effective in sensitizing Campylobacter to antibiotics in cultures suggesting that antisense PNA targeting cmeABC is a promising approach for combating antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter. This application is based on these exciting findings and will pursue two Specific Aims i) to determine the mechanisms by which oxidative stress interacts with the CosR-CmeABC pathway and define the role of this interaction in Campylobacter adaptation to antibiotic and oxidative stresses and ii) to determine the efficiency of anti-cmeABC PNA in preventing the emergence of antibiotic resistant mutants and potentiating antibiotics against Campylobacter in animal models. The proposal is innovative both conceptually and technically as it addresses an emerging theme at the interface between oxidative stress response and antibiotic efflux systems and develops a novel anti-Campylobacter approach by targeting CmeABC. The proposed work will significantly advance the concept that oxidative stress sensing and resistance is a common physiological function of antibiotic efflux systems in bacterial pathogens and will develop an effective mean to extend the utility of existing antibiotics against drug-resistant Campylobacter. Furthermore the technical platform established in this project can be potentially adapted for the control of other antibioticresistant pathogens.      ","Address;Animal Model;Animals;Antibiotic Resistance;Antibiotic Therapy;Antibiotics;Bile fluid;Biology;Campylobacter;Campylobacter infection;Campylobacter jejuni;Categories;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Clinical Treatment;Country;Coupled;Culture Media;Cysteine;DNA Binding;Development;Diarrhea;Drug-resistant Campylobacter;Family;Fluoroquinolones;Funding;Gastroenteritis;Genes;Goals;Guillain-Barre Syndrome;In Vitro;Infection;Intestines;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;Laboratories;Macrolide Antibiotics;Macrolides;Mediating;Mutation;National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease;Organism;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Peptide Nucleic Acids;Physiological;Play;Poisons;Prevalence;Public Health;Regulation;Repression;Research;Resistance;Role;Signal Transduction;Stress;System;Transcription Repressor/Corepressor;United States;Vaccines;Work;antibiotic efflux;antimicrobial;base;biological adaptation to stress;combat;design;disorder prevention;efflux pump;enteric pathogen;enteritis;experience;fluoroquinolone resistance;in vivo Model;innovation;mutant;novel;novel strategies;pathogen;prevent;public health relevance;response;transmission process;trend","Function and inhibition of multidrug efflux systems in Campylobacter","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Campylobacter jejuni is a major enteric pathogen and the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter is a significant concern for public health.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Voltage-gated Cav1.4 Ca2+ channels are highly localized in the synaptic terminals of rod and cone photoreceptors. Ca2+ influx through these channels triggers the release of glutamate which initiates the transmission of visual information through the retinal circuitry and into the brain. Mutations in Cav1.4 cause several visual impairments including congenital stationary night blindness type 2 (CSNB2) cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and X-linked retinal disorder. These channelopathies illustrate the importance of Cav1.4 for normal vision as well as the need to understand how Cav1.4 channels are regulated. In contrast to our knowledge of other Cav1 channels little is known about the factors that influence Cav1.4 function. Therefore it is important to understand how altered Cav1.4 function causes visual impairments.  In this proposal I will address the importance of an alternatively spliced exon (exon 47) in the Cav1.4 distal C-terminal regulatory domain (DCRD); that is known to regulate channel activation and inactivation by interacting with regions in the proximal C-terminal regulatory domain (PCRD). This will be accomplished by determining the functional and structural significance of exon 47 on Cav1.4 activation and inactivation in HEK 293T cells using electrophysiological and biochemical methods (aim 1) and by characterizing the expression of the Cav1.4 splice variant in human retina using quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (aim 2).         ","Address;Alternative Splicing;Amino Acids;Binding;Biochemical;Brain;C-terminal;Calmodulin;Cells;Cone;Distal;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Excision;Exhibits;Exons;Feedback;Foundations;Future;Genes;Glutamates;Human;In Situ Hybridization;Kinetics;Knowledge;Length;Light;Link;Measures;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methods;Molecular;Mutation;Neurons;Night Blindness;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Photoreceptors;Presynaptic Terminals;Process;Property;RNA Splicing;Regulation;Research;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Cone;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Photoreceptors;Retinitis Pigmentosa;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Role;Sampling;Signal Transduction;Site;Techniques;Transcript;Variant;Vision;Visual;Visual impairment;Work;disease-causing mutation;insight;neurotransmitter release;prevent;public health relevance;retinal rods;transmission process;visual information;voltage;voltage clamp","Characterization of a Human Cav1.4 Splice Variant","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will provide an understanding of the structural elements that regulate Cav1.4 channels and insights into how alternative splice variants of Cav1.4 may contribute to visual signaling in the retina.         ","NEI","9053712","1/11/2016","PA-14-148","1F31EY026477-01","1","F31","EY","026477","01","","AGARWAL, NEERAJ ","6/17/2016","6/16/2019","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1 F05-U (20)]"," ","11642834","WILLIAMS, BRITTANY N.","Not Applicable","01","PHYSIOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/17/2016","6/16/2017"," ","867","Training, Individual","2016","28471"," ","NEI","28471"," "," ","28471",
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); Neurosciences; Pediatric; Substance Abuse","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Maternal drug addiction constitutes a major public health problem for both women and affected children with long lasting consequences on children's social emotional and cognitive development. Current treatment strategies tend to focus on the mother and her current addiction rather than her relationship with her child and developmental processes that may perpetuate the addiction problems such as unresolved childhood attachment trauma neglect and chronic stress. Unlike mothers who find engaging with their own infant to be a uniquely rewarding experience mothers with addictions may be less able to respond appropriately to their infant's cues finding them less intrinsically rewardin or salient and more stress provoking. Our current study has identified key areas in dopaminergic and oxytocinergic brain pathways that show a diminished functional MRI response when addicted mothers view the faces of their own vs. unknown infants compared with non- addicted mothers. These areas include the hypothalamus striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Oxytocin a neuropeptide with decreased peripheral levels seen in addicted mothers is integrally involved in maternal brain and behavioral responses. When administered intranasally our pilot data has shown enhanced activation of the striatum prefrontal cortex and amygdala. The purpose of this renewal grant is to continue and expand upon our investigation of maternal addiction by conducting a randomized double-blinded placebo- controlled crossover study of intranasal oxytocin on maternal brain responses. A new group of 150 mothers from our two current study sites (Baylor College of Medicine and the Yale Child Study Center) will be enrolled (75 with a history of drug addiction and 75 matched control mothers) along with their 4 to 7-month-old infants to participate in four study visits over a two-month period. During Visit 1 mothers will complete the Adult Attachment Interview to determine their attachment classification and to identify markers of unresolved trauma. At Visit 2 a videotaped free-play assessment of mother-infant interaction (the CARE-Index) and a modified Still Face Procedure will be conducted to assess the quality of maternal caregiving and synchrony. During the final two study visits functional MRI will be used to compare maternal brain responses to infant face cues after receiving either intranasal oxytocin or placebo comparing ""own"" vs. ""unknown"" happy and sad faces. We will focus on activation of and functional connectivity between the striatum prefrontal cortex and amygdala key reward and stress related regions containing oxytocinergic neuronal connections. We will also examine factors that may moderate oxytocin's effect in the brain including attachment classification mother-infant synchrony sensation-seeking or risk-taking behavior and stress/trauma exposure. This knowledge will contribute significantly to our long-term goal of discovering novel treatment strategies for mothers who suffer from drug dependency and addiction.","Adult;Affect;Amygdaloid structure;Area;Behavior;Brain;Brain imaging;Child;Child Abuse and Neglect;Childhood;Chronic stress;Classification;Code;Corpus striatum structure;Cross-Over Studies;Crossover Design;Crying;Cues;Data;Development;Developmental Process;Distress;Dopamine;Dorsal;Double-Blind Method;Drug Addiction;Emotional;Enrollment;Esthesia;Face;Family;Figs - dietary;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Glucocorticoids;Goals;Grant;Habits;Health;Hypothalamic structure;Individual Differences;Infant;Interview;Investigation;Knowledge;Literature;Maternal Behavior;Medicine;Modeling;Mothers;Motor output;Negative Valence;Neurons;Neuropeptides;Neurosecretory Systems;Oxytocin;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Placebo Control;Placebos;Play;Positive Valence;Predisposition;Prefrontal Cortex;Procedures;Process;Public Health;Randomized;Recording of previous events;Reporting;Research Domain Criteria;Rewards;Risk-Taking;Site;Smiling;Social Processes;Stress;Substantia nigra structure;System;Thalamic structure;Trauma;Ventral Striatum;Ventral Tegmental Area;Videotape;Visit;Woman;Work;addiction;behavioral response;biological adaptation to stress;brain circuitry;brain pathway;caregiving;cognitive development;college;drug of abuse;experience;indexing;maternal caregiving;neglect;novel;pediatric trauma;response;sensory input;social;treatment strategy","Oxytocin and Brain Reward and Stress Responses to Infant Cues in Addicted Mothers","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug addiction problems in mothers are of major public health significance for both the women and their affected children with long lasting consequences on children's social emotional and cognitive development.

"Antimicrobial Resistance; Biotechnology; Genetics; Hematology; Infectious Diseases; Septicemia","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The close biological similarity of fungi to mammals has made these organisms one of the best model systems for understanding eukaryotic biology. However this similarity has also limited development of selective antifungal therapies. Candidemias are the third most common blood stream infection (BSI). The species Candida glabrata (Cg) now constitutes the second most common Candida species associated with BSI. Part of this increased incidence of Cg driven candidemia comes from the ability of this species to acquire resistance to the major antifungal drug fluconazole. 30% of drug resistant candidemias are fatal making understanding the molecular physiology of acquired azole resistance of high priority. The most common genetic change leading to azole resistant Cg occurs via substitution mutations in a transcription factor called Pdr1. These mutations produce a hyperactive form of Pdr1 that drives strongly induced levels of downstream gene expression such as the ATP- binding cassette transporter-encoding gene called CDR1. Others have demonstrated that hyperactive forms of Pdr1 also exhibit hypervirulence in a disseminated model of infection along with elevated azole resistance. Recent chromatin immunoprecipitation-next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments from my lab have identified new genes uniquely regulated by Pdr1 in Cg when compared to the previously characterized Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pdr1 protein. The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of these new genes in drug resistance and virulence in Cg. We will use a new assay for virulence employing a rodent model for central venous catheter infections. These type of infections are a serious clinical complication (mortality approaches 40%) and has not previously been used to evaluate the genetic basis of Cg infection. We will also perform further ChIP-seq analyses to determine the target gene spectrum of hyperactive alleles of PDR1 as well as azole-induced Pdr1. Disruption of key target genes identified by ChIP-seq will allow us to identify the Pdr1-regulated target genes that contribute to drug resistance and virulence in the clinical setting. Wehave also used mass spectrometry to identify a deubiquitinase subunit (Bre5) that interacts with and regulates Pdr1. Preliminary data suggest that loss of Bre5 leads to an accumulation of a higher molecular weight form of Pdr1. We will use biochemical and genetic analyses to determine the role of ubiquitin in Pdr1 regulation and investigate the regulatory role of other proteins that co-purify with Pdr1. Finally we will carry out forward genetic analyses to functionally identify proteins that regulate Pdr1 activity. This multidisciplinary approach will provide a detailed picture of Pdr1 regulation a central modulator of azole resistance and virulence in Cg.      ","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters;Address;Alleles;Amino Acid Substitution;Anabolism;Animal Model;Antibiotics;Antifungal Agents;Antifungal Therapy;Azole resistance;Azoles;Binding Proteins;Biochemical Genetics;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Biology;Blood;C-terminal;CDR1 gene;Candida;Candida albicans;Candida glabrata;Carrier Proteins;Catheters;Cell membrane;Clinical;Complication;Data;Development;Drug Efflux;Drug Resistance Multiple Fungal;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Drug resistance pathway;Employee Strikes;Ergosterol;Exhibits;Fluconazole;Fluconazole resistance;Fungal Drug Resistance;Gene Expression;Gene Proteins;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genomics;Goals;Health;Incidence;Infection;Lipids;Mammals;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Mediating;Medical;Microbe;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Weight;Multi-Drug Resistance;Mutation;Mycoses;Organism;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiology;Plasmid Cloning Vector;Proteins;Regulation;Regulator Genes;Research;Resistance;Resistance development;Resistant candida;Rodent Model;Role;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;Sepsis;Sequence Analysis;Source;Stream;Study models;System;Ubiquitin;Venous;Virulence;Work;Zinc Cluster;acquired drug resistance;antimicrobial;antimicrobial drug;base;candidemia;chromatin immunoprecipitation;clinically significant;cofactor;combat;design;efflux pump;fungus;genetic analysis;infectious disease treatment;interdisciplinary approach;member;mortality;next generation sequencing;pathogen;prevent;research study;response;success;transcription factor","Genetic analysis of pleiotropic drug resistance","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding fungal multidrug resistance is crucial because relatively few antifungal compounds exist.

"Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic musculoskeletal pain affects more Americans than diabetes heart disease and cancer combined according to the recent 2011 Institute of Medicine Pain Report. Pain is not simply a direct link between peripheral injury and the brain; both peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) modulation contribute to highly complex pain processing. Increasingly central sensitization of pain pathways is being recognized as an important component of persistent pain but as central sensitization is a neuronal response in humans it can only be indirectly assessed through psychophysical testing. Various evoked measures believed to be centrally-mediated; either through facilitated excitation (e.g. temporal summation of pain) or disinhibition (e.g. conditioned pain modulation CPM) have been used to test for central mechanisms in a variety of musculoskeletal patient populations. Unfortunately little has been done to characterize these central sensitivity assessments thus it is unclear whether a single measure is equally representative of central involvement. While peripheral pain sensitivity phenotypes are modality-specific e.g. individuals sensitive to heat pain are not necessarily sensitive to ischemic or cold pain central sensitivity phenotypes have yet to be systematically examined. We are able to model central sensitization in humans using experimental muscle pain: referred pain and hyperalgesia at the ankle occurs in ~60% of individuals with intramuscular acidic infusion of the anterior tibialis. Thus we can use this modelto test whether central sensitivity assessments are predictive of the development of referred pain. The first aim will characterize multiple central sensitivity phenotypes in humans: temporal summation of pain (i.e. punctate deep-pressure and heat) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM i.e. hypoalgesia to pressure and heat pain following noxious cold conditioning stimulus) and use cluster analyses to subgroup individuals based on their responses. The second aim will determine the likelihood that central sensitivity phenotypes are predictive of a model of central sensitization (i.e. referred pain). We will use logistic regression to determine the odd ratios of experiencing this reversible form of central sensitization between central sensitivity clusters. This study will either validate or challenge the common practice of using one or more of these assessments as equivalent markers of central sensitization in patient populations. When completed these data can be used to direct and inform future studies as well as interpret previous findings in clinical populations. Long-term this information will be valuable for optimizing personalized therapies for patients with persistent pain conditions.","Address;Adult;Affect;American;Ankle;Brain Injuries;Chronic;Clinical;Cluster Analysis;Complex;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disinhibition;Equilibrium;Experimental Models;Future;Goals;Health;Heart Diseases;Heating;Heterogeneity;Human;Hyperalgesia;Individual;Infusion procedures;Institute of Medicine (U.S.);Intramuscular;Knowledge;Link;Logistic Regressions;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Modality;Modeling;Musculoskeletal;Musculoskeletal Pain;Myalgia;Neuraxis;Neurons;Normal Range;Odds Ratio;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pain-Free;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Persistent pain;Phenotype;Population;Population Control;Process;Psychophysics;Reporting;Research;Role;Secondary Hyperalgesias;Stimulus;Subgroup;Sum;Testing;Tissues;Variant;base;central pain;central sensitization;cohort;conditioning;experience;insight;patient population;peripheral pain;personalized medicine;pressure;prevent;response;sound;tibialis anterior muscle;tool","Phenotyping Evoked Central Sensitivity to Painful Stimuli","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Various pain assessments are currently used to investigate whether the central nervous system is contributing to persistent pain conditions.

The OR-DBM MRMC methodology takes into account variability among both patients and radiologists so that study conclusions generalize to both patient and radiologist populations. The OR-DBM MRMC software is the most widely used ROC software for MRMC diagnostic imaging studies.  It was recently shown (Hillis 2014) that the OR-DBM method can be extended to many other study de- signs; however it does not make sense to include analyses for new study designs in software that is rapidly becoming obsolete. A critical need exists to rewrite OR-DBM MRMC in Java to maintain and extend it going forward. Without rewriting the software in Java no future innovation can be incorporated into the OR-DBM MRMC software nor will it be possible to create versions to run on current and future operating systems. Our long-term goal is to continue to develop MRMC analysis methods and to make these available using user- friendly freely-available software. The primary objective in this application is to create a crossplatform OR- DBM MRMC package by rewriting the majority of the components in the current software in Java. The secondary objective is to enhance the software by providing several new features.  To achieve these objectives the following specific aims are proposed: (1) create a cross-platform version of OR-DBM MRMC that will run on current and future versions of Windows OS X and Linux; (2) enhance the software by adding several new features such as new analysis options the graphical display of fitted and empirical ROC curves and alternative free-response ROC and region-of-interest analysis.  The expected outcome of this project is an extensible cross-platform codebase to serve as the foundation for OR-DBM MRMC for many years to come. In addition the methodology will be enhanced with several new features making it much more of a ""one-stop shop"" software package where the user can do both single- and multi-reader analyses single- and multi-modality analyses alternative free-response ROC (AFROC) and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses easily produce graphical displays of the ROC curves and seamlessly export estimates needed for power and sample size estimation in our sample size software These contributions are significant because they preserve OR-DBM MRMC as an accessible methodology for researchers while simultaneously enhancing its usefulness. The positive impact will be the continued availability of the software for the analysisof technology evaluation and observer performance.","Accounting;Applications Grants;Biomedical Technology;Case Study;Code;Computer software;Development;Diagnostic Errors;Diagnostic Imaging;Ensure;Evaluation;Foundations;Future;Goals;Grant;Health;Image;Imaging technology;Individual;Java;Lead;Leadership;Libraries;Linux;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modality;National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering;Operating System;Outcome;Output;Patients;Performance;Play;Population;Programming Languages;Published Comment;Radiology Specialty;Reader;Receiver Operating Characteristics;Research Design;Research Personnel;Resources;Role;Running;Sample Size;Source;Source Code;Technology;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Update;Writing;base;curve fitting;design;diagnostic accuracy;graphical user interface;improved;innovation;interest;novel strategies;programs;radiologist;response;software development;user-friendly","Modern ROC Software for Multi- and Single-Reader Diagnostic Imaging Studies","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Providing researchers with the means to properly assess the diagnostic accuracy of new imaging technology will lead to a reduction in diagnostic errors in radiology.

"Bioengineering; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Networking and Information Technology R&D; Neurosciences; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Currently the clinical assessment of optic nerve swelling is limited by the subjective ophthalmoscopic evaluation by experts in order to diagnose and differentiate the cause of the optic disc edema. The long-term goal of our research effort is to develop automated 3D image-analysis approaches for the identification of an optimal set of 3D parameters to quantify the severity of optic nerve edema over time and to help differentiate the underlying cause. The overall objective in this application is to develop strategies using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve swelling in patients diagnosed with papilledema and to ascertain morphological features that differentiate papilledema from other disorders causing optic nerve edema. The central hypothesis is that information about volumetric and shape parameters obtainable from 3D image analysis techniques will improve the ability to accurately assess the severity and cause of optic disc edema over the existing subjective ophthalmoscopic assessment of optic nerve swelling using the Frisn scale or current 2D OCT parameters. The rationale for the proposed research is that having such 3D parameters will dramatically improve the way optic disc swelling is assessed. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1. Develop and evaluate the methodology for computing novel volumetric and shape parameters of a swollen optic nerve head from SD-OCT. This will be completed by refining and evaluating our novel 3D graph-based segmentation algorithms in SD-OCT volumes of patients with optic disc swelling. 2. Identify SD-OCT parameters that optimally correlate with clinical measurements of severity in patients with papilledema and develop a continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to relate SD-OCT parameters to expert-defined Frisn scale grades (a fundus-based measure of severity). It is anticipated that volumetric 3D parameters will more closely correlate with clinical measures than 2D parameters and will provide a continuous severity scale. 3. Identify SD-OCT parameters that differentiate papilledema from other causes of optic disc swelling (or apparent optic disc swelling as in pseudopapilledema) and develop a corresponding predictive classifier. Our working hypothesis is that 3D shape parameters especially those near Bruch's membrane opening will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the 3D image-analysis methodology developed by the applicants enables novel determination of 3D volumetric and shape parameters and represents a significant improvement over the status quo of using qualitative image information and 2D OCT image information for assessing optic disc swelling. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish a much-needed alternative and more objective method by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling.","Acute;Algorithms;Blindness;Bruch&apos;s basal membrane structure;Clinical;Clinical assessments;Computer software;Computing Methodologies;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic Procedure;Dimensions;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Edema;Evaluation;Eye diseases;Fundus;Goals;Graph;Health;Image;Imaging Techniques;Intracranial Hypertension;Knowledge;Machine Learning;Measurement;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Mission;Modality;Monitor;Nerve Fibers;Optic Disk;Optic Nerve;Optical Coherence Tomography;Papilledema;Patients;Process;Public Health;Research;Resolution;Severities;Shapes;Staging;Structure;Swelling;Techniques;Testing;Thick;Three-Dimensional Image;Time;Vision;Work;base;cost;digital;disability burden;expectation;improved;innovation;instrument;novel;optic nerve disorder","3D Image Analysis Approach to Determine Severity and Cause of Optic Nerve Edema","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of novel spectral-domain optical coherence tomography parameters for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema is expected to enable more efficient and effective diagnosis and management strategies of patients with such swelling.

Like other age-related diseases AMD is particularly challenging to study because it takes decades to develop and so any research model must recapitulate the conditions of an older organism.  Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and linkage analyses have provided the first clues to what might cause AMD. These studies identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strong risk factors for AMD.1 One SNP lies in the 402H allele in the CFH gene and the two others are tightly linked and lie in the neighboring HTRA1 and ARMS2 genes. These SNPs confer the most significant genetic risk factors in the history of GWAS studies in human genetics. People homozygous for these SNPs have a 50-fold increased risk of AMD.  How these mutations might cause sight to deteriorate is unclear however because the underlying molecular mechanisms of AMD are unknown. Recently however our unbiased proteome analysis suggested super oxide dismutase (SOD) mechanisms are perturbed in affected cells and that over time this introduces reactive oxidative species (ROS) mediated cellular insults that eventually manifest as AMD. If ROS metabolism is indeed disrupted in AMD then we might finally begin to address the causes of the disease.  We believe the hurdles faced in finding causes and treatments for AMD could be circumvented by stem cell technologies. To this end we have found a way to differentiate stem cells from patients into retinal cells. Moreover we developed a protocol that recapitulates aging in these patient-stem-cell-derived retinal cells. Finally through gene-targeting technology we can manipulate the stem cell genome targeting disease- associated SNPs to determine the individual contributions of each. By applying these powerful methodologies we believe we can finally identify the root causes of AMD and so begin to develop new therapies.  Our goals will be accomplished in two specific aims: Aim 1A. Use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to convert HTRA1 and ARMS2 alleles from low-risk to high risk in patient-derived stem cells. Aim 1B. Determine the individual contribution of human HTRA1 and ARMS2 alleles to AMD pathogenesis. Test whether CRISPR conversion from low to high-risk AMD alleles in Aim 1A affects ROS levels in cells. Aim 2. Test the function of patient-stem-cell-derived RPE in a human-mouse chimera in vivo assay.","Address;Affect;Age related macular degeneration;Aging;Alleles;Antioxidants;Biological Assay;Blindness;CRISPR/Cas technology;Cell Line;Cell Transplants;Cells;Chimera organism;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Complication;Country;Disease;Eye;Finding by Cause;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Genome;Goals;Health;Heterozygote;Human;Human Genetics;Individual;Link;Mediating;Metabolism;Methodology;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Names;Organism;Oxides;Pathogenesis;Patients;Plant Roots;Proteome;Protocols documentation;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recording of previous events;Research;Retinal;Retinal Degeneration;Risk;Risk Factors;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Stem cells;System;Technology;Testing;Time;Transplantation;Vision;age related;cellular engineering;gene function;genetic linkage analysis;genetic risk factor;genome wide association study;graft function;high risk;in vivo;induced pluripotent stem cell;innovation;novel therapeutics;retinal damage;risk variant;stem cell technology","Evaluating GWAS AMD Candidate Loci by Gene Editing in Human iPS Cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of retinal damage the leading cause of blindness in Western countries and as the name implies a disease of aging.

"Cancer; Diagnostic Radiology; Radiation Oncology","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma the fastest growing cancer incidence in the world today and the American Cancer Society reports that death rates for melanoma continue to rise. Alarmingly melanoma is the most common cancer in young adults under 30. One characteristic of metastatic melanoma cells that is recognized as a potential target for new therapies is upregulation of cell-surface receptor melanocortin subtype I (MCR1). However there are no agents currently available that exploit this identifiable difference between melanoma and normal cells. This proposal is focused on development validation and commercialization of an automated system for the preparation of [203/212Pb]-labeled peptides that bind with high affinity and specificity to MCR1 for targeted imaging and therapy of metastatic melanoma. Our innovative approach enlists matched-pair isotopes 203Pb/212Pb to enable quantitative dosimetry based on 203Pb-SPECT imaging for 212Pb-alpha-particle therapy. Viewpoint Molecular Targeting LLC has developed a strong-strategic business-partnerships that are driving our commercialization of diagnostic/therapeutic agents [203Pb]DOTA-VMT-MCR1/[212Pb]DOTA-VMT-MCR1. Matched pair isotopes 203Pb/212Pb is also attractive due to a relatively long half-life (51 h) of 203Pb which is favorable for centralied manufacturing of radiotracers for their direct shipment to imaging facilities.  Our overall objectie is to develop effective image-guided therapy for metastatic melanoma that will improve outcomes for melanoma patients with fewer-milder side effects than current therapies. To achieve these objectives we propose the following specific aims: 1. Determine the feasibility of an automated cassette- based fluid handling system for clinical manufacturing of 203/212Pb labeled chelator-modified VMT-MCR1; and 2. Determine the feasibility of [203/212Pb]TCMC-VMT-MCR1 and [203/212Pb]C2N2-VMT-MCR1 for molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy for metastatic melanoma.  With success in our Aims we expect to determine the feasibility of an automated system to produce high specific activity 203/212Pb VMT-MCR1 under Aim 1. We further expect to have determined the feasibility of three VMT-MCR1 compositions to advance to clinical imaging trials via an eIND under Aim 2. We expect these successes to have the positive impact of advancing VMT-MCR1 through initial commercial risk-mitigating milestones to a first in humans imaging trial with 203Pb VMT-MCR1. We expect this to lead to 212Pb VMT-MCR1 therapy which has the potential to circumvent drug resistance that limits the effectiveness of current treatments for metastatic melanoma.      ","Adverse effects;Affinity;Alpha Particles;American Cancer Society;Automobile Driving;Binding;Businesses;Cancer Patient;Cell Surface Receptors;Characteristics;Chelating Agents;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Coupling;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Death Rate;Development;Diagnostic;Dose;Drug resistance;Effectiveness;Half-Life;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography;Human;Image;In Vitro;Incidence;Investigational Drugs;Investigational New Drug Application;Iowa;Isotopes;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Legal patent;Life Expectancy;Liquid substance;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Manufacturer Name;Medical Imaging;Melanoma Cell;Metastatic Melanoma;Missouri;Molecular Target;Mus;National Cancer Institute;Normal Cell;Pathway interactions;Patient Selection;Patients;Peptides;Phase;Preparation;Product Labeling;Production;Published Comment;Publishing;Radiation;Radioisotopes;Radiolabeled;Radionuclide Generators;Radionuclide therapy;Radiopharmaceuticals;Reporting;Research;Resistance;Resistance development;Risk;Secure;Specificity;Staging;System;Systemic Therapy;Therapeutic Agents;Tomography Emission-Computed Single-Photon;Toxicology;Universities;Up-Regulation;Validation;base;chelation;commercialization;design;dosimetry;falls;image guided;image guided therapy;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;innovation;manufacturing process;meetings;melanocortin receptor;melanoma;molecular imaging;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;oncology;particle therapy;pre-clinical;preclinical study;public health relevance;radiotracer;success;targeted imaging;targeted treatment;theranostics;treatment planning;tumor;young adult","Production of Image-Guided Metastatic Melanoma Therapy Radiopharmaceuticals","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal is aimed to establish the feasibility of a novel automated system for the preparation of 203Pb and 212Pb - labeled peptide conjugates for clinical imaging and image guided therapy of metastatic melanoma.

Ovarian cancer survivors often experience high levels of distress sleep disturbances fatigue neuropathies multiple symptoms and side effects and existential concerns along with a generally poor prognosis. Additionally we have documented strong links between psychosocial factors and physiological pathways related to disease progression in ovarian cancer. Because of compromises to many aspects of quality of life (QOL) combined with low rates of survival for the majority of these patients development of innovative approaches for improving QOL is of paramount importance but research examining the potential efficacy of psychosocial interventions in ovarian cancer survivors has been extremely limited. Barriers to development of an in-person intervention have included low populations of ovarian cancer survivors at any one site and debility of patients. Based on focus interview feedback from ovarian cancer survivors we have been developing an intervention targeted to ovarian cancer survivors drawing from key elements of Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) along with some of the value-based content of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Over the last year we have developed a mobile responsive web platform to deliver a live web-based conferencing psychosocial intervention that ovarian cancer patients can access from their homes. The primary goal of this application is further development web deployment field usability and fieldtesting of this intervention among ovarian cancer survivors. The ultimate goal of this program of research will be to conduct a larger scale randomized clinical trial of this intervention using webdelivery with examination of mood symptoms and QOL along with clinically relevant endpoints and biomarkers.

"Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Neurosciences; Rehabilitation","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: Speech sounds are the most important sounds that humans hear yet little is known about the functional properties of the interconnected auditory and auditory-related brain regions that are essential to normal speech perception. Our research goal is to understand where and how speech information is processed within this network. We use novel combinations of complementary invasive and non-invasive experimental methods to study these brain regions in neurosurgery patients who require placement of chronic intracranial electrodes. These experiments involve combining direct cortical electrophysiological recordings with electrical stimulation techniques and anatomical and functional MRI methods. Our investigative strategy makes use of these unique experimental opportunities to overcome long-standing barriers to progress in this research field. Recent methodological advances now enable us to simultaneously study neural processing and connectivity at all levels of this network and directly test neural models of speech perception in human subjects. We will pursue our goals by testing hypotheses regarding: (1) the locations and functional properties of auditory cortical fields and auditory-related cortices of the temporal and frontal lobes (2) the functionalconnections between these areas and other regions of the human brain and (3) the directional flow of speech information within this network. These objectives are pursued by an experienced multidisciplinary group of investigators with expertise encompassing all required clinical and research topic areas. To our knowledge the resulting data will be the first of its kind to directl demonstrate how speech information is processed at all levels of the temporal-frontal lobe auditory cortical system and to directly demonstrate point-to-point functional connections between these cortical network regions and sites elsewhere in the human brain.

"Neurosciences; Pain Conditions - Chronic; Pain Research; Physical Activity; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regular physical activity (exercise) can reduce pain in people with chronic musculoskeletal pain; whereas unaccustomed exercise can exacerbate pain. This apparent dichotomy in pain response to physical activity is poorly understood making exercise prescription for individuals with pain challenging. In sedentary mice a single bout of exercise enhances the nociceptive response to subthreshold muscle stimuli (pH 5.0 saline); this enhancement is prevented by 5 days of voluntary running wheel activity. Further in mice the development of chronic muscle pain induced by repeated intramuscular acid (pH 4.0) injections is prevented by 8 weeks of voluntary running wheel activity. Regular exercise is believed to activate central inhibitory pathways that produce an opioid-mediated analgesia; the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is a key central nucleus in opioid-induced analgesia. However little data is available to support a role for central opioid mechanisms in exercise-induced analgesia particularly in conditions of chronic pain. Our preliminary data show that the analgesic effect of 8 weeks of running wheel activity (i.e. regular exercise) is reversed by systemic blockade of opioid receptors establishing that opioids are important in regular exercise-induced analgesia. Our preliminary data show that there is increased p-NR1 (NMDA receptor) in the RVM in sedentary animals after a single-bout of exercise or induction chronic muscle pain. These increases in p-NR1 in the RVM however are prevented by regular exercise suggesting that p-NR1 is modulated by mechanisms activated by exercise. These data led to our central hypothesis that regular exercise enhances activation of central inhibitory pathways that utilize endogenous opioids to modulate p-NR1 in the RVM. We will address our central aim through the following specific aims. Aim 1 will determine if regular physical activity (running wheel exercise) prevents the development of chronic muscle pain and if such an effect is associated with motor and autonomic responses that might occur in response to exercise training and activation of the RVM. Aim 2 will determine if regular physical activity prevents the development of hyperalgesia by activation of opioid receptors. We will test this by pharmacological and genetic manipulation of opioid receptors. Aim 3 will explore the neural circuitry involved in the enhanced nociception to unaccustomed physical activity and the analgesia produced by regular physical activity.

"Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over half a million coronary interventions are performed every year in the US. However the growing population of diabetic patients have a 30% increased risk of restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia after coronary intervention demonstrating that effective treatment for diabetic patients remains a major issue in cardiovascular medicine. A major contributor to diabetic vascular disease is mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) due to an excess of metabolic substrates and overload of mitochondrial respiration. Recently Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was found in mitochondria where it signals through mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) to increase Ca2+ entry into mitochondria. Ca2+ influx into mitochondria is known to drive metabolism through the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. Sustained mtROS elevations lead to global ROS increases which promote vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation a major contributor to neointimal hyperplasia. The objective of my application is to determine how CaMKII in VSMC regulates mitochondrial metabolism and ROS production in diabetes and directly test whether its inhibition in mitochondria abrogates neointimal hyperplasia in diabetes in vivo. I hypothesize that mitochondrial CaMKII promotes neointimal hyperplasia in diabetes through increased mitochondrial ROS production resulting from ineffective metabolic activity. To test this hypothesis I will utilize an in vivo model of diabetes in mice with VSMC-specific mitochondrial CaMKII inhibition (mtCaMKIIN mice) to discover if they have less mtROS less mitochondrial Ca2+ loading and protection from neointimal hyperplasia. I will also dissect the mechanism for mtCaMKII's role in mitochondrial metabolism of VSMC using cutting edge techniques to assess metabolic activity. My studies will test the hypothesis through two specific aims: 1) test whether mtCaMKII inhibition reduces neointimal hyperplasia in diabetes mellitus; 2) determine the mechanisms by which mtCaMKII controls mtROS production and metabolic activity. These studies will establish how mitochondrial CaMKII and mitochondrial Ca2+ contribute to mtROS production in diabetic restenosis and to determine whether these represent viable targets for future therapeutic development.      ","Attenuated;Blood Vessels;Calcium;Calmodulin;Cardiovascular system;Carotid Arteries;Cause of Death;Citric Acid Cycle;Coronary;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Angiopathies;Disease;Electron Transport;Figs - dietary;Fostering;Future;Goals;Health;Hyperglycemia;Hyperplasia;Injury;Intervention;Knowledge;Lead;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Medicine;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mission;Mitochondria;Molecular;Morphology;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Oxidative Stress;Oxidoreductase;Patients;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphotransferases;Population;Procedures;Production;Public Health;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research;Respiration;Risk;Role;Severities;Signal Transduction;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Stents;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Model;Tricarboxylic Acids;Vascular Smooth Muscle;base;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;diabetic;diabetic patient;effective therapy;feeding;glycosylation;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;injured;migration;mitochondrial metabolism;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;overexpression;pre-doctoral;prevent;public health relevance;research study;response;restenosis;stroke;therapeutic development;uptake;vascular smooth muscle cell migration;vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation","The role of mitochondrial CaMKII in diabetic vascular restenosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims at understanding a key regulator in the response to vascular injury with the ultimate goal of exploring the therapeutic potential ofits inhibition.

"Genetics; Infectious Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All viruses depend on the host's translation (protein synthesis) machinery. For this reason host cells have evolved numerous antiviral mechanisms that shut down or otherwise regulate translation. In the molecular arms race viruses in turn have evolved ways to bypass host translational control. It is this essential step in virus replication that is the focus of this proposal. Host mRNAs contain a 5' ""cap"" structure and a 3' poly(A) tail that interact with translation initiation factors which recruit the ribosome to the mRNA. In contrast the RNAs of most RNA viruses are uncapped so they have evolved RNA structures that recruit the ribosome by noncanonical cap-independent mechanisms. Many uncapped plant viral RNAs contain a cap-independent translation element (CITE) in the 3' untranslated region that facilitates efficient ribosome entry at the 5' end of the genome. In NIH-funded research the PI's lab showed that this is facilitated by long-distance base pairing between the 3' CITE which binds a translation initiation factor and the 5' untranslated region. Unanswered is how the CITE RNA structure causes it to bind a translation initiation factor with high affinity leading to recruitment of the ribosome. Here a variety of approaches will be applied to determine the structural requirements of two unrelated 3' CITEs and the translation factors with which they interact. These include (i) the Barley yellow dwarf virus-like translation element (BTE) which binds and requires initiation factor eIF4G and not eIF4E; and (ii) the Panicum mosaic virus-like translation element (PTE) which binds and requires eIF4E - a protein known previously to bind only to the 5' cap structure. The three aims all can be performed independently but the knowledge gained from each will feed into the other two aims. Aim I uses multiple factor-depletable translation systems of mutant CITEs and mutant cognate translation factors with which they interact. This will reveal the key nucleotides and amino acids required forinteraction and translation function. The second aim uses a variety of methods to measure the interactions of the mutant CITEs with mutant translation factors. The third aim will determine CITE structure at high resolution by ion-dependent RNA folding and X-ray crystallography methods. This project will provide a new understanding of the way in which viruses take over the cell which may in turn suggest potential targets for antiviral drugs. Although this work focuses on model plant viruses many growing human viruses such as dengue and hepatitis C viruses use similar mechanisms. Also this work will shed new light on how the translational machinery works and the translation system is extremely highly conserved between plants and animals. For example the PTE functions in mammalian cells and we will use human cells and extracts to study how it uses eIF4E to usurp the ribosomes. Over-active eIF4E causes tumors and restriction of its function inhibits many types of cancers. The tightly binding PTE RNA may provide structural knowledge for design of eIF4E-inhibiting cancer therapeutics.","3&apos; Untranslated Regions;5&apos; Untranslated Regions;Affinity;Amino Acids;Animal Experimentation;Animals;Anisotropy;Antiviral Agents;Base Pairing;Behavior;Beryllium;Binding;Binding Sites;Biological Assay;Bypass;Cell Extracts;Cells;Complex;Crystallization;Data Collection;Dengue;Elements;Enhancers;Experimental Designs;Funding;Gene Expression;Genome;Goals;Health;Hepatitis C virus;Human;Hydroxyl Radical;In Vitro;Indium;Infection;Ions;Knowledge;Light;Luteovirus;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammalian Cell;Maps;Measures;Medicine;Messenger RNA;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mosaic Viruses;Nucleotides;Oncogenes;Panicum;Peptide Initiation Factors;Phase;Plant Viruses;Plants;Poly(A) Tail;Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis;Production;Protein Biosynthesis;Proteins;Protoplasts;RNA;RNA Binding;RNA Folding;RNA Recognition Motif;RNA Viruses;Race;Recruitment Activity;Research;Resolution;Ribosomes;Scaffolding Protein;Scanning;Structure;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Translations;Twin Multiple Birth;United States National Institutes of Health;Viral;Viral Genome;Virus;Virus Replication;Work;X-Ray Crystallography;arm;cancer type;design;feeding;in vivo;interest;mutant;novel;protein purification;therapeutic protein;translation factor;tumor;viral RNA","Control of cap-independent translation by a viral 3' UTR","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research explores mechanisms by which model plant viruses take over the protein synthesis (translation) machinery of the host cell.

"Cancer; Clinical Research; Digestive Diseases; Orphan Drug; Pancreatic Cancer; Radiation Oncology; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is increasing in incidence. Intravenous ascorbate (i.e. ascorbic acid vitamin C) but not oral ascorbate produces high plasma concentrations which are in the range that are cytotoxic to tumor cells. Studies from our currently funded 2 year U01 grant CA166800 ""Ascorbate-induced radiosensitization in pancreatic cancer"" have demonstrated that ascorbate in doses achievable in humans synergizes with ionizing radiation in decreasing viability and proliferation in all pancreatic cancr cell lines examined via a H2O2-mediated mechanism. Our recently completed phase I study demonstrated that pharmacological ascorbate combined with gemcitabine is safe and well-tolerated and may lead to overall clinical benefit in patients with stage IV pancreatic cancer. Thi proposal focuses on improvement of the therapeutic ratio of a standard anti-cancer therapy (ionizing radiation) using a complementary approach (high dose ascorbate) in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. If pancreatic cancer cells (relative to normal cells) are more susceptible to ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity due to increased ascorbate auto-oxidation leading to increased H2O2 production then ascorbate would be expected to be efficacious and well-tolerated adjuvant to chemo-radiation in patients. Furthermore increasing the rate of auto- oxidation of ascorbate with redox active metal catalysts to generate more H2O2 should selectively increase ascorbate-induced radiosensitization and oxidative stress. Finally ascorbate-induced radiosensitization would be expected to sensitize tumor cells to clinically relevant pharmacological agents that inhibit the removal of H2O2. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that production of H2O2 via the metal ion catalyzed auto- oxidation of ascorbate mediates ascorbate-induced cytotoxicity and chemo-radiosensitization in human pancreatic cancer. We will test our hypothesis with the following three Specific Aims. 1) Determine in a phase I trial the safety of administering pharmacological ascorbate during concurrent gemcitabine-radiation therapy for the treatment of non-resectable pancreatic cancer; 2) Determine if ascorbate-induced radiosensitization can be selectively enhanced by redox active metal catalysts; 3) Determine if the ascorbate-induced radiosensitization can be enhanced by clinically relevant pharmacological inhibitors of glucose and hydroperoxide metabolism. The phase I trial will quantify adverse events and determine changes in systemic parameters indicative of oxidative stress in patients. The preclinical studies will use biochemistry/molecularbiology techniques to determine ascorbate-induced radiosensitization and oxidative stress and employ a non- invasive in vivo index of cell proliferation. If we can rigorously demonstrate that the radiosensitization mediated by pharmacological ascorbate induces preferential oxidative stress and subsequent cytotoxicity in human pancreatic cancer cells then the results of this proposed research program will provide a foundation for the rational design of a novel combined modality cancer therapy for pancreatic cancer.","Adjuvant;Adverse event;Ascorbic Acid;Biochemical;Biochemistry;Cancer Etiology;Cancer cell line;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Cessation of life;Clinical;Diagnosis;Disease;Dose;Drug Delivery Systems;Drug Targeting;Excision;Foundations;Funding;Glucose;Grant;Health;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;In Vitro;Incidence;Intravenous;Ionizing radiation;Ions;Lead;Left;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Manganese;Mediating;Medicine;Metabolic;Metabolism;Metals;Molecular Biology Techniques;Newsletter;Normal Cell;Oral;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pancreas;Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma;Patients;Plasma;Prodrugs;Production;Radiation;Radiation Tolerance;Radiation therapy;Radiation-Sensitizing Agents;Radiosensitization;Reporting;Research;Safety;Staging;Testing;Therapeutic;United States;Work;ascorbate;cancer cell;cancer therapy;catalyst;chemoradiation;clinically relevant;combined cancer modality therapy;cytotoxic;cytotoxicity;design;gemcitabine;improved;in vivo;indexing;inhibitor/antagonist;neoplastic cell;novel;novel strategies;oxidation;pancreatic cancer cells;pancreatic neoplasm;personalized care;phase 1 study;phase I trial;preclinical study;programs;radio-sensitizes;response","Pharmacological Ascorbate as a Radiosensitizer in Pancreatic Cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Intravenous ascorbate produces high plasma concentrations in the range that is cytotoxic to pancreatic tumor cells.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Cost Effectiveness Research; Health Services; Heart Disease; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 2200 deaths in Americans every day with one death every 39 seconds. There is evidence that these deaths can be prevented with better risk factor management however many risk factors remain uncontrolled. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (Medical Home) which includes self-management personalized health records and team-based care has been proposed as a strategy to reduce these gaps in care delivery. Several Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses have found evidence that adding pharmacists to the primary care team improves risk factor control and physician adherence to guidelines. Managed care organizations have found that a centralized cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) managed by pharmacists can reduce mortality. It is not known if a comprehensive CVRS model would be implemented in typical office practices and this lack of evidence is a major gap in the literature.  The objective of this application is t conduct a multi-center cluster-randomized study utilizing a centralized CVRS in medical offices with large geographic racial and ethnic diversity to determine the extent to which the CVRS model will be implemented. We will randomize 16 primary care offices to the CVRS or usual care and enroll 400 subjects of which 220 subjects will be from racial minorities. We will also select 25 patients per office (n=400 total n=800) into a passive observation group which will allow us to determine the extent to which the intervention diffuses more broadly for unexposed patients. Our central hypothesis is that a centralized CVRS managed by clinical pharmacists will be implemented and significantly improve CVD guideline adherence using the Guideline Advantage metrics. The rationale for this proposed study is that implementation of a novel strategy to improve secondary prevention of CVD will lead to innovative strategies for broader adoption by health systems throughout the US. We will accomplish our objectives and test our central hypothesis with the following specific aims:  Our primary Aim is: To determine if a web-based CVRS managed by clinical pharmacists will be implemented within diverse primary care offices. We postulate that adherence to guidelines for secondary prevention of CVD will be significantly greater in patients from clinics randomized to the centralized CVRS group compared to the control group.  This study is expected to produce the following outcomes: guideline adherence will be 40% at baseline and increase to at least 60% in the intervention group at 12 months. We expect guideline adherence will deteriorate after the intervention is discontinued but will remain significantly higher than the control group.","Address;Adherence;Adoption;African American;Ambulatory Care;American;Attitude;Belief;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Caring;Cessation of life;Clinic;Clinical Pharmacists;Cluster randomized trial;Control Groups;Cost Effectiveness Analysis;Diffuse;Disease Management;Enrollment;Event;Goals;Guideline Adherence;Guidelines;Health;Health system;Home environment;Intervention;Lead;Literature;Managed Care;Medical;Meta-Analysis;Modeling;Myocardial Infarction;Online Systems;Outcome;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacists;Physicians;Prevention trial;Primary Health Care;Provider;Randomized;Research;Risk Factors;Secondary Prevention;Self Management;Services;Testing;Underrepresented Minority;United States;Visit;base;cardiovascular disorder prevention;cardiovascular risk factor;care delivery;care systems;cost;cost effectiveness;effective care management;ethnic diversity;group intervention;health record;improved;innovation;mortality;novel strategies;patient oriented;prevent;racial diversity;racial minority;social norm;stroke;treatment as usual;treatment strategy","MEDication Focused Outpatient Care for Underutilization of Secondary Prevention","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Risk factors for cardiovascular disease are poorly controlled even for subjects who frequently visit their physician.

"Aging; Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease is a major cause of mortality and disability in the United States and worldwide and accounts for rising health costs. Clinically it is evident that plaque rupture the most important cause of coronary thrombosis is often associated with myocardial infarction and death. Many of the endogenous ligands that play a key role in plaque rupture are still not well understood. A variant of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin containing the alternatively-spliced extra domain A (EDA+-FN) is absent in healthy arteries but expressed in the atherosclerotic arteries of humans suggesting a role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Our recent study using a specific inhibitor suggests that EDA+-FN aggravates ischemia/reperfusion brain injury via toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway. Together these findings provide a compelling rationale to test the novel role of EDA+-FN and TLR4 signaling in modulating early and advanced atherosclerosis. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that EDA+-FN exacerbates early atherosclerosis via TLR4 signaling in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. Further we will define the role of endothelial cell TLR4 in exacerbating early atherosclerosis. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that TLR4 signaling contributes to plaque vulnerability during advanced atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice. Further we will test the hypothesis that EDA+-FN promotes plaque vulnerability via TLR4 signaling. In Aim 3 we will define the role of endothelial cell EDA+-FN in atherosclerosis. As a preclinical approach we will test the hypothesis that blocking EDA+-FN with monoclonal antibodies will inhibit atherosclerotic lesion progression in ApoE-/- mice. The proposed studies will use multidisciplinary innovative approaches including several novel genetic mouse strains and a novel intravital method to define the mechanisms by which EDA+-FN modulates atherosclerosis. The proposal is significant and may have important clinical implications because the studies designed herein will identify a novel endogenous ligand and unravel new pathway that modulate key atherogenic events in early and advance lesion development.","Accounting;Age;Aorta;Apolipoprotein E;Arterial Fatty Streak;Arteries;Atherosclerosis;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Brain Injuries;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Clinical;Coronary Arteriosclerosis;Coronary Thrombosis;Development;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Event;Extracellular Matrix;Extracellular Matrix Proteins;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fibronectins;Functional disorder;Genetic;Health;Health Care Costs;Histology;Human;Immunohistochemistry;Infiltration;Ischemia;Knockout Mice;Lesion;Ligands;LoxP-flanked allele;Methods;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mouse Strains;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Myocardial Infarction;Necrosis;Pathway interactions;Pilot Projects;Plasma;Play;Prevention;RNA Splicing;Reperfusion Therapy;Research;Research Design;Role;Rupture;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;TEK gene;TLR4 gene;Testing;Tissues;United States;Unstable angina;Valsalva sinus;Variant;disability;feeding;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;macrophage;mortality;multidisciplinary;novel;pre-clinical;research study;western diet","Mechanisms of Fibronectin Extra Domain A in Atherosclerosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The most common cause of coronary artery disease is the development of atherosclerotic plaques and their rupture which is often associated with myocardial infarction and death.

"Biotechnology; Genetics","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-translational modifications of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) are essential for maintaining genome stability. PCNA ubiquitylation facilitates translesion synthesis of damaged DNA templates and PCNA SUMOylation prevents aberrant recombination. This proposal focuses on understanding the protein interactions regulated by post-translational modifications of PCNA and how these interactions modulate translesion synthesis and recombination. The proposed studies are possible because of a highly innovative technological development made by our group which allows for the production of large quantities of modified PCNA using a split/fusion strategy. Using this approach we determined the X-ray crystal structures of both ubiquitin-modified PCNA (Ubi-PCNA) and SUMO-modified PCNA (SUMO-PCNA). Aim 1 is to study the interaction and regulation of target proteins by Ubi-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA. Modified PCNA will be analyzed in single-molecule binding and reconstituted enzyme assays. These studies will test the tool belt model of PCNA action. Aim 2 is to study the structure and dynamics of Ubi-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA. Structural studies will determine the dynamics of modified PCNA and test the hypothesis that dynamic protein-protein partner complexes are critical for regulation. Studies will also determine how post-translational modification of PCNA effects interactions with anti-recombinogenic helicases and modulates recombination. Aim 3 is to study the regulation of DNA synthesis and recombination by Ubi-PCNA and SUMO-PCNA. The split/fusion methodology allows expression of constitutively modified PCNA in cells. This allows in vivo analysis of the effects of ubiquitylated and SUMOylated PCNA. These studies will provide a clear understanding of exactly how PCNA recruits proteins to replication forks how the activities of different proteins bound to PCNA are regulated and coordinated how the hand-off between different proteins occurs on PCNA during multi-step processes and how post-translational modifications of PCNA have such different effects on these processes.","Back;Binding;Binding Proteins;Binding Sites;Biological Assay;Bypass;Cells;Complex;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA biosynthesis;DNA replication fork;Development;Enzymes;Event;Face;Failure;Genetic Recombination;Genetic study;Genome Stability;Genomic Instability;Hand;Health;Human;In Vitro;Lead;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Molecular Conformation;Mutagenesis;Pathway interactions;Polymerase;Positioning Attribute;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Process;Production;Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen;Protein Dynamics;Proteins;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Roentgen Rays;Shapes;Slide;Structure;Surface;Testing;Time;Ubiquitin;Work;base;carcinogenesis;coping;enzyme activity;flexibility;helicase;in vivo;innovation;insight;molecular dynamics;mutant;novel;prevent;recombinational repair;reconstitution;repaired;research study;single molecule;tool;yeast genetics","SUMOylation and ubiquitylation of PCNA in recombination and translesion synthesis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genomic instability drives carcinogenesis.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH & ENGAGEMENT CORE 11.1 GOALS AND OBJECTIVES The goals of the Community Outreach and Education Core (COEC) are to: 1) promote environmental health in rural Midwestern communities and other vulnerable populations; 2) translate environmental health research results into knowledge for our community members; and 3) deliver appropriate science and technology-based information. We intend to achieve these goals through the following four Objectives:  Objective 1) Revitalize and enhance an organizational structure that ensures bi-directional communication and interaction with stakeholders through the re-establishment and further development of the Stakeholders Advisory Board. Objective 2) Increase awareness and understanding of existing and emerging environmental health issues among community citizens professionals and legislators in the Midwest. Objective 3) Respond appropriately to environmental health emergencies when they arise and serve as a conduit for dissemination of educational materials through formal and social media outlets and websites. Objective 4) Evaluate progress towards these objectives through both process and outcome evaluations.  11.2 RELATION OF COEC TO OVERALL CENTER The COEC has been and will continue to be an integral part of the overall center activities. The proposed COEC activities here are developed around 1) fostering bi-directional communication with stakeholder and constituent populations with guidance of the Stakeholder Advisory Board 2) disseminating findings of the core research areas and strengths of the Center around adverse health effects of environmental contaminants among rural and agricultural populations (e.g. organic dust exposure and lung disease pesticide exposure and cancer rural childhood asthma community health problems arising from industrialized livestock production). Dissemination and translation activities will be based on the research of the Center's 60 members many of whom have previously been engaged in COEC activities. The COEC will involve the active participation of Center experts at presentations policy briefings and community forums; as well as for technical reviews of all materials such as fact sheets developed by the COEC staff. As described in Strategic Vision to ensure Center researcher participation in COEC activities the following structures will be in place 1) Strategic areas for outreach will be discussed at Center Retreats and Internal Advisory Committee Meetings; 2) Dr. Parker as COEC leader will serve on the Internal Advisory Committee allowing her to both report on COEC activities as well as learn about new research findings to be disseminated; 3) Dr. Thorne Center Director will serve as COEC Co-Director and will be actively engaged in all COEC leadership and Stakeholder Advisory Board meetings thus providing another avenue for Center-COEC communication.","Advisory Committees;Agriculture;Area;Awareness;Childhood Asthma;Communication;Communities;Community Health;Community Health Education;Community Outreach;Development;Dust;Education;Educational Materials;Emergency Situation;Ensure;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollution;Evaluation;Fostering;Goals;Health;Knowledge;Leadership;Learning;Livestock;Lung diseases;Malignant Neoplasms;Midwestern United States;Outcome;Policies;Population;Process;Production;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Rural;Science;Structure;Technology;Translating;Translations;Vision;Vulnerable Populations;base;health science research;meetings;member;organizational structure;outreach;pesticide exposure;social media;web site","Community Outreach and Education Core","n/a","NIEHS","9040173","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5435","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","145605"," ","131955","66874"," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","10 PILOT GRANT PROGRAM 10.1 GOALS AND SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Pilot Grant Program has been a highly valued component of the EHSRC serving the research career development and training missions of the Center. The Pilot Grant Program has helped advance the careers of talented junior investigators by bringing them into environmental health science (EHS) research. It has fostered innovation and nurtured novel ideas fueling further grant support and publication (Please see Appendix B). The EHSRC will devote $218000 per year to the pilot grant program from Center funds. However at the initiative of the EHSRC additional funds $60000 - $90000 per year will be available from the Office of the Vice President for Research (through the Biological Sciences Program) to support EHS pilot grants. Also this year a new initiative was begun with the Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) Pilot Grant Program to support one $50000 EHS-related pilot grant. The Biological Sciences Program and the ICTS Pilot Grant Program are independently administered providing at least three independent mechanisms for funding research initiatives especially for junior scientists in the field of EHS.  The Goals of the EHSRC Pilot Grant Program are to:  Provide initial support for junior investigators to establish new lines of environmental health research  Provide services of state-of-the-art facilities to pilot grant investigators to enhance their research and reduce their costs  Facilitate exploration of innovative new directions in environmental health for established investigators  Stimulate investigators from other disciplines to apply their expertise to environmental health research  Foster new interdisciplinary collaborations through awarding of pilot projects to investigators who have not previously worked together  The objective measures of the success of the program are:  Grants and contracts developed as progeny of pilot grants  Manuscripts emanating from the pilot grant support  Students mentored and M.S. theses and Ph.D. dissertations generated through pilot grant support  Post-doctoral fellows mentored in research and grantsmanship through the Pilot Grant Program  New interdisciplinary collaborations established as a result of the program  Career development and advancement for faculty in EHS  The pilot grant program has been extremely successful in meeting these objectives. As shown in Table 10.1 the EHSRC has funded 122 pilot grants since it was inaugurated in 1990 (Please see Appendix B). These have been in two categories the Research Pilots where research was carried out in the U.S. and International Pilots where the focus was studies abroad. There have been 106 projects funded through the Research Pilot Grant Program and 16 through the International Pilot Grant Program. Table 10.1 provides data demonstrating the success rate for pilot grant submissions a 58% success rate for Research Pilot Grant applications and 55% for International Pilot applications. In the current grant cycle (2007 - present) 24 pilot grants were funded of which only one was an International Pilot Grant (Table E.I). Nearly all funded pilot grants were projects involving junior investigators and the majority of awards having been awarded to junior principal investigators.  Since 2003 there has been only one International Pilot Grant funded. This low application/funding rate reflects a shift in the focus of our NIH-funded Center for International Rural and Environmental Health. Therefore in the next funding cycle we will fold the International pilots into the regular funding mechanism and discontinue this grant category.  Since the founding of the EHSRC investments in the Pilot Grant Programs ($2157417) have produced grant progeny with a value of $47939311 a more than 22-fold return on investment (please see Appendix B). This success has no doubt been at least partially responsible for the newer partnerships with the Biological Sciences Program and the ICTS program.","Applications Grants;Award;Biological Sciences;Career Mobility;Categories;Clinical;Clinical Sciences;Contracts;Data;Discipline;Doctor of Philosophy;Environmental Health;Faculty;Fostering;Funding;Funding Mechanisms;Goals;Grant;Institutes;International;Investments;Manuscripts;Measures;Mentors;Mission;Pilot Projects;Postdoctoral Fellow;Principal Investigator;Publications;Research;Research Personnel;Rural Health;Scientist;Services;Training;Translational Research;Uncertainty;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;career;career development;cost;health science research;innovation;interdisciplinary collaboration;international center;meetings;novel;programs;student mentoring;success","Pilot Project Program","n/a","NIEHS","9040172","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5434","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","329179"," ","253527","128876"," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","6 ADMINISTRATIVE CORE 6.1 GOAL AND AIMS The goal of the Administrative Core is to support the EHSRC in achieving its vision and aims by the coordination integration and assessment of Center cores facilities membership activities and budgets. The specific aims of the Administrative Core are to:  Aim 1) Provide direction and leadership to promote the vision goals and aims of the Center; Aim 2) Provide interdisciplinary coordination and foster interactions between Center members research cores and facilities; Aim 3) Administer the Pilot Grant Program Career Development Program and Director's Fund; Aim 4) Promote environmental health outreach through administrative support of COEC; Aim 5) Assess and document the productivity and effectiveness of Center activities; Aim 6) Foster interactions with NIEHS Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) Centers elsewhere and with other EHS organizations; and Aim 7) Leverage institutional resources for the Center.  The Administrative Core plays a central role under the guidance of the Internal and External Advisory Committees. The Administrative Core interacts with all Research Cores Facility Cores the COEC and the NIEHS Division of Extramural Research and Training (DERT) to foster interactions and advance the goals and aims of the Center as well as those of NIEHS. The Administrative Core provides assessment of the productivity and effectiveness of EHSRC components and determines the appropriateness of Center activities. The Core is responsible for the submission and management of competing non-competing and supplemental grant proposals. The Core also responds to inquiries from NIEHS the University or the College of Public Health regarding activities of the EHSRC and connects the Research Cores with COEC Activities.  6.7 DIRECTOR'S FUND A Director's Fund has been added by NIEHS as an option to the Core Centers program since our last competitive renewal. In this renewal application we have elected to institute a Director's Fund budgeted at $50000/year. This fund will be under the purview of the IAC with final decisions made by the Center Director in consultation with the Deputy Director. Effectiveness of the Director's Fund allocations will be monitored by the Center Deputy Director and reviewed annually by the Internal and the External Advisory Committees. Anticipated uses of the Director's Fund include:  1) timely response to emerging environmental health issues or disasters; 2) purchase or replacement of a device essential to center facility operations: and 3) development of new technology identified as important to advancing center goals.  We expected to allocate the Director's Funds for special projects that respond to an environmental disaster or a unique environmental health issue requiring a rapid response. Examples include devastating floods such as the Iowa Floods of 2008 large scale hazardous substance spills or explosions that pose a risk to public health. The Director's Fund may also be used to purchase or replace a key piece of Facility Core equipment the need for which could not have been anticipated in the regular budgeting process (e.g. premature failure of a major piece of equipment or the identification of a new technology that would be of great benefit to the Center).","Advisory Committees;Applications Grants;Budgets;Consultations;Core Facility;Decision Making;Development;Devices;Disasters;Effectiveness;Environmental Health;Equipment;Explosion;Extramural Activities;Failure;Floods;Fostering;Funding;Goals;Grant;Hazardous Substances;Institutes;Iowa;Leadership;Monitor;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;Play;Process;Productivity;Public Health;Research;Research Training;Resources;Risk;Role;Universities;Vision;career development;college;health science research;member;new technology;operation;outreach;premature;programs;response","Administrative Core (includes review of Director's Fund)","n/a","NIEHS","9040171","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5433","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","285739"," ","224759","114204"," "," ",
"Clinical Research; Complementary and Alternative Medicine","9.1.2 Rationale for Goals and Aims The IHSF is a central component of the EHSRC promoting human-centered research. An emphasis on human studies has been a long-standing strength of the EHSRC; this facility provides the infrastructure to conduct such studies with safety (to both research subjects and investigators) reproducibility and rigorous scientific approaches. The IHSF supports radiological imaging bronchoscopies and other services needed to translate basic investigations into clinical studies.  A significant change in the IHSF since our previous application has been driven by the awarding of a Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) to the U.I. ICTS. This development has led to a significant (over $10 million) investment by the University into research infrastructure and facilities from which our EHSRC investigators can benefit. Although the ICST provides outstanding facilities available for human research its strengths are centered on subject interactions; the IHSF provides support in specific research modalities including human exposures enhanced pulmonary function testing bronchoscopy and imaging for EHS-related research. We have enhanced the Center services to ensure that EHSRC researchers are able to maximize the potential for translational environmental health science research. Being able to access both ICTS resources as well as EHSRC facilities is a great opportunity for center investigators. We will support investigators using these state-of-the-art facilities by enhanced study design IRB support measurements biological sampling. and specimen analyses. Furthermore we will subsidize the costs of using the ICTS facilities. The University of Iowa ICST has initiated a policy of recharges for all studies. This is gradated by funding source so that industry-initiated industry-sponsored trials are charged the actual cost of providing services (including protocol review document preparation clinical services etc) and NIH-funded studies are charged discounted fees generally by 50%. Because we recognize that this cost-shifting will provide a barrier for new and non-funded investigators; to support our investigators we propose to cover a substantial portion of this ""co-pay"" for EHSRC members. We propose to fully cover (up to a maximum of $5000/study) the ICTS charge-backs for EHSRC Pilot Grant recipients and K-awardees and cover half of these costs (up to a maximum of $2500/study) for other EHSRC investigators whose projects are within the purview of our EHSRC.","Acute;Aerosols;Award;Back;Biological;Bronchoscopy;Charge;Clinical;Clinical Investigator;Clinical Research;Clinical Sciences;Clinical Services;Collaborations;Cover-up;Development;Disease;Ensure;Environment;Environmental Exposure;Environmental Health;Exposure to;Fees;Funding;Funding Agency;Gases;Goals;Grant;Health;Health Sciences;Human;Image;Industry;Institutes;Institutional Review Boards;Integrative Medicine;Interdisciplinary Study;Investigation;Investments;Iowa;Lung;Measurement;Modality;Monitor;Physiological;Policies;Preparation;Process;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary function tests;Recruitment Activity;Reproducibility;Research;Research Design;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Research Subjects;Resources;Safety;Sampling;Services;Specimen;Training;Training and Infrastructure;Translating;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;cost;cost shifting;discount;experience;exposed human population;health science research;human subject;injured airway;interdisciplinary collaboration;interest;member;multidisciplinary;patient oriented;research facility;research study;response;response to injury;translational study","Integrative Health Sciences Core","n/a","NIEHS","9040170","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5432","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","218655"," ","180332","91547"," "," ",

"No NIH Category available","The EHSRC has a longstanding history of fostering the careers of researchers at all levels in the environmentalhealth sciences. Building on this track record the EHSRC will continue training future leaders in EHS byaddressing the following major objectives: Recruitment and support of talented junior investigators (named Associate Members) committed to EHSresearch by providing salary and research support facility access and mentoring by senior members. Recruitment of faculty at all levels with expertise and research interests important to EHSRC development. Enrichment of all Center investigators with seminars workshops center retreats interactions with visitingprofessors support of local conferences and inter-center exchanges to foster cutting edge multidisciplinaryresearch and research translation.In the next funding cycle the Career Development Program (CDP) in close interaction with the InternalAdvisory Committee will continue to play an essential role in identifying and recruiting investigators new to thefield of EHS or working in emerging areas of EHS (e.g. the effect of climate change on environmental health inthe rural Midwest). The ultimate goal is to promote an increased understanding of environmental contaminantsand to reduce their impacts on human health by training the future leaders in EHS.To achieve these objectives the following components of the CDP provide development activities throughoutall career development stages beginning with junior all the way to senior Center members: 1) The EHSRCselects promising junior investigators with an interest in EHS as Associate Members (4.4.1). 2) AssociateMembers are asked to identify a mentoring committee and put forth a development plan that contains allelements required for NIH-funded career development awards (4.4.2). 3) The career development progress ofall mentored Center members is evaluated annually (4.4.3). 4) As members progress to more independentstatus the EHSRC sponsors a range of enrichment activities to stimulate EHS research and provide access tounique research facilities (4.4.4.). 5) To ensure that the CDP meets its objective vigorous evaluation will beperformed by the Internal (lAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) (4.5).","Address;Advisory Committees;Area;Development;Development Plans;Educational workshop;Elements;Ensure;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollution;Evaluation;Facility Accesses;Faculty Recruitment;Fostering;Funding;Future;Goals;Human;Interdisciplinary Study;K-Series Research Career Programs;Mentors;Midwestern United States;Names;Play;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Research Support;Role;Rural;Staging;Training;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Visit;Wages;Work;career;career development;climate change;health science research;health training;interest;meetings;member;professor;programs;research facility;symposium","Career Development Program","n/a","NIEHS","9040168","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5430","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","105701"," ","105528","53397"," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","5 INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT The University of Iowa (U.I.) has repeatedly demonstrated the value it places on the EHSRC supporting the Center with new and renovated facilities new faculty lines and funding for outreach activities and doctoral trainees. The University has specifically highlighted the EHSRC in their strategic plan and in documents and publications sent to the Legislature the Board of Regents U.I. alumni and the mass media. In support of this competitive renewal the U.I. has committed salary and start-up costs for four new faculty lines new equipment in the amount of $83000 for facility cores five doctoral student research assistantships valued at over $800000 over 5 yrs offices and meeting space for the EHSRC in a new LEED Gold sustainable building $50000 in facility operating funds $67000 in facility core renovation $50000 per year to augment the Pilot Grant Program and subsidized access to Holden Cancer Center-sponsored facility cores. This support plus that received in the current cycle is detailed below.  Dr. Thorne has been on the faculty of the U.I. for 23 years with appointments in the Colleges of Medicine (primary 1988-1999) Public Health (primary 1999-present) and Engineering (secondary). During this time he has established a reputation as a scientific administrator capable of building and sustaining successful programs. U.I. administration is satisfied that past institutional support for the EHSRC has been put to good use and has yielded a substantial return on their investment. While the last five years have been a very challenging time for public universities the U.I. has maintained its support for the Center. State appropriations to the U.I. declined from $311.8M in 2008 to $235.5M in 2010. However the grants and contracts garnered by U.I. investigators increased significantly from $366.4M in 2006 to $466.5M last year. The U.I. is ranked 13th for NIH funding among all public universities and commits considerable resources to foster strong interdisciplinary research with the research Centers playing a key role in that infrastructure. The U.I. has supported the EHSRC in innovative ways including providing support for new faculty lines core facilities laboratory renovation projects pilot grants graduate student stipends and continuing support for affiliated centers and programs.","Administrator;Appointment;Assistantship;Cancer Center;Cell Respiration;Contracts;Core Facility;Engineering;Environmental Health;Equipment;Faculty;Fostering;Funding;Gold;Grant;Interdisciplinary Study;Investments;Iowa;Laboratories;Mass Media;Medicine;Oxidative Stress;Pilot Projects;Play;Public Health;Publications;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Strategic Planning;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Wages;college;cost;doctoral student;graduate student;health science research;innovation;meetings;outreach;programs","Oxidative Stress and Metabolism Research Core","n/a","NIEHS","9040167","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5429","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","20828"," ","49321","24731"," "," ",

"Climate-Related Exposures and Conditions; Lung; Prevention","1.1 INTRODUCTION AND VISION STATEMENT Since its inception in 1990 Environmental Health Sciences Research Center (EHSRC) at the University of Iowa (U.I.) has advanced and translated research that addresses environmental health problems across the urban-rural continuum. Our early research was focused on organic dust exposure and lung disease pesticide exposure and cancer rural childhood asthma and community health problems arising from industrialized livestock production. While studies in these arenas continue we have also encompassed areas of emerging importance such as nanotoxicology oxidative stress and innate immunity and have applied new innovations in environmental genomics advanced metabolomics environmental intervention cohort studies and state-of-the-art biomedical imaging. As future environmental health issues come to light we will continue to embrace their challenges through vigorous research outreach and community engagement. For example in the wake of the Iowa Flood of 2008 we are investigating environmental health challenges posed by a warmer wetter climate in the Midwest. Data collected in Iowa over the last 114 years show more frost-free days higher annual rainfalls and increasing days each year with extreme rainfall.  Allergenic plants are flowering sooner producing more pollen and expanding their northern range. Farmers are adapting to climate change by planting earlier and at higher densities; using more pesticides to control yield loss from new insects fungi and weeds; and expanding use of subsurface drainage systems that channel pesticides and manure into surface waterways. In this example a changing climate has direct relevance to rural and agricultural populations as well as far-reaching implications for public health along the urban-rural continuum. The EHSRC is translating innovative research on climate change health effects to policy makers and the public to support sound adaptation strategies and to improve our preparedness for environmental disasters with a focus on disease prevention.  EHSRC Vision Statement: The Center vision is to be the primary environmental health resource for improving the health of rural residents by stimulating and translating innovative environmental health sciences research. This will be accomplished by gaining new insights into rural exposures; pathways of host defense lung injury and repair; nanotoxicology; and population health; and then translating these insights to clinical medicine public health practice and regulatory policy.","Address;Agriculture;Angiosperms;Applications Grants;Area;Cell Respiration;Childhood Asthma;Climate;Clinical Medicine;Cohort Studies;Collaborations;Community Health;Community Outreach;Core Facility;Data;Disasters;Drainage procedure;Dust;Educational workshop;Emergency Situation;Environment;Environmental Health;Environmental Pollution;Equipment;Floods;Future;Genomics;Goals;Grant;Health;Health Personnel;Health Resources;Host Defense;Inflammation;Insecta;Iowa;Livestock;Lung;Lung diseases;Malignant Neoplasms;Manure;Mentors;Midwestern United States;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;Natural Immunity;Outreach Research;Oxidative Stress;Paper;Pathway interactions;Pesticides;Physicians;Plants;Policies;Policy Maker;Pollen;Population;Production;Public Health;Public Health Practice;Readiness;Recruitment Activity;Research;Research Personnel;Resources;Rural;Rural Health;Science;Scientist;Surface;System;Techniques;Toxicology;Translating;Translational Research;Universities;Vision;Wages;base;bioimaging;career;career development;climate change;college;density;disorder prevention;environmental intervention;farmer;fungus;health science research;improved;innovation;insight;lung injury;lung repair;meetings;member;metabolomics;nanotoxicology;outreach;outreach program;pesticide exposure;population based;population health;programs;sound","Pulmonary Toxicology Facility Core","n/a","NIEHS","9040164","5/18/2016","RFA-ES-11-001","4P30ES005605-26","4","P30","ES","005605","26","",""," ","4/30/2017","Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee[EHS]","5425","1871732","THORNE, PETER S","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","249062"," ","202158","100129"," "," ",

"Cardiovascular; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to support the career development of Linnea Polgreen PhD. Her long-term goal is to become an independent investigator with a research program focused on developing methods for determining the best treatment options based on observational data. She has assembled a team of experienced mentors including both clinical and quantitative researchers. These mentors not only bring diverse and complementary areas of expertise but also all of them have been successful mentors of students and young faculty. With this team of mentors she will gain insight into what clinical questions she should attempt to answer using quantitative methods and how to answer them.       Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the ""gold standard"" for determining treatment effectiveness RCTs are difficult to perform: they are expensive and slow. In the absence of findings from RCTs observational data are often used to inform treatment decisions. There are a number of strategies available to analyze treatment outcomes using observational data but exactly which strategy is likely to be most accurate is currently unclear. Her objective in this application is to develop a general framework using methods from economics epidemiology and computer science and outcome-based observational data to determine treatment effectiveness for medical interventions in general. Specifically she will use Medicare Part A B and D data from a cohort of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) to prevent subsequent AMIs followed 1 year prior to and up to 4 years post the index AMI. For Aim 1 she will identify the approach that most accurately reflects ACE inhibitor/ARB outcomes as given by previous RCTs. For Aim 2 she will identify the approach that most accurately estimates treatment effectiveness for patients not generally eligible for RCTs.       Upon successful completion of these aims she expects to have developed a framework for identifying the advantages and disadvantages of different methods for estimating treatment effectiveness using observational data for a broad range of cardiac and pulmonary diseases.","Acute myocardial infarction;Angiotensin II Receptor;Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors;Angiotensins;Area;Award;Chronic Disease;Clinical;Clinical Medicine;Communication;Comorbidity;Computerized Medical Record;Computers;Data;Data Analytics;Disadvantaged;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Economics;Effectiveness;Elderly;Enrollment;Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs;Enzyme Inhibitors;Epidemiologist;Epidemiology;Explosion;Faculty;Funding;Goals;Gold;Health;Heart Diseases;Intervention;Learning;Lung diseases;Medical;Medicare Part A;Mentors;Methods;Morbidity - disease rate;Outcome;Patient Care;Patients;Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A;Persons;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Rare Diseases;Recommendation;Recurrence;Research;Research Personnel;Scientist;Time;Training;Treatment Effectiveness;Treatment outcome;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;base;career development;cohort;computer science;cost effective;experience;improved;indexing;insight;meetings;mortality;prevent;programs;student mentoring;trial design","Observational data and treatment effectiveness: which methods work best?","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the ""gold standard"" for determining treatment effectiveness they are very expensive and time-consuming to perform and for rare diseases RCTs are even more difficult to organize and complete.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss and blindness. Current treatments of POAG are aimed at reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) the most important risk factor for the development and progression of the disorder. However current glaucoma treatments do not address the underlying disease mechanisms. Mutations in the myocilin gene (MYOC) are the most common known genetic cause of glaucoma. Three developments provide us with an opportunity to investigate novel treatments of glaucoma directed at the underlying disease mechanisms: 1. The development of a POAG mouse model (Tg- MYOCY437H) in our laboratory that expresses mutant myocilin encoded by the MYOC gene; 2. The use of the Tg-MYOCY437H mouse model to demonstrate in vivo that mutant myocilin accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress in the trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye as a key mechanistic component leading to glaucoma; and 3. The recent development of genome editing nucleases as a valuable tool for gene therapy applications. Furthermore the fact that myocilin-associated POAG results from dominant gain of function mutations and the fact that ER stress induced apoptosis in the TM leads to POAG provide an opportunity to explore novel glaucoma treatments by in vivo elimination of mutant MYOC and/or apoptosis pathway genes (e.g. Chop). We propose to utilize the Tg-MYOCY437H mouse model of glaucoma to further explore the role of ER stress in POAG and to use a novel genome editing method (CRISPR) to explore novel POAG treatments specifically the elimination of mutant myocilin from the TM of Tg-MYOCY437H mice as well as the elimination of ER stress genes from TM cells. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) is an endogenous nuclease system which uses RNA sequences to guide the cleavage of DNA by the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9. In addition we will explore the role of ER stress in steroid induced glaucoma for the purpose of determining whether the genome editing strategy of glaucoma treatment can be applied to this form of glaucoma. Importantly we will extend our work to humans by exploring the utility of genome editing in a human eye perfusion organ culture system. We believe that Cas9 can be used to remove the mutant MYOC gene and provide the first effective cure for MYOC mutation-induced glaucoma. In addition the eye is an ideal test site for establishing the therapeutic potential of the Cas9 technology and this work will pave the path for the application of Cas9 for treating a variety of genetic eye disorders as well disorders affecting other organ systems.","Address;Affect;Anterior;Apoptosis;Aqueous Humor;Blindness;Cell Death;Cells;Chronic;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;DNA;DNA Sequence Alteration;Development;Dexamethasone;Diagnosis;Disease;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Event;Eye;Eye diseases;Failure;Functional disorder;Gene Mutation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Genetic;Glaucoma;Goals;Health;Human;Laboratories;Lead;Light;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Modality;Modeling;Molecular Chaperones;Mus;Mutation;Ocular Hypertension;Organ Culture Techniques;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Perfusion;Phenotype;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Play;Primary Open Angle Glaucoma;Proteins;RNA Sequences;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Risk Factors;Role;Signaling Protein;Site;Steroids;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Trabecular meshwork structure;Transgenic Mice;Work;axonal degeneration;base;body system;common treatment;endoplasmic reticulum stress;gain of function mutation;gene function;gene therapy;genetic risk assessment;genome editing;improved;in vivo;insight;mouse model;mutant;myocilin;novel;nuclease;prevent;response;sensor;success;tool;transcription factor","Novel Glaucoma Treatment Using Genome Editing","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The successful completion of this project will lead to insight into the disease mechanisms causing primary open angle glaucoma a major human blinding disorder.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a common disease of the optic nerve that affects over 60 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States. However the biological pathways that lead to glaucoma are not well understood and this has hindered efforts for early detection and treatment of this condition.Consequently there is great need to clarify the causes of glaucoma at the molecular level. We identified a new glaucoma gene TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and discovered that duplication of the TBK1 gene is associated glaucoma. TBK1 has been studied extensively in non-ocular tissues and has well- defined roles in the innate immune system. Activated TBK1 stimulates assembly of a phagosome and engulfment / elimination of bacteria proteins and organelles (a process known as autophagy). Three autophagy genes (TBK1 OPTN and TLR4) encode interacting proteins and have also been described as NTG genes. Moreover autophagy has been implicated in the retinal ganglion cell death in experimental animal models of glaucoma. Our discovery that TBK1 is an NTG gene provides additional evidence that autophagy has an important role in the pathogenesis of NTG. The convergence of data from human genetic studies of NTG and from experimental glaucoma model systems provides strong evidence that autophagy may be a central process in the pathogenesis of retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma. Our central hypothesis is that TBK1 influences autophagy at the key site of pathology in glaucoma the retinal ganglion cells that form the optic nerve. Dysregulation of this pathway (e.g. by duplication of TBK1) may start a cascade of events that leads to apoptosis of the retinal ganglion cells vision loss and glaucoma. We propose to test our hypothesis with three specific aims that use our unique and powerful collection of glaucoma patient cohorts human donor eyes and transgenic TBK1 mice that have the same genetic defect as human patients. We will identify new genes that cause glaucoma by testing large cohorts of glaucoma patients for mutations in autophagy genes using next generation DNA sequencing strategies. We will determine the effect of TBK1 mutation (gene duplication) on the development of glaucoma and activation of autophagy in the retina of transgenic TBK1 mice (which we have made and are ready to study). We will also test drugs that stimulate or block autophagy for their ability to prevent glaucoma in these mice. We will investigate the pathway(s) by which TBK1 defects lead to glaucoma by identifying interacting proteins in the retina. With these experiments we will begin to characterize the biological pathway by which defects in the TBK1 gene lead to glaucoma validate an animal model of glaucoma and begin to translate our discoveries into new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of disease.","Affect;African American;American;Animal Model;Animals;Apoptosis;Asians;Attention;Autophagocytosis;Bacteria;Biochemical Pathway;Biological;Biological Models;Biological Process;Blindness;Candidate Disease Gene;Caucasians;Cell Death;Clinic;Collection;DNA;DNA Sequence;Data;Defect;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Early treatment;Event;Exons;Experimental Animal Model;Eye;Gene Duplication;Genes;Genetic study;Glaucoma;Goals;Health;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Human;Human Genetics;Immune system;Intervention;Lead;Link;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Optic Nerve;Organelles;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phagosomes;Phenotype;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Research;Retina;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Risk Factors;Role;Series;Site;Surveys;TANK-binding kinase 1;TLR4 gene;Testing;Time;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Translating;United States;Vision;Visual;base;cohort;disability;drug testing;genetic approach;glaucoma test;improved;information gathering;inhibitor/antagonist;insight;mouse model;mutant;next generation;next generation sequencing;novel;novel strategies;optic nerve disorder;outcome forecast;patient population;pressure;prevent;programs;research study","Molecular Genetics of Norma Tension Glaucoma","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recently we discovered that defects in the gene TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) can cause glaucoma a common optic nerve disease that is a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States.

"Genetics","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human birth defects and cancers are often caused by misregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. In early vertebrate embryos development of the body axis critically requires the activation of the Wnt pathway on one side of the embryo. In the frog Xenopus a predominant model organism for axis formation asymmetric Wnt signaling is achieved by the differential localization of maternally derived molecules stored in the egg. These determinants are translocated toward the future dorsal side by microtubule-based rotational movements of the egg cortex following fertilization. Interference with this process results in embryos lacking the dorsal tissues. The exact mechanisms regulating asymmetry in cortical rotation and Wnt activation in axis formation remain unclear. Data from maternal loss-of- function studies including preliminary studies for this proposal have implicated vegetally localized factors. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the role of these localizedmaternal gene products in embryonic axis formation. Preliminary studies for this proposal have identified a potential for maternal Wnt signals in regulating cortical rotation. Novel methods for monitoring microtubule dynamics during cortical rotation in vivo are also employed. The objectives of this proposal are to determine mechanisms underlying the formation of the vegetal microtubule array and to characterize potential determinants carried on the array. The specific aims are to determine the roles of localized mRNAs in controlling microtubule assembly during the cortical rotation to determine the extent this process is regulated by ongoing Wnt signaling in the oocyte and to characterize protein determinants in the vegetal cortex.","Address;Animal Model;Antisense Oligonucleotides;Cell Cycle;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Polarity;Childhood;Congenital Abnormality;Cytoplasm;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Dorsal;Embryo;Embryonic Development;Feedback;Fertilization;Funding;Future;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Epistasis;Goals;Grant;Health;Hereditary Disease;Human;Human Development;Image;Life;Ligands;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Methodology;Methods;Microtubule Polymerization;Microtubules;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Evolution;Monitor;Motion;Movement;Oocytes;Organism;Pathway interactions;Play;Plus End of the Microtubule;Prevention;Process;Proteins;Proteomics;Public Health;Publishing;Rana;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Research;Role;Rotation;Side;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Structure;TPT1 gene;Techniques;Testing;Tissue Differentiation;Tissues;Work;Xenopus;base;cell type;egg;gene product;improved;in vivo;insight;loss of function;novel;receptor;research study;success;ubiquitin ligase;vertebrate embryos","Localized determinants in vertebrate axis formation","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The findings of these proposed studies are relevant to and will benefit public health by enhancing the understanding of basic signaling pathways involved in cell and tissue differentiation which are conserved in human development.

"Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases; Spinal Muscular Atrophy","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Humans have two nearly identical copies of Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) gene SMN1 and SMN2.  Low SMN levels due to deletion and/or mutation of SMN1 lead to spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) a major genetic cause of infant mortality.  SMN2 fails to compensate for the loss of SMN1 due to a C to T mutation at the 6th position (C6U in transcript) in exon 7.  C6U weakens the 32-splice site and triggers SMN2 exon 7 skipping resulting in synthesis of a truncated protein (SMN7) which is unstable.  It is known that strategies aimed at correction of SMN2 exon 7 splicing hold the promise for a cure.  This proposal emanates from our recent discovery of a unique RNA structure formed by a long-distance interaction (LDI) as a regulator of SMN2 exon 7 splicing (Singh et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 doi:10.1093/nar/gkt609).  We call this structure internal stem through LDI-1 (ISTL1).  Employing the SHAPE (Selective 22-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) method we confirmed the formation and functional significance of ISTL1.  We showed that an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated sequestration of the 32 strand of ISTL1 fully corrects SMN2 exon 7 splicing and restores high levels of SMN and Gemin2 an SMN-interacting protein in SMA patient cells.  Our results also revealed that the 32 strand of ISTL1 is located within a largeinhibitory region that we termed intronic splicing silencer N2 (ISS-N2).  To continue with our lead here we propose to characterize additional (novel) intronic cis-elements and their cognate transacting factors in regulation of SMN2 exon 7 splicing.  A part of the proposal is aimed at validating the therapeutic efficacy of ISS-N2- targeting ASOs.  In Aim 1 we will use overlapping deletions ASO-based strategies and SHAPE analyses to determine the significance of novel cis-elements within SMN2 intron 7.  We will validate our findings in different cell types includingmotor neuron-like NSC34 cells.  We will examine the effect of a larger structural context on the accessibility of the splice sites of SMN2 exon 7.  We will determine whether SMN2-specific mutations lead to a structural difference between SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNAs particularly at the splice sites of SMN exon 7.  In addition we will evaluate whether critical cis-elements withinintron 6 affect the structural context of intron 7 and potentially lead to the remodeling of the 52slice site of exon 7.  In Aim 2 we will employ over-expression and siRNA-based strategies to identify splicing factors that assist ISTL1 formation and/or use ISTL1 as a site for self-recruitment.  We will use a biotinylated oligonucleotide as a trapping device to capture novel RNA-protein complexes that are deposited on SMN2 intron 7 and are critical for the inhibitory effect of LDI.  We have previously shown that TIA1 stimulates SMN2 exon 7 splicing by binding to intron 7.  We also demonstrated critical role of the Q-rich domain of TIA1 in regulation of SMN2 exon 7 splicing.  Recently a point mutation within Q-rich domain of TIA1 has been shown to cause Welander distal myopathy as well as promote SMN2 exon 7 skipping.  Based on these findings and our preliminary results we will examine the role of another Q-rich domain containing splicing regulator SFPQ in SMN2 exon 7 splicing.  We will employ UV-crosslinking footprinting in vitro binding and SHAPE-based approaches to characterize RNA-protein interactions.

"Autism; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Comparative Effectiveness Research; Cost Effectiveness Research; Health Services; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Networking and Information Technology R&D; Pediatric; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Managing challenging behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) can profoundly improve quality of life for children and families. However many families lack access to research-based treatment such as applied behavior analysis (ABA). This study is a randomized trial comparing outcomes of treatment for ASD using either a standard Functional Analysis Plus Functional Communication Training (FA+FCT) package or a pragmatic version that offers a briefer less time-intensive model of FA+FCT. Both types of FA+FCT are provided via telehealth in family homes to maximize generalizability to real-life settings. Providing ABA through telehealth makes an effective treatment accessible across geographic barriers so that no child is excluded based on where they live. The study also examines key family factors that influence successful outcomes. Objectives: The main objective of this study is to determine the most efficient way for families to reduce problem behavior in their children with autism. The study has 3 primary aims: (1) To assess outcomes for ABA telehealth by assigning children to either a Pragmatic FA+FCT group or to a group receiving Standard FA+FCT. Outcomes will be compared based on the percent reduction in problem behavior communication increases time to achieve outcomes treatment fidelity family acceptance of treatment and generalization and maintenance of treatment gains. (2) The study will assess the relation of family factors to treatment efficacy and acceptability by assessing parent stress mood and social support in relation to outcomes. (3) Cost effectiveness will be assessed in relation to the treatment methods used and the efficiency of ABA telehealth. Methods: The study will include 102 children who are 18-83 months of age have a confirmed ASD diagnosis and have serious behavior problems requiring treatment. Thirty-six children will receive intervention in each of three states: Iowa Georgia and Texas. Study design is a randomized trial using an intent-to-treat analysis. Half of the sample will be randomized to Pragmatic FA+FCT and half to Standard FA+FCT. Treatment will be provided via telehealth using FCT which is a function-based ABA technique in which parents are trained to be therapists under the direction of behavior consultants. Study procedures typically are completed within 6 months and follow-up assessments occur 6 months after treatment completion. Data analyses include comparisons between assessment groups single-case designs examining responses in individual children cost analyses and regression analyses of the effects of family factors on outcomes. Impact: Our prior research shows that problem behavior can be reduced by over 90% in most children with ASD after 4-6 months of telehealth treatment. If Pragmatic FA+FCT can reduce problem behavior at rates comparable to Standard FA+FCT then treatment can be started sooner and families can achieve successful outcomes at lower cost. Although pragmatic FA+FCT provides less behavioral information it may be more resistant to treatment relapse because it does not involve reinforcing high rates of problem behavior.","Affect;Aftercare;Age-Months;Area;Autistic Disorder;Behavior;Behavior Therapy;Behavior assessment;Behavioral;Caring;Child;Child Care;Child health care;Code;Communication;Consultations;Cost Analysis;Cost Savings;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Diagnosis;Disadvantaged;Distress;Family;Family Relationship;Foundations;Goals;Gold;Health;Healthcare;Home environment;Human Resources;Individual;Inferior;Intervention;Iowa;Lead;Life;Link;Maintenance;Methods;Modeling;Modification;Moods;Outcome;Parents;Phase;Problem behavior;Procedures;Psychological reinforcement;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Randomized;Regression Analysis;Relapse;Research;Research Design;Resistance;Sampling;Services;Shapes;Social support;Stress;Supervision;Techniques;Testing;Texas;Time;Training;Treatment Efficacy;Treatment outcome;autism spectrum disorder;base;behavior change;behavioral health;brief intervention;care systems;cost;cost effective;cost effectiveness;design;effective therapy;evidence base;family support;follow-up;improved;prevent;randomized trial;research based treatment;response;social communication;telehealth;treatment duration;treatment effect;treatment group;trial comparing","Comparing Behavioral Assessments Using Telehealth for Children with Autism","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Access to behavioral treatment for autism is limited by a shortage of trained professionals and a lack of efficient cost-effective methods for providing evidence-based behavioral services in underserved areas. This research is guided by three core principles that form the foundation of initiatives to improve behavioral health care for children with autism: (1) enhancing access to quality care (2) reducing the cost of care and (3) improving the health of children and families. By evaluating the effects of different behavioral assessment methods on treatment outcomes the effects of family support on behavior change and the costs of providing applied behavior analysis through telehealth consultation this study has the potential to change the way in which behavioral services are provided to reduce disruptive behavior and increase social communication in young children with autism spectrum disorders.","NIMH","9038445","2/25/2016","PA-13-216","5R01MH104363-02","5","R01","MH","104363","02","","PINTELLO, DENISE ","4/1/2015","3/31/2019","Interventions Committee for Disorders Involving Children and Their Families[ITVC]"," ","9470345","LINDGREN, SCOTT DAVID","BERG, WENDY K","01","PEDIATRICS","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," ","242","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","603818"," ","NIMH","492636","111182"," ","603818",

"Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Genetics; Hypertension; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive heterogeneous human disorder characterized  by a pleiotropic phenotype including eariy onset obesity hypertension and cardiovascular disease.  Although BBS is a rare Mendelian disorder identifying the underiying mechanisms of the phenotypes  associated with this syndrome has garnered great interest because the pathophysiology of the  phenotypes such as obesity and hypertension in BBS may yield clues to understanding common human  obesity and hypertension. Our preliminary data obtained using a series of novel mouse models that  phenocopy human BBS point to the importance of the neurogenic mechanisms for the metabolic and  cardiovascular dysregulations associated with BBS. Indeed we identified an intrinsic hypothalamic leptin  resistance as a major cause of energy imbalance and obesity in BBS. Our data also indicate that neural  mechanisms play a major pathophysiological role in the hypertension associated with deletion of Bbs  genes in mice. More recently we found that CNS deletion of Bbsl gene (using a novel conditional  Bbsl flox/flox mouse model) recapitulates the obesity phenotype associated with BBS highlighting the  importance of Bbs genes in the central nervous for energy homeostasis. Moreover Bbs-deficiency  causes defects in ER stress and activation of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain. Based on these  findings we hypothesize that Bbs genes in the central nervous system are critical for energy homeostasis  and the autonomic regulation of arterial pressure. We plan to test our central hypothesis by pursuing the  following 3 hypotheses: 1) Neuronal BBS proteins are important for metabolic and cardiovascular  regulation and disruption of the Bbsl gene in specific neuronal populations alters energy homeostasis  autonomic function and arterial pressure; 2) Defects in the brain BBSome receptor trafficking ER stress  and the brain renin-angiotensin system are critically involved in the metabolic autonomic and arterial  pressure alterations associated with BBS; and 3) Haploinsufficiency of Bbs genes increases susceptibility  to obesity autonomic dysfunction and hypertension. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  These studies are significant because they will provide important insight into the role of neuronal Bbs genes and identify new fundamental mechanisms underiying the regulation of metabolic and  cardiovascular functions by Bbs genes in the central nervous system. The novel information gained from these studies will have potential implications for the management of obesity and associated  cardiovascular disorders in BBS as well as in common human obesity.","Affect;Alleles;Autonomic Dysfunction;Bardet-Biedl Syndrome;Body Weight;Brain;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cardiovascular system;Cell physiology;Complex;Data;Defect;Diet;Disease;Eating;Energy Metabolism;Exhibits;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Genetically Engineered Mouse;High Fat Diet;Homeostasis;Human;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;In Vitro;Instruction;Knock-in Mouse;Leptin;Leptin resistance;Macromolecular Complexes;Mendelian disorder;Metabolic;Methods;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Neuraxis;Neurons;Obesity;Pathway interactions;Phenocopy;Phenotype;Physiological;Plasma;Play;Population;Predisposition;Pro-Opiomelanocortin;Proteins;Publishing;Regulation;Renin-Angiotensin System;Reporting;Role;Series;Signal Transduction;Site;Stress;Syndrome;System;Testing;base;blood pressure regulation;feeding;insight;interest;leptin receptor;mouse model;mutant;nestin protein;neuromechanism;novel;obesity management;pressure;protein protein interaction;protein transport;receptor;trafficking","Role of Brain Bardet-Biedl Syndrome Genes in Metabolic and Cardiovas Regulation","n/a","NHLBI","9038409","4/1/2016","PAR-10-285","4P01HL084207-09","4","P01","HL","084207","09","","MARIC-BILKAN, CHRISTINE ","6/1/2007"," ","ZHL1-PPG-J","7419","8558934","RAHMOUNI, KAMAL ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2017"," "," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016"," ","486567"," ","322230","164337"," "," ",
"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain is well recognized as an important determinant of  cardiovascular regulation through its actions on arterial pressure fluid homeostasis and sympathetic nerve activity and has been implicated in hypertension. Growing evidence has advanced the concept that the  RAS both in the brain and periphery also regulates energy expenditure. However the precise central and peripheral mechanisms by which angiotensin II (ANG) regulates energy homeostasis its sites of production and action in the brain the neural circuitry involved and its integration with other pathways controlling feeding and energy homeostasis remain undefined. Similarly it remains unclear if the mechanisms and efferent pathways regulating the cardiovascular versus metabolic actions of ANG are similar or distinct. During the previous funding period we reported compelling data advancing the concept that activation of angiotensinergic signaling in the brain results in increased energy expenditure. Our overall hypothesis is that there are differential central mechanisms controlling the cardiovascular and metabolic outputs following brain RAS activation and that local synthesis of ANG in the brain controls arterial pressure water intake and energy expenditure through overiapping yet discrete ANG-dependent mechanisms and efferent pathways. We further hypothesize that the adipose RAS through AT2R modulates the actions of the brain RAS on adipose tissue and that diet-induced obesity (DIO) blunts the effects of brain RAS activation on energy expenditure by stimulating the adipose RAS acting through an AT2R-dependent mechanism. The aims ofthe proposal are to address the following hypotheses. 1) ANG production and angiotensinergic signaling in the SFO and PVN are critical mediators of the arterial pressure water intake and energy expenditure responses to exogenous and endogenous brain RAS  activation; 2) The effects of increased brain RAS activity are modulated by the activity ofthe adipose RAS  induced by DIO and mediated by an AT2R-dependent mechanism; 3) Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the SFO and PVN plays an important role in the arterial pressure water intake and energy expenditure responses to increased brain RAS activity. We will capitalize on exciting new preliminary data and leverage conceptual advances and the unique expertise of the investigators in this program in genetics neural control mechanisms neuroanatomy and sophisticated cardiovascular and metabolic phenotyping.  A distinctive strength is the extensive intellectual and technical interactions with the other projects.","AGTR2 gene;Ablation;Address;Adipose tissue;Agonist;Angiotensin II;Angiotensinogen;Angiotensins;Biological Markers;Body Weight;Brain;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cardiovascular system;Cell Nucleus;Complement;DOCA;Data;Diet;Efferent Pathways;Energy Metabolism;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Models;Genetic Techniques;Growth;Homeostasis;Hypertension;Instruction;Liquid substance;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Metabolic;Modality;Monitor;Mus;Nerve;Neuroanatomy;Obesity;Output;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Play;Production;Protein Isoforms;Protocols documentation;Receptor Activation;Receptor Signaling;Regulation;Renin;Renin-Angiotensin System;Reporting;Research Personnel;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Testing;Thermogenesis;Transgenic Organisms;Water consumption;blood pressure regulation;design;endoplasmic reticulum stress;energy balance;feeding;innovation;metabolic phenotype;mind control;neural circuit;neuroregulation;novel;pressure;prevent;programs;receptor;response","Role of the brain Renin-Angiotensin Sys. in Cardiovas and Metabolic Regulation","RELEVANCE (See Instructions):  These studies are significant in advancing the concepts of a) differential central mechanisms by which  the brain RAS regulates arterial pressure water intake and energy expenditure b) novel integration  between the central and adipose RAS and c) ER stress as a novel signaling modality in the brain.

"Cardiovascular; Hypertension; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Obesity","The sympathetic nervous system and angiotensin II (ANG) are implicated in obesity-induced hypertension (HT) but the mechanisms are poorly defined. Our preliminary data support a role for brain ANG signaling in increased arterial pressure (AP) in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Additional data reveal striking endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in key brain cardiovascular control regions (SFO-PVN axis) in DIO and indicate that chemical manipulation of ER stress influences sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and AP in this model. Our data also demonstrate that DIO causes oxidative stress in the SFO-PVN axis and this is linked to ER stress. Furthermore new preliminary data show that both ER stress and oxidative stress in this brain axis are coupled to leptin signaling in DIO mice. Additional new data raise the possibility that DIO-mediated oxidative and ER stress in the brain modulate the facilitatory effect of brain ANG on energy expenditure (EE). Based on these promising multifaceted preliminary data we will address four innovative and interrelated concepts: 1) dissociation between central mechanisms controlling energy homeostasis and cardiovascular responses in obesity-HT; 2) brain ER stress a new disease paradigm as a key underlying mechanism; 3) the role of redox signaling with potential links to ER stress pathways in obesity-HT and 4) the SFO-PVN axis as a major player in DIO-mediated cardiovascular and metabolic dysregulation. We will address the overall hypothesis that in DIO mice increased brain ANG and/or leptin signaling promotes ER stress and oxidant stress in the SFO-PVN axis. We postulate that this ER/oxidant stress contributes to the increased renal SNA and AP in DIO mice but conversely acts in the SFO-PVN axis to blunt or reverse brain ANG- and/or leptin-mediated facilitatory effects on thermogenic SNA and EE in this model of obesity-HTN. To address this innovative hypothesis we have assembled multiple sophisticated research tools including 1) genetically engineered mouse models and viral vectors that allow brain site-selective targeting of key ANG oxidant and ER stress molecules; 2) state-of-the-art assays for visualizing and quantifying ER stress; 3) sophisticated integrative physiology for evaluating AP SNA and EE.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):    The central nervous system (CNS) plays important roles in the regulation of blood pressure and body weight and abnormalities in these pathways can cause both hypertension and obesity. Obesity and hypertension remain a serious health problem worldwide in particular in Western societies where the incidence of hypertension and obesity-associated hypertension continues to rise. The long term goal and central theme of the Central Regulation of Blood Pressure and Metabolism (CRBPM) PPG is to understand fundamental mechanisms by which central angiotensin (ANG) and leptin regulate blood pressure in hypertension and obesity-associated hypertension and their convergence on energy homeostasis. The Program will focus on conditions of activation of the central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and altered leptin signaling in hypertension and diet-induced obesity (DIG) and on the role of brain endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidant stress as mechanisms regulating sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) blood pressure and energy homeostasis. The projects will test several novel hypothesis. Project 1 hypothesizes that ER/oxidant stress contributes to the increased renal SNA and blood pressure in DIG mice but conversely acts in the SFG-PVN axis to blunt or reverse brain ANG- and/or leptin-mediated facilitatory effects on thermogenic SNA and energy expenditure in this model of obesity-hypertension. Project 2 will test the hypothesis of that local synthesis of ANG in the brain controls blood pressure water intake and energy expenditure through overlapping yet discrete ANG-dependent mechanisms and efferent pathways and that DIG blunts the effects of brain RAS activation on energy expenditure by stimulating the adipose RAS acting through an AT2R-dependent mechanism. Project 3 will test the hypothesis that Bbs genes in the central nervous system are critical for the control of energy homeostasis and the autonomic regulation of blood pressure and that defects in the brain BBSome receptor trafficking ER stress and the brain RAS are critically involved in the metabolic autonomic and blood pressure alterations associated with BBS. The Program is tightly focused and cohesive and is strengthen by one administrative and two scientific cores. The investigators are highly productive interactive and will employ sophisticated molecular genetic and physiological approaches. The findings will clarify important mechanisms which may allow translation into improved treatment for cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction in hypertension and obesity-hypertension.","Accreditation;Address;Adipose tissue;Affect;Angiotensin Receptor;Angiotensins;Animals;Autonomic Dysfunction;Biological Markers;Blood Pressure;Body Weight;Brain;Breeding;Cardiovascular system;Complement;Consult;DOCA;Data;Data Analyses;Defect;Diet;Disease;Dissociation;Efferent Pathways;Electron Microscopy;Endoplasmic Reticulum;Energy Metabolism;Equipment;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genotype;Goals;Harvest;Health;Homeostasis;Human;Hypertension;Hypothalamic structure;In Vitro;Incidence;Injection of therapeutic agent;Institution;Iowa;Kidney;Leptin;Leptin resistance;Link;Maintenance;Measurement;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Metabolic;Metabolism;Methods;Microscopic;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Mus;Nerve;Neuraxis;Neuroanatomy;Neurons;Obesity;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Peripheral;Phase;Physiological;Play;Population;Predisposition;Preparation;Pro-Opiomelanocortin;Process;Production;Progress Reports;Proteins;Quality Control;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Renin-Angiotensin System;Research;Research Personnel;Robin bird;Role;Services;Signal Transduction;Site;Societies;Structure of nucleus infundibularis hypothalami;Subfornical Organ;Technical Expertise;Techniques;Testing;Training;Transgenic Animals;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Model;Transgenic Organisms;Translations;Universities;Viral Vector;Water consumption;Work;blood pressure regulation;cost effective;design;endoplasmic reticulum stress;energy balance;improved;innovation;instrumentation;knockout animal;leptin receptor;light microscopy;medical schools;mind control;model design;mouse model;neurophysiology;neuroregulation;novel;oxidant stress;paraventricular nucleus;pressure;programs;receptor;repository;research study;response;symposium;trafficking;viral gene delivery","PPG-Genetic and Signaling Mechanisms in the Central Regulation of Blood Pressure","The goal of these studies is to define and clarify fundamental mechanisms by which central angiotensin and leptin regulate arterial pressure in hypertension and obesity-associated hypertension and how these pathways converge on energy homeostasis.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) causes 2200 deaths in Americans every day with one death every 39 seconds. There is evidence that these deaths can be prevented with better risk factor management however many risk factors remain uncontrolled. The Patient-Centered Medical Home (Medical Home) which includes self-management personalized health records and team-based care has been proposed as a strategy to reduce these gaps in care delivery. Several Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses have found evidence that adding pharmacists to the primary care team improves risk factor control and physician adherence to guidelines. Managed care organizations have found that a centralized cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) managed by pharmacists can reduce mortality. A gap in the literature is that it is not known whether a comprehensive CVRS model would be implemented in typical office practices in un-integrated settings. Simultaneously systematic reviews of mobile health (mHealth) trials including disease management apps have found no trial that has incorporated communication with a pharmacist and this lack of evidence is a major gap in the mHealth literature. The objective of this application is to develop and test a mobile app enabled pharmacist managed CVRS for disseminating and implementing evidence-based guidelines in practice. In addition to developing the app with patients as design partners we willconduct a multi-center individually randomized study nested within an ongoing NIH trial in medical offices with large geographic racial and ethnic diversity. We will randomize 100 patients from primary care offices to mHealth CVRS (mobile app + web site + pharmacist) or to CVRS only (web site + pharmacist) of whom 55 will be from racial/ethnic minorities. Our central hypothesis is that the mHealth CVRS designed with patients as partners will be implemented and significantly improve patient engagement leading to improved CVD guideline adherence using the Get with The Guidelines and Guideline Advantage metrics. The rationale for this proposed study is that a novel mHealth model that improves secondary prevention of CVD with pharmacist assistance will lead to broader adoption by health systems throughout the US. Our primary Aim is: to examine the feasibility of mHealth technology to disseminate evidence- based risk reduction guidelines in a prospective randomized controlled trial among diverse primary care offices. We postulate that system engagement (primary hypothesis) and adherence to guidelines for secondary prevention of CVD (secondary hypothesis) will be significantly greater in patients randomized to the mHealth intervention compared to the control group. This study is expected to produce the following outcomes: unique mobile app features that complement the standard CVRS increased engagement with a CVRS and increased achievement of guideline- concordant therapy."," ","Design and Testing of a Mobile Cardiovascular Risk Service with Patient Partners","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Risk factors for cardiovascular disease are poorly controlled even for patients who frequently visit their physician leading to large numbers of preventable cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. Research from integrated healthcare systems suggests that risk factors can be controlled better and treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease can be markedly improved by using a centralized cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) managed by pharmacists. We are confident that a pharmacist-managed mHealth CVRS can become a strategy in un-integrated healthcare settings to markedly reduce cardiovascular events in the United States.","AHRQ","9038310","2/16/2016","RFA-HS-14-010","5R21HS023952-02","5","R21","HS","023952","02","","WYATT, DERRICK ","4/1/2015","3/31/2018","ZHS1-HSR-F(01)"," ","1974680","CHRISCHILLES, ELIZABETH A","Not Applicable","01","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2016","3/31/2018"," ","226","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","148924"," ","AHRQ","98625","50299"," ","148924",
"Cardiovascular; Diabetes; Heart Disease; Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and insulin resistance are independent risk factors for heart failure. The long- term goal of this proposal is to understand the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and cardiac dysfunction in these populations. Hyperinsulinemia may also accelerate adverse LV remodeling in pressure overload hypertrophy and genetic reduction of insulin signaling in cardiomyocytes limits hypertrophic remodeling and reduces apoptosis in pressure overload thereby preserving LV function. Our recent studies reveal that hyperinsulinemia desensitizes -AR-mediated stimulation of cardiac contractility by promoting 2ARGi-biased signaling and by inducing the phosphodiesterase (PDE4D) which represents a novel mechanism linking insulin resistance hyperinsulinemia and LV dysfunction. This proposal will test the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia attenuates LV contractility by directly impairing AR signaling via two distinct mechanisms: (1) Increased 2AR/Gi coupling that inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP production and (2) Increased expression of PDE4D that increases cAMP degradation. This multi PI proposal reflects an active collaboration by the laboratories of Evan Dale Abel (University of Iowa) and Yang Kevin Xiang (University of California -Davis). Our combined expertise in myocardial insulin signaling and myocardial adrenergic signaling using novel molecular biosensors to define subcellular adrenergic signaling domains in cardiomyocytes and a comprehensive array of mutant mouse models with perturbed IR or AR signaling will address this hypothesis in the following three specific aims. Aim 1 (Xiang): Will define the molecular mechanisms for and consequences of PDE4 induction in response to chronic hyperinsulinemia. Hypothesis: Insulin signaling reduces cAMP levels by increasing cardiac PDE4 levels for cAMP hydrolysis via 2AR-ERK dependent modulation of PDE4 transcription and protein turnover. Aim 2 (Abel): Will determine the mechanisms by which modulation of IR-2AR signaling may attenuate obesity associated LV dysfunction. Hypothesis: Acute or chronic hyperinsulinemia will impair myocardial AR signaling and reduce contractility or inotropic reserve by promoting cAMP degradation and genetic or pharmacological inhibition of this crosstalk will preserve LV function in hyperinsulinemic states. Aim 3 (Abel). Will determine if IR-2AR crosstalk contributes to LV dysfunction in heart failue or in subjects with insulin resistance. Hypothesis: LV or atrial tissue from subjects with heart failure will reveal molecular signatures consistent with increased IR-2AR ERK activation and PDE4 induction and insulin resistant subjects will exhibit impaired heart rate responses to sub-maximal exercise. These studies will comprehensively dissect the mechanism for IR-AR crosstalk that limits myocardial contractility in insulin resistant states and may lead to novel approaches for treating or preventing heart failure in the high risk population with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome.","ADRBK1 gene;Acute;Address;Adenylate Cyclase;Adrenergic Agents;Animals;Apoptosis;Attenuated;Biopsy;Biosensor;California;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiomyopathies;Chronic;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Coupling;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Diabetes Mellitus;Epidemiologic Studies;Exercise;Exhibits;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Functional disorder;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Heart;Heart Atrium;Heart Rate;Heart failure;Human;Hydrolysis;Hyperinsulinism;Hypertrophy;IRS1 gene;Impairment;In Vitro;Insulin;Insulin Receptor;Insulin Resistance;Iowa;Journals;Knock-out;Laboratories;Lead;Left;Left Ventricular Dysfunction;Left Ventricular Function;Left Ventricular Remodeling;Link;Mediating;Metabolic Control;Metabolic syndrome;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Profiling;Mus;Muscle Cells;Myocardial;Myocardial dysfunction;Myocardium;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Phosphorylation;Population;Prevalence;Prevention;Production;Protein Isoforms;Protocols documentation;Publishing;Randomized;Receptor Signaling;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Testing;Tissues;United States;Universities;Ventricular;Ventricular Remodeling;Weight;Yang;auricular appendage;constriction;feeding;glucose uptake;high risk;insulin sensitivity;insulin signaling;left ventricular assist device;mortality;mouse model;mutant;mutant mouse model;novel;novel strategies;phosphodiesterase IV;phospholamban;phosphoric diester hydrolase;pressure;prevent;protein degradation;receptor;response;trafficking","Insulin Inhibition of beta-AR Signaling in the Myocardium","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality in the United States. Obesity and insulin resistance are independent risk factors for heart failure. The present study will address the critical question of the role of altered beta-adrenergic signaling in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in obesity type 2 diabetes and other insulin-resistant states. We will determine if augmented myocardial insulin signaling as a consequence of the hyperinsulinemia that develops in obesity and type 2 diabetes directly impairs the adrenergic signaling in the heart leading to reduced cardiac contractility.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Substance Abuse","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and dependence are responsible for considerable public health harms; yet the majority of people with an alcohol use disorder do not receive treatment and some social groups are less likely than others to receive alcohol services. Specifically racial/ethnic minorities appear less likely than Whites to obtain any help for problem drinking receive specialty alcohol treatment or attend 12-step groups. In addition there are gender differences. Among those with alcohol use disorders women are less likely to obtain treatment more likely to present with comorbid conditions and remain in treatment for shorter durations than men. Furthermore gender may exacerbate racial/ethnic disparities. Among men Latinos are less likely and Blacks are equally likely to receive alcohol services as Whites; however both Black and Latina women have approximately one-quarter the odds of obtaining alcohol services as White women. To date the mechanisms responsible for disparities in use of alcohol services remain poorly understood. Much of the current literature suffers from methodological limitations (e.g. cross-sectional data; limited sampling). General population studies of alcohol services disparities are sparse and no known study has explicitly tested mediators of such disparities. In response to PA-13-288 (Behavioral and Social Science Research on Understanding and Reducing Health Disparities) the proposed study seeks to explain racial/ethnic and gender disparities in alcohol services use. Using longitudinal data obtained in the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) a representative sample of the US population that included oversamples of racial/ethnic minorities and young adults we will examine use of specialty treatment and 12-step groups among White Black and Latino participants who met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at Wave 1 (2001-2002) and who completed a Wave 2 follow-up interview (2004-2005). Drawing on Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use we will identify predisposing enabling/inhibiting and need factors associated with alcohol services use. Specific aims include: (1) testing in longitudinal data previously observed racial/ethnic and gender disparities in alcohol service use; (2) assessing whether differential levels of enabling factors (e.g. educational attainment; insurance coverage) and inhibiting factors (e.g. discrimination; drinking context) explain how gender moderates the effect of race/ethnicity on alcohol services use; and (3) assessing barriers to alcohol services use by race/ethnicity and gender among those with an AUD who did not seek any help for their drinking during the follow-up period. By focusing on the combined effects of race/ethnicity and gender the study will provide further information about sub-groups for whom risk of unmet alcohol treatment need is greatest including racial/ethnic minorities and women. By testing potential mediators findings will extend current knowledge about the mechanisms responsible for disparities and may identify leverage points for interventions to increase alcohol services use.         ","Address;Age;Alcohol abuse;Alcohol dependence;Alcohols;Behavioral Model;Child;Comorbidity;DSM-IV;Data;Development;Discrimination;Enabling Factors;Epidemiology;Ethnic Origin;Family history of;Gender;General Population;Healthy People 2020;Individual;Insurance Coverage;Intervention;Interview;Knowledge;Latina;Latino;Lead;Literature;Longitudinal Surveys;Marital Status;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Mental Depression;Minority;Modeling;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;Pattern;Population;Poverty;Predisposing Factor;Principal Investigator;Public Health;Race;Reporting;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Sampling;Services;Severities;Staging;Strategic Planning;Subgroup;Substance abuse problem;Surveys;Testing;Woman;alcohol abuse therapy;alcohol services;alcohol use disorder;alcoholism therapy;behavioral/social science;drinking;ethnic difference;ethnic minority population;experience;follow-up;gender difference;gender disparity;health disparity;health service use;improved;longitudinal analysis;medical specialties;meetings;men;primary outcome;programs;public health relevance;racial and ethnic;racial and ethnic disparities;response;secondary outcome;social group;social science research;young adult","Factors Responsible for Racial-Gender Disparities in Alcohol Services Use","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study supports the NIAAA Strategic Plan to Address Health Disparities which calls for research on alcoholism treatment and other health services use and Healthy People 2020 objective SA-8.3 which calls for increasing the proportion of people with an alcohol use disorder who receive treatment.

"Nutrition; Obesity; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The modern world has experienced enormous growth in obesity a disease associated with increased incidence of and mortality from diabetes cardiovascular disease and cancer. Even moderate weight loss in the range of 5-10% has been shown to prevent the long-term consequences of obesity. Unfortunately the current treatment options for obesity remain limited in both their application and effect.  Our preliminary data indicate that sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels limit muscle energy expenditure under physiological workload while KATP channel deficit provokes an extra energy cost of muscle performance. Inefficient fuel metabolism in KATP channel-deficient muscles reduces body fat deposits promoting a lean phenotype. The current proposal builds on this finding to determine the mechanisms by which KATP channel function affects skeletal muscle performance and adipose tissue mobilization.  We hypothesize that membrane potential modulation due to KATP channel opening in response to a physiological workload limits calcium and sodium inward currents and thus energy consumption related to ion homeostasis and contraction continuation. Under conditions of surplus calorie intake this promotes weight gain. Conversely disruption of KATP channel function would result in exaggerated cellular calcium turnover causing increased energy consumption and activation of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase (Ca2+/CaMKII). We propose that induction of CaMKII triggers both Akt-dependent production and Ca2+- dependent secretion of a signaling peptide - musclin. This peptide is known for its ability to modulate clearance of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) - a potet activator of lipolysis. In this way musclin signaling could translate increased activity related energy consumption into adipose tissue mobilization. The goal of this project is to directly study the molecular mechanism of KATP channel control of activity- related energy consumption and the mechanism of consequent adipose tissue mobilization and body weight reduction.  The proposed investigation will be performed across multiple models - biochemical and electrophysiological studies on cellular and isolated organ levels will be used to verify molecularmechanisms for findings obtained on the whole body level. Understanding these mechanisms will provide novel avenues for targeted management and prevention of obesity and related diseases.","Acute;Address;Adipose tissue;Affect;Area;Atrial Natriuretic Factor;Biochemical;Biology;Body Weight;Body Weight decreased;Body fat;Calcium;Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase;Cardiovascular Diseases;Consumption;Data;Deposition;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Eating;Electrophysiology (science);Energy Metabolism;Epidemic;Equilibrium;Equipment;FOXO1A gene;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Food Energy;Functional disorder;Goals;Growth;Homeostasis;Incidence;Intake;Investigation;Ions;Laboratories;Lipolysis;Malignant Neoplasms;Medical;Membrane;Membrane Potentials;Messenger RNA;Metabolism;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Obesity;Obesity associated disease;Organ;Peptide Signal Sequences;Peptides;Performance;Phenotype;Physiological;Population;Prevention;Production;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt;Publishing;Regulation;Role;Signal Transduction;Skeletal Muscle;Social Impacts;Sodium;Therapeutic;Transgenic Mice;Translating;Translations;Weight Gain;Weight maintenance regimen;Workload;base;biochemical model;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;cost;economic impact;energy balance;experience;inhibitor/antagonist;mortality;mouse model;novel;obesity treatment;prevent;response;success","Skeletal muscle KATP channels determine bodily energy balance","Obesity is occurring at epidemic rates and has exceeded 30% of the U.S. population.

"Bioengineering","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a critical need to develop a new device to noninvasively treat mesh infections without removing the mesh. In the absence of such a device the treatment of mesh infections will remain highly invasive and costly. This study's objective is to optimize cavitation-based histotripsy to treat surgical mesh infections. Histotrips generates/excites a cloud of micron sized bubbles in the tissue which mechanically shred the targeted cells. The physics of microbubble collapse promotes lysis of bacteria attached to the implant enhancing the destruction of the bacteria biofilm causing the infection.  Specific Aim #1: Verify biofilm destruction on a mesh target. Our preliminary studies treated biofilms on planar surfaces. The working hypothesis is that the ultrasound will be equally effective at treating biofilms on the mesh structure. This hypothesis will be tested by in vitro and in vivo experiments where infected meshes will be treated with ultrasound induced cavitation under varying exposure conditions.  Specific Aim #2: Evaluate the impact of the therapy on mesh functionality. With infection the fibrous tissue disintegrates at the site of infection and the mesh loosens. Further loosening in the short term might also occur in the vicinity of the mesh from the histotripsy exposure. However if the extent of damage is small (i.e. less than a few millimeters) then we hypothesize the tissue will heal around the mesh as is expected during normal implantation following the treatment. This hypothesis will be tested using a rabbit peritoneal mesh infection model.  This project is significant because once developed thousands of patients each year would have an alternative to invasive surgery for treating mesh infections. The proposed research is innovative because it will potentially provide a noninvasive treatment option where there are no other alternatives currently.      ","Aftercare;Bacteria;Cell Count;Cells;Colony-forming units;Complication;Cytolysis;Devices;Excision;Focused Ultrasound Therapy;Future;Goals;Harvest;Healed;Hernia;Hernia of abdominal cavity;Histology;Human;Implant;In Vitro;Incidence;Infection;Lead;Medical;Methods;Microbial Biofilms;Microbubbles;Modeling;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Patients;Peritoneal;Physics;Process;Public Health;Publishing;Repeat Surgery;Research;Site;Structure;Surface;Surgical Mesh;System;Testing;Time;Tissues;Treatment Efficacy;Ultrasonography;Work;base;healing;implantation;in vitro testing;in vivo;innovation;medical implant;millimeter;operation;public health relevance;repaired;research clinical testing;research study;tool","Feasibility of Histotripsy to Treat Infections on Surgical Mesh","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to lead to a treatment of infections on surgical meshes following hernia repair.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Lung; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Twenty years after the discovery of the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis (CF) was identified we have no new therapies that can restore function to the mutant protein associated with the most common form of the disease. The majority of CF-associated morbidity and mortality arises from progressive pulmonary infection and inflammation. The most common CFTR mutation F508 is present on ~70% of mutant alleles and causes protein misfolding leading to proteosomal degradation. We discovered a novel microRNA (miRNA)-regulated gene network that influences CFTR transcription and processing and restores CFTR-F508 function in airway epithelia. MiR-138 regulates CFTR expression through its interactions with the transcriptional regulatory protein SIN3A. SIN3A inhibition altersthe expression of genes encoding proteins that associate with CFTR and may influence its biosynthesis. Manipulating this regulatory network improves CFTR-F508 biosynthesis and restores Cl- transport to CF airway epithelia. This proposal leverages our knowledge of the SIN3A-regulated gene network to design new therapies for CF. We will: 1) Identify the key SIN3A-regulated gene products responsible for CFTR-F508 rescue; 2) Use the genomic signatures of SIN3A-mediated CFTR-F508 rescue to identify therapeutic agents; and 3) Use lead compounds to rescue CFTR function in newborn pigs with the F508 mutation.

"Cancer; Genetics; Prevention; Urologic Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the U.S. and the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis because of its high incidence of recurrence and the lack of effective targeted therapeutics. An expected 70000 patients will be diagnosed with and 15000 patients will die of urinary bladder cancer in the U.S. this year alone. Despite the high incidence and lack of therapy for bladder cancer the mechanisms of tumor initiation and progression are largely unknown. The greatest risk factor for bladder cancer is smoking which promotes malignant transformation of transitional epithelial cells of the bladder by mechanisms involving DNA damage and oncogene activation. Here we provide the first evidence for entirely novel signaling actions of Regulator of G protein Signaling6 (RGS6) as an essential mediator of p53 induction during genotoxic stress and as a tumor suppressor in bladder. RGS6 is dramatically induced by tumorigenic stimuli including genotoxic stress and oncogene activation. RGS6 functions as an upstream activator of the ATM-p53- apoptosis pathway yet also induces apoptosis arrests cell proliferation and blocks oncogenic transformation of cells by p53-independent mechanisms. These actions of RGS6 are independent of its canonical function as a heterotrimeric G protein in activator. We previously described a single nucleotide polymorphism in RGS6 which leads to increased RGS6 translation which is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of bladder cancer in humans particularly in smokers. Given these findings it is especially significant that we observed a dramatically accelerated bladder carcinogenesis and loss of p53 induction in RGS6 null mice in response to their treatment with BBN a DNA-damaging carcinogen derived from tobacco smoke that induces bladder carcinogenesis in mice closely mimicking that observed in the majority of human patients. The robust expression of RGS6 we found in bladder transitional epithelial cells was dramatically lost in patients with invasive bladder cancer. Our central hypothesis formulated on the basis of compelling preliminary data is that RGS6 is a novel master regulator of both DNA damage signaling and tumor suppression in bladder. Three specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the importance of RGS6 as a tumor suppressor in a mouse model of bladder carcinogenesis and the role of p53 and ARF in its tumor suppressor function 2) Determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which RGS6 functions as an upstream modulator of DNA damage signaling and as a tumor suppressor in bladder transitional epithelial cells and 3) Determine the molecular basis for RGS6 loss in human bladder cancer. These aims seek to elucidate the role of RGS6 in suppression of bladder tumorigenesis and the underlying mechanisms involved. Loss of RGS6 as observed in human bladder tumors or its mutational inactivation would be expected to confer tumor cells with a predisposition to aberrant growth and enhanced survival hallmarks of malignancy. The significance of these studies to human health is great. They will provide new understanding of the pathogenesis of urinary bladder cancer and potentially identify RGS6 as a biomarker for the prognosis or diagnosis of bladder cancer as well as a new therapeutic target for its treatment.","Abnormal Cell;Apoptosis;Biological Markers;Bladder;Bladder Neoplasm;Carcinogens;Cell Proliferation;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Repair;Data;Diagnosis;Doxorubicin;Epigenetic Process;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Family member;GTP-Binding Protein Regulators;GTP-Binding Proteins;Genes;Genetic;Genotoxic Stress;Grant;Growth;Health;Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins;Human;Incidence;Knockout Mice;Laboratories;Link;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder;Mediator of activation protein;MicroRNAs;Mitochondria;Molecular;Molecular Analysis;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Mutation;Oncogene Activation;Oncogenic;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Predisposition;RGS Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recurrence;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Transduction;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Smoker;Smoking;Stimulus;TP53 gene;Tobacco smoke;Translations;Tumor Suppression;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Tumorigenicity;Up-Regulation;Work;base;cancer genetics;cancer risk;carcinogenesis;cell transformation;diagnostic biomarker;in vivo;innovation;loss of function;loss of function mutation;member;metaplastic cell transformation;mortality;mouse model;neoplastic cell;new therapeutic target;novel;outcome forecast;prevent;prognostic;response;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tumor initiation;tumor progression;tumorigenesis;tumorigenic","Molecular Analysis and Role of RGS6 as a Novel Growth Suppressor","Our central hypothesis is that RGS6 is a novel inducible tumor suppressor in bladder.

"Cancer; Genetics; Hematology; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immunodeficiencies (inherited or acquired) and lymphocyte malignancy are two major immune disorders that pose grave threats to public health. Firstly loss of T cells in adults (e.g. due to chemotherapy or ageing) severely compromises cellular immunity. How the distinct CD4+ and CD8+ T cell identities are established and maintained remains an unanswered puzzling question at present. Secondly acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphomas (T-ALLs) is induced by the transformation of developing T cells in the thymus. Elucidation of factors/pathways contributing to initiation and propagation of T-ALLs is required to improve diagnosis and develop novel targeted therapies.  Tcf1 and Lef1 transcription factors are well documented to have essential roles in T cell development. We also showed that Tcf1 functions as a tumor suppressor by restraining Lef1 and Notch expression in early thymocytes. Tcf1 and Lef1 are most notably associated with the Wnt--catenin pathway; however the long- standing controversies regarding the physiological roles of -catenin in T cell development and malignancy remain unresolved.  By conditionally targeting both Tcf1 and Lef1 at CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes we found that Tcf1/Lef1 double deficient CD8+ T cells showed inappropriate expression of CD4+ lineage genes including the CD4 coreceptor itself CD40 ligand Rorgt and Foxp3 without prior activation. We hypothesize that Tcf1 and Lef1 seal off CD8+ T cell identity by epigenetically silencing CD4+-associated genes. We have generated a true -catenin null mutant and another mouse strain where Tcf1 long isoforms are ablated and hence Tcf1-- catenin interaction is abrogated. With these new tools we will test the hypothesis that Tcf1 and Lef1 use both -catenin-dependent and -independent mechanisms to regulate thymocyte maturation and transformation. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim 1. To investigate the mechanisms by which Tcf1 and Lef1 regulate CD8+ T cell identity. Specific Aim 2. To elucidate the requirements of -catenin and its interaction with Tcf1/Lef1 in T cell development and malignancy.  These studies will identify the first transcription factors and their interaction with epigenetic machinery that re responsible for regulation of CD8+ T cell identity. The new animal models will ensure unprecedented clarity to resolve the long-standing controversies over -catenin. The outcomes will establish new paradigms in immune cell identity and the involvement of Wnt--catenin pathway. The information will identify critical regulatory points in directing hematopoietic progenitors or iPS cells to mature T cells with desired antigen specificity and thus help improve immune reconstitution and targeted cell-based cancer therapy.","Acute;Acute T Cell Leukemia;Adult;Age;Animal Model;Antigens;Bacteria;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD40 Ligand;CD8B1 gene;Cell Lineage;Cells;Cellular Immunity;Diagnosis;Ensure;Epigenetic Process;Etiology;Gene Targeting;Genes;Hematopoietic;Immune;Immune System Diseases;Immune response;Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes;Infection Control;Inherited;Knowledge;Lymphoblastic Leukemia;Lymphocyte;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Mature T-Lymphocyte;Methyltransferase;Modeling;Mouse Strains;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Process;Production;Protein Isoforms;Public Health;Published Comment;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Role;Specific qualifier value;Specificity;Staging;T-Cell Development;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Thymus Gland;Tumor Suppression;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;Virus;base;beta catenin;cancer therapy;chemotherapy;cytotoxic;genetic analysis;histone modification;improved;induced pluripotent stem cell;leukemia/lymphoma;mutant;new therapeutic target;notch protein;novel strategies;pathogen;progenitor;public health relevance;recombinase;reconstitution;seal;thymocyte;tool;transcription factor;transcriptome;translational medicine","Tcf/Lef-b-catenin in T cell identity and cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: CD4 and CD8 T cells are critical components in cellular immunity that controls infection by bacteria viruses and other pathogens.

"Cystic Fibrosis; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence determinants are preferentially expressed during the acute or chronic phases of colonization. For instance expression of the type III secretion (T3SS) and the cAMP/Vfr signaling (CVS) systems is important for virulence in acute animal infection models. These same factors however are not expressed in isolates obtained from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infections. At least two global regulatory pathways (RsmA and MucA/AlgU) inversely regulate T3SS/CVS and chronic virulence gene expression. The RsmA pathway inversely regulates T3SS/CVS gene expression with biofilm formation (common in the CF airways) and is dependent upon RsmA an RNA binding protein that regulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The MucA/AlgU pathway activates mucoid conversion (a common trait of CF isolates) but inhibits T3SS/CVS gene expression. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the RsmA and AlgU/MucA regulatory pathways modulate ExsA (the primary transcriptional regulator of the T3SS) and Vfr expression at the post-transcriptional level. The long-term goal of these studies is to define regulatory mechanisms that govern the acute to chronic transition using the T3SS and CVS as model systems by addressing the following specific aims.  Aim 1. Determine how RsmA promotes ExsA and Vfr expression at the post-transcriptional level. Our preliminary data indicate that purified RsmA binds directly to the 5' untranslated regions of the vfr and exsA mRNAs and stimulates Vfr expression in an in vitro translation assay. Based on these data we will test a novel translational derepression model whereby RsmA binding relieves secondary structures within the exsA and vfr mRNAs that sequester the ribosome binding site or otherwise inhibit translation.  Aim 2. Determine how the MucA/AlgU system alters the availability of free RsmA to control ExsA and CVS expression. Our data indicate that the expression of RsmA RsmY and RsmZ are significantly elevated in the mucA mutant. The experiments proposed in this aim will test the hypothesis that the MucA/AlgU system controls Vfr and ExsA expression by reducing the concentration of free RsmA in cells.  Aim 3. Determine how RsmB activity is controlled and how RsmB promotes ExsA and Vfr expression at the post-transcriptional level. Although plasmid-expressed RsmB restores ExsA and Vfr expression in an rsmArsmB double mutant we find that purified RsmB does not bind to the same vfr and exsA mRNA probes bound by RsmA. Purified RsmA and RsmB however do bind with similar affinity to a control probe indicating that purified RsmB is active. To determine how RsmB promotes ExsA and Vfr expression we will map the RsmB-responsive region and ask whether RsmB binds to the exsA and vfr mRNAs in vivo.","5&apos; Untranslated Regions;Accounting;Acute;Address;Affinity;Alginates;Animals;Bacterial Infections;Binding;Binding Sites;Biological Models;Blood Circulation;Cells;Chronic;Chronic Phase;Complement;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;Data;Defect;Exotoxins;Family;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Homeostasis;Homologous Gene;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Life;Maps;Messenger RNA;Microbial Biofilms;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plasmids;Pneumonia;Polysaccharides;Post-Transcriptional Regulation;Production;Protein Family;Pseudomonas;Pseudomonas aeruginosa;RNA-Binding Proteins;Regulation;Regulatory Pathway;Regulon;Ribosomes;Role;Sepsis;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Structure;System;Testing;Tissues;Translational Derepression;Translations;Type II Secretion System Pathway;Type III Secretion System Pathway;Urinary tract infection;Virulence;Virulence Factors;base;capsule;cell motility;cystic fibrosis airway;cystic fibrosis patients;differential expression;in vitro Assay;in vivo;member;mortality;mucoid;mutant;novel;pathogen;quorum sensing;research study;soft tissue;trait;translation assay","Post-transcriptional regulation of Pseudomonas virulence gene expression","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes life-threatening acute and chronic infection in humans.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Health Services; Pediatric; Pediatric Research Initiative","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) are common birth defects affecting about 1 in 1250 children in the US. Numerous health interventions including surgical medical dental speech services are needed to target the multiple health complications related to clefts including feeding dental speech and psychosocial problems. For a variety of reasons children with clefts often do not receive all services needed to develop a normal physical appearance and functional ability. A key barrier to accessing needed services is that the services are not always covered by insurance. Many states have attempted to address barriers to care through laws mandating coverage of certain services by private insurance plans and through modifying requirements for coverage of services in their Medicaid programs. While it is clear that significant policy variation exists between states what effect th policies have on health services use and access to care for children with oral clefts is unknown. The proposed study will assess how the generosity of state laws mandating coverage of services needed to treat oral clefts and their complications in private insurance plans and Medicaid programs matters in utilization of care. The study will examine the effects of specific policies that are highly relevant to the healthcare needs of children with oral clefts on use of specific services that are likely to be impacted by these policies capturing both timeliness and frequency of use. For private insurance we measure the state's comprehensiveness in mandating a range of services needed by children with clefts as well as mandates for surgical treatments and speech therapy. For Medicaid we focus on the state's medically necessary standards and generosity of covering orthodontic treatment for children with oral clefts. The analysis will employ large population-based datasets of children with oral clefts in private coverage and Medicaid. The findings will be highly relevant for understanding barriers to care in this population and can be directly translated into policymaking to improve access to needed services in this population. Devising effective policies is the primary and most efficient mechanism for addressing barriers to care on a population level. This study will identify the extent to which enacted policies matter for access to key health services for children with oral clefts.      ","Activities of Daily Living;Address;Adolescence;Affect;Age;Appearance;Area;Caring;Characteristics;Child;Child Care;Child Development;Child Health Services;Child health care;Childhood;Cleaved cell;Cleft Lip;Cleft Palate;Clinical effectiveness;Congenital Abnormality;Data Set;Databases;Deformity;Deglutition;Dental;Diagnosis;Eating;Enrollment;Esthetics;Frequencies;Future;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Health Policy;Health Services;Health Services Accessibility;Healthcare;Improve Access;Individual;Insurance;Insurance Coverage;Intervention;Laws;Left;Measures;Medicaid;Medical;Operative Surgical Procedures;Orthodontic;Outcome;Play;Policies;Population;Prevalence;Public Health;Role;Sampling;Services;Specific qualifier value;Speech;Speech Therapy;Syndrome;Tooth structure;Translating;Variant;Work;dentofacial;drinking;feeding;health care service utilization;health service use;human capital;improved;improved outcome;indexing;malformation;medically necessary care;oral cleft;population based;programs;psychosocial;public health relevance;screening;success;theories;treatment program","Insurance Coverage Policies and Outcomes of Children with Oral Clefts","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Many states have attempted to improve utilization of care for children with oral clefts through laws mandating coverage of services by private insurance plans and through modifying requirements for oral clefts in their Medicaid programs.

"Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Regenerative Medicine; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Human; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human; Transplantation","Project Summary Autografts and allografts are current standard strategies for bone repair. However each possesses limita-tions such as donor-site morbidity with the use of autograft and the risk of disease transmission with the use ofallograft. Synthetic bone-graft substitute based on a tissue engineering strategy has represented an alternativeapproach to overcome these inherent limitations. In 2009 close to 1.5 billion dollars were spent on bone-graftsubstitutes half of which was attributed to recombinant human BMPs (rhBMPs). rhBMP-2 have been approvedfor inducing spinal fusion fracture healing and filling bony defects following tumor resection. In dentistryrhBMP-2 also have been used in alveolar ridge and sinus augmentation. rhBMP-7 is also used as an autograftalternative for recalcitrant long bone nonunions. However the outcome of rhBMPs is far from satisfactory.Thus the high cost associated with rhBMPs therapy and the reported adverse events following its usage insupra physiological doses strongly underscore the need to develop an alternative approach that is safer morecost-effective and highly efficient for bone regeneration. Our long-term goal is to develop a microRNA (miR)-based gene therapy program that can be used to effectively promote osteogenic differentiation and bone re-generation. MiR-200c is a member of the miR-200 family that is involved in regulation of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition and stem cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent studies demonstrated that miR-200cinhibits both Noggin and multiple proinflammatory factors including NF-kB and IL-8. These factors have beendemonstrate to reduce osteogenic differentiation and bone formation. In our pilot studies we have shown thatthe overexpression of miR-200c can significantly increase the expression of Runx2 a key transcription factorof osteoblasts in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and up-regulate multiple osteogenicbiomarkers in human preosteoblasts. Our objective in this application is to establish a proof of concept inwhich miR-200c can be used to develop a novel miR-based therapeutics for bone regeneration. The centralhypothesis is that miR-200c delivered by a non-viral vector will significantly promote osteogenic differentiationand bone formation in vitro and in vivo. In this project we will determine the molecular function of miR-200cdelivered by polyethylenimine nanoparticles in osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow MSCs (Aim 1)and the efficacy of this approach to induce bone regeneration in vivo (Aim 2). At the completion of this projectit is our expectation that we will significantly expand understanding of the molecular function and potentialmechanisms mediated by miR-200c on osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow MSCs.

"Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Hematology; Infectious Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Within the realm of synthetic carbohydrate chemistry the stereoselective formation of glycosidic bonds is of paramount importance. Efficient manipulation of bond connectivity at the anomeric center opens up new approaches for the synthesis of complex carbohydrates including the 12-cis-2-amino glycosides. These aminosugars make up one of the most important classes of naturally occurring oligosaccharides and glyco-conjugates which play a crucial role as cell-surface receptor ligands for lectins antibodies and enzymes. However progress toward understanding the specific functions of 12-cis-2-aminosugars has been hampered due to the formidable challenge of obtaining an adequate supply of well-defined glycosides from natural sources. In many cases high purity 12-cis-2-aminosugars can only be obtained by chemical synthesis which also provides access to structural variants. Although there have been remarkable advances in the synthesis of 12-cis-2-amino glycosides the disadvantages of current methodologies include the use of excess activating agents and unpredictable/poor anomeric selectivity.  In this grant application our goalis to develop a new and innovative strategy for the effective synthesis of 12-cis-2-amino glycosides via transition metal-catalyzed a-selective glycosylation (Specific Aim 1).

"Adolescent Sexual Activity; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Drug Abuse (NIDA only); HIV/AIDS; Pediatric; Prevention; Rural Health; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine long-term effects of an innovative partnership-based intervention delivery model called PROSPER (PROmoting School/community-university Partnerships to Enhance Resilience). Primary effects examined will be reductions in emerging adult substance misuse antisocial behaviors and sexual risk behaviors for AIDS and other STIs along with improvements in healthy adult functioning among project participants who received evidence-based interventions during middle school.This proposed work extends a randomized control study of the PROSPER model involving two sequential cohorts of youth and families from an understudied rural population. A total of 28 rural school districts in IA and PA ranging in size from approximately 1300 to 5200 students were selected and randomly assigned to either the PROSPER partnership condition or to a usual programming control condition. Local teams in the PROSPER partnership sites selected and implemented family-focused and school-based evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for middle school students. The evaluation of intervention outcomes began with approximately 12000 students (90% of those eligible) in the two cohorts who participated in a 6th grade pretest assessment; follow-up assessments with the students in these cohorts were conducted each spring through the 12th grade. Following 12th grade 2000 randomly selected students from that sample were recruited for continued follow-up assessments. The proposed study will extend those follow-ups to ages 22 and 24.Aims of the proposed study are to: (1) evaluate long-term substance misuse behaviors anti-social behaviors and sexual risk behavior outcomes of the PROSPER partnership-supported middle-school EBIs; and (2) evaluate mediators and moderators of long-term EBI effects informed by an extension of the outcome model specified in the original study. Positive results from the first two grant periods have established PROSPER effectiveness with evidence of: effective functioning of community teams; strong participation in EBIs; long-term high quality EBI implementation; sustainability of teams and EBIs; and economic analyses indicating PROSPER efficiency. Most importantly results show strong EBI outcomes through middle and high school with positive effects on: young adolescent competencies (e.g. peer refusal skills); parenting effectiveness and family functioning; reduced adolescent conduct problems; and reduced misuse of a wide range of substances through the end of high school. These results suggest a unique opportunity for demonstrating early preventive intervention impacts on healthy adult functioning; the prospect of establishing such impacts would constitute a compelling case for national diffusion of the PROSPER model. Literature reviews failed to reveal another study with a comparably large rural sample that allows assessment of intervention effects on general health reduced problem behaviors reduced sexual risk behaviors for AIDS/STIs and other benefits for participants as they transition into adulthood.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adult;Age;Behavior;Child Rearing;Communities;Community Participation;Data;Data Set;Diffusion;Documentation;Drug Prescriptions;Economics;Effectiveness;Epidemiology;Evaluation;Evidence based intervention;Family;Gender;General Population;Goals;Grant;Health;Intervention;Lead;Lifestyle-related condition;Link;Long-Term Effects;Longitudinal Studies;Mediating;Mediation;Mediator of activation protein;Middle School Student;Modeling;Outcome;Outcomes Research;Participant;Penetration;Prevention;Preventive Intervention;Problem behavior;Progress Reports;Public Health;Publishing;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recruitment Activity;Reporting;Research;Research Infrastructure;Review Literature;Risk;Rural;Rural Community;Rural Population;Sampling;Schools;Sexual Health;Site;Specific qualifier value;Staging;Students;System;Universities;Work;Youth;antisocial behavior;base;behavioral outcome;career;cohort;conduct problem;cost efficient;design;elementary school;emerging adult;emerging adulthood;evidence base;follow-up;health economics;high risk;high school;innovation;intervention effect;junior high school;misuse of prescription only drugs;peer;programs;resilience;school district;seventh grade;sex risk;sixth grade;skills;social capital;substance misuse;success;therapy design;twelfth grade","Partnership Model for Diffusion of Proven Prevention","The proposed study examines how an innovative system for delivering evidence-based preventive interventions designed for general populations can have substantial public health impact.

"Biotechnology; Cystic Fibrosis; Infectious Diseases; Lung; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Respiratory infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in many diseases including Cystic Fibrosis (CF). In spite of current therapies more than 90% of people with CF die from respiratory infections. CF is caused by mutations in the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) an anion channel. How defects in this anion channel led to respiratory infections is unclear. To better understand CF lung disease we produced CF null pigs. CF pigs show host defense defects similar to humans. We found that CF pigs have an abnormally acidic airway surface liquid (ASL) the thin layer of fluid lining the lung epithelia. Increasing the pH of the ASL in CFpigs rescues the host defense defect. Thus we hypothesize that infections in CF are due to an acidic ASL pH in part by a dysfunctional CFTR which normally secretes HCO3-. In addition to CFTR a number of ion channels and transporters have been hypothesized to be involved in HCO3- secretion and H+ secretion. However which ion channels and transporters primarily contribute to ASL pH is unclear. If the dominant pathways can be identified the most efficacious pharmacological therapy to increase ASL pH and presumably decrease lung infections can be developed. To accomplish this we propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the channels and transporters that secrete HCO3- into the ASL 2) Determine the primary mechanism of H+ secretion into the ASL. To determine which HCO3--secreting and which H+-secreting proteins are most important we will use small interfering RNA (siRNA) to selectively knock down specific mRNAs and pharmacologic agents to inhibit ion channels and transporters. We will measure the effect of inhibiting these proteins on ASL pH in airway epithelia. We will quantify this effect using three techniques: pH sensitive fluorophores Ussing chamber electrophysiology and pH stat. By dispersing a pH sensitive fluorophore into the ASL we can measure the effects of on ASL pH directly. In Ussing Chambers we will voltage-clamp cultures to measure electrogenic HCO3- transport generated by pharmacologic stimulus. To account for electro-neutral ion transport we will use pH stat to pH-clamp and measure rates of H+ or HCO3- secretion. We expect that with these techniques we will identify which proteins contribute most to HCO3- secretion and H+ secretion into the ASL. We will then test the effects on CF host defense defects in vitro by measuring bacterial killing and ASL viscosity. Knowing which proteins are the major contributors to ASL pH is the first step towards our long-term goal of developing drugs to increase ASL pH. Using our access to CF pigs we can test the drugs in vivo and then develop them as therapies for humans. These drugs would have a major impact for not only CF but also for other diseases like COPD which also show acidic ASL and bacterial infections. This project is a direct application of understanding a physiology mechanism to better human health the mission of NHLBI.","Accounting;Acidity;Acids;Affect;Animal Model;Anions;Apical;Bacteria;Bacterial Infections;Bicarbonates;Cell Culture Techniques;Chronic;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Cyclic AMP;Cystic Fibrosis;Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator;Data;Defect;Disease;Drug Targeting;Electrophysiology (science);Epithelial Cells;Epithelium;Family suidae;Fellowship;Genes;Goals;H(+)-K(+)-Exchanging ATPase;Health;Host Defense;Human;In Vitro;Infection;Innovative Therapy;Ion Channel;Ion Transport;Killings;Laboratories;Lead;Liquid substance;Lung;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Mission;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mutation;National Heart Lung and Blood Institute;Ouabain;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Physiology;Play;Proteins;Pulmonary Cystic Fibrosis;Quality of life;RNA Interference;Reporting;Respiratory Tract Infections;Role;Small Interfering RNA;Stimulus;Stomach;Surface;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Titrations;Translating;Viscosity;Work;airway epithelium;airway surface liquid;antimicrobial;base;clinically relevant;cystic fibrosis airway;direct application;drug testing;expectation;fluorophore;in vivo;knock-down;mortality;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;pre-doctoral;public health relevance;vacuolar H+-ATPase;voltage clamp","Mechanisms Controlling Airway Surface Liquid pH","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Respiratory infections are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in CF and COPD.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the best strategies to understand how a particular protein drives a biological process is to first find its interacting proteins. Current methods to identify the repertoire of protein interactors suffer from multiple limitations. Most methods to identify protein-protein interactions are biased in favor of high affinity interactions between abundant partners. They also lack an easy way to compare the interactome between two different proteins or versions of a particular protein. The goal here is to further develop a new method termed DEEPN (Dynamic Enrichment for Evaluation of Protein Networks) as a means to define stable and transient conformationally sensitive binding interactions. We believe that DEEPN circumvents many of the shortcomings associated with other methods. DEEPN is innovative in that it utilizes next-generation high- throughput DNA sequencing approaches to quantitatively follow the evolution of a population of plasmids that encode interacting partners ina yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assay format. Our preliminary studies with DEEPN showed it to be robust and information rich when applied to finding factors that interact with particular proteins f interest. An important strength of DEEPN is that it can discover ""differential interactomes"" that being the repertoire of proteins that bind one conformation of a protein vs another. We propose to develop DEEPN into an exportable workflow that can be used by novice labs needing a method for comprehensive identification of low- and high-affinity interactions. DEEPN would be a boon for any research program focused on finding out how activated proteins (e.g. Kinases GTPases phosphorylated effectors) differentially interact with downstream protein partners. It would also help researchers determine the biochemical basis of disease- causing point mutations with the rationale that some of these types of changes might change the repertoire of protein interactions (or the strength of those interactions). Ultimately DEEPN could address the pressing need for a comprehensive technique to find specific protein interactions that is not only inexpensive but also customizable adaptable and accessible to RO1-driven labs.","Address;Adopted;Affinity;Bar Codes;Basic Science;Behavior;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Bioinformatics;Biological;Biological Assay;Biological Process;Biomedical Research;Cellular biology;Complementary DNA;Computers;Data;Disease;Evaluation;Evolution;Genes;Goals;Growth;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Health;High-Throughput DNA Sequencing;Hybrids;Individual;Libraries;Maps;Methods;Molecular;Molecular Conformation;Monitor;Pathway interactions;Phosphotransferases;Plasmids;Point Mutation;Population;Proteins;Protocols documentation;Reading;Reagent;Research;Research Infrastructure;Research Personnel;Resources;Running;Statistical Algorithm;Sum;Surveys;System;Techniques;Ubiquitin;Uncertainty;Yeasts;base;computer program;deep sequencing;improved;innovation;insight;interest;next generation;programs;protein function;protein protein interaction;success;wiki","DEEPN strategy for large-scale differential protein interaction studies","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying protein interaction networks is critical to progress in basic and biomedical research in molecular cell biology.

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Estrogen; Genetics","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The TFAP2C/AP-2 transcription factor regulates the expression of a number of key genes that control oncogenesis and progression in breast cancer. Amplification of the TFAP2C gene locus is common in cancer and overexpression of TFAP2C is associated with a worse clinical outcome. TFAP2C regulates the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERa)-associated genes including the RET proto-oncogene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) which is expressed more commonly in ERa-positive luminal breast cancers. Our recent findings identified RET as a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer. Ligand-activated RET regulates cell growth through the activation of multiple signaling pathways including the MAP kinase/ERK and PI3 kinase/Akt pathways. Knockdown of RET expression or treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with anti-RET activity such as sunitinib or vandetanib induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Whereas anti-estrogens block proliferation (measured by S-phase or Ki-67) anti-RET therapy induces apoptosis (measured by cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) or TUNEL) with combination therapy resulting in greater response than either alone. Furthermore blocking RET activity can increase sensitivity to anti-estrogens and has the potential to induce hormone response in hormone unresponsive breast cancers. The response of primary breast cancers to TKI is dependent upon RET expression indicating that RET may be used as a marker to predict therapeutic response to TKI therapy. The expression of EGFR is also regulated by TFAP2C and recent evidence suggests that in some breast cancers TKIs with activity against both RET and EGFR such as vandetanib may offer greater clinical effectiveness. We hypothesize that RET is a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer therapy; we further hypothesize that EGFR may cooperate with RET and co-targeting these RTKs may be effective in breast cancer. We propose to further the development of RET and potentially EGFR as therapeutic targets in breast cancer. Mechanisms regulating the expression of RET will be elucidated by examining the role of epigenetic chromatin modifications co-factor interaction and post-translational modification of TFAP2C as potential mechanisms controlling RET expression in breast cancer. We will examine the cooperative effects of RET and EGFR mediating responsiveness to vandetanib in a panel of primary breast cancer isolates and establish a correlation between expression of RET and/or EGFR and vandetanib response as determined by ERK activation. To establish further clinical relevance we propose an IRB-approved clinical trial utilizing a two- week preoperative therapy window with vandetanib to establish a correlation between RET expression and response to vandetanib as determined by changes in the surrogate molecular markers Ki-67 CC3 and TUNEL. The overall impact of the studies will create a new paradigm in breast cancer directed therapy by establishing RET as a therapeutic target in breast cancer.","1-Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase;Apoptosis;Breast Cancer Cell;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer therapy;CASP3 gene;Cleaved cell;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Clinical effectiveness;Combined Modality Therapy;Data;Development;ESR1 gene;Effectiveness;Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor;Epigenetic Process;Estrogen Antagonists;Estrogen Receptor alpha;FRAP1 gene;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Genes;Health;Hormones;In Situ Nick-End Labeling;Institutional Review Boards;Ligands;MEKs;Malignant Neoplasms;Measures;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Target;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Placebos;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Proteins;Proto-Oncogenes;Randomized;Randomized Clinical Trials;Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases;Regulation;Resistance;Role;S Phase;Signal Pathway;TFAP2A gene;TFAP2C gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Tumor Markers;Tumor Tissue;Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor;base;cell growth;chromatin modification;clinically relevant;hormone resistance;hormone therapy;inhibitor/antagonist;knock-down;malignant breast neoplasm;molecular marker;new therapeutic target;novel;overexpression;pre-clinical;prospective;response;therapeutic target;transcription factor;treatment response;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis","RET as a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Although hormonal therapy is effective in treating patients with ER-positive breast cancer approximately one- third of patients with ER-positive tumors do not respond or develop hormone resistance.

"Autism; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Biotechnology; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Genetics; Human Genome; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Mental Health; Pediatric; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spoken language is a near universal feature of human behavior that binds individuals into social groups and provides vital tools for interpersonal interaction learning problem solving and commerce. Most children acquire the spoken language of their community quickly and with little conscious effort on their part or on the part of their caregivers. However not all children accomplish this with equal success. Language impairment (LI) one contributor to this societal problem is a neurodevelopmental condition that leads to linguistic deficits in children where development is otherwise normal (i.e. other conditions such as autism or hearing impairment have been ruled out). LI can have profound and lasting effects on social relations employment and mental health. LI is known to have a substantial genetic component but the technologies used in the past decade of genetic research have only been able to implicate a few specific genes. We propose to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to produce the most comprehensive catalog to date of genetic variation in language impaired and language proficient individuals (aim 1). Using this catalog we will use computational approaches to infer the most likely functional impact for each genetic variant. These putatively functional variants will be grouped together into pathways and gene sets for which there is a plausible role in LI and we will test (aim 2) for enrichment of functionl genetic variation in cases (language impaired) vs. controls (language proficient). Furthermore we will investigate the role of potentially functional non-coding genetic variation by using a nove test for positional enrichment of genetic variation near regulatory landmarks such as genomic binding sites of the language-associated transcription factor FOXP2. Finally we will test the hypothesis that LI shares a genetic basis with the language deficits present in some individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This will be accomplished through performing a gene network analysis that looks for regions of concentrated genetic burden of functional variants (network modules). Modules based on LI genetic variants will be compared with modules based on ASD variants in terms of the significance of their proximity and overlap. This analysis will further illuminate on a molecular level the relationship between these conditions that share some similar clinical features. This project has the potential to transform the genetics of LI and illuminate its underlying biology and connection to other neurodevelopmental conditions. We will gain a more concrete understanding of any shared genetic liability between LI and ASD. Further this would be the first LI genetics study to use WGS with the goal of an integrated analysis of all major modes of genetic variation (single nucleotide variants indels and structura variants) while capturing the full frequency spectrum - rare and common alleles alike. By increasing our understanding of the genes at play in LI we will move closer to being able to use genetic findings as evidence to support early interventions for improved outcomes.      ","Address;Adult;Affect;Alleles;Autistic Disorder;Behavior;Binding;Binding Sites;Biological;Biology;Caregivers;Cataloging;Catalogs;Child;Child Development;Clinical;Code;Commerce;Communication impairment;Communities;Conscious;Copy Number Polymorphism;Data;Diagnosis;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Employment;FOXP2 gene;Frequencies;Gene Cluster;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Research;Genetic study;Genome;Genomic approach;Genomics;Goals;Human;Individual;Interpersonal Relations;Iowa;Knowledge;Language;Language Disorders;Learning;Linguistics;Mental Health;Methods;Molecular;Neurobiology;Nucleotides;Other Genetics;Pathway Analysis;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Play;Positioning Attribute;Prevalence;Problem Solving;Psychiatry;Quantitative Trait Loci;Recruitment Activity;Research;Resolution;Role;Sampling;Science;Seasons;Technology;Testing;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Variation (Genetics);autism spectrum disorder;base;career;clinical phenotype;cohort;developmental disease/disorder;experience;genetic variant;genome sequencing;genome wide association study;hearing impairment;improved;improved outcome;insertion/deletion mutation;language impairment;literacy;member;neuropsychiatry;novel;public health relevance;risk variant;social;social group;success;tool;transcription factor;whole genome","Understanding the biology of language impairment through whole genome sequencing","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language impairment (LI) is the most common developmental disorder and it can persist well into adulthood contributing to poor literacy educational attainment and mental health.

"Atherosclerosis; Cardiovascular","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The function of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) remains poorly understood in the vasculature. Our data suggest that CaMKII is instrumental in mediating neointima formation and remodeling after vascular injury. Neointima formation and remodeling occur in vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass surgery after balloon angioplasty and surgical endarterectomy and have a significant impact in terms of morbidity and health care cost. Our long-term goal is to study the function of CaMKII in the vasculature specifically CaMKII modulation as new approach to treat vascular injury. The objective of this application is to determine how CaMKII is activated in injury directy test whether CaMKII inhibition will confer disease resistance in vascular injury and delineate the dependance of VSMC migration and proliferation upon the oxidative activation of CaMKII. The central hypothesis of this application is that CaMKII is activated by oxidation of Met281/282 in vascular injury and that oxidative activation of CaMKII is necessary for neointimal hyperplasia VSMC proliferation and migration. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data that CaMKII is essential in neointima formation and remodeling after injury. Oxidized CaMKII (ox-CaMKII) is readily detected in the neointima after vascular injury. In addition we have compelling evidence that key activators in the response to injury induce ox-CaMKII in vitro. The rationale of the proposed research is that understanding how CaMKII is activated after vascular injury has the potential to translate into better strategies to prevent the deleterious effects after vascular injry. Guided by strong preliminary data the central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1)Dissect the mechanisms of CaMKII activation in vascular injury in vivo; 2) Determine the role of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) the enzyme that controls the balance between active ox-CaMKII and reduced inactive CaMKII in the response to injury; 3) Dissect the mechanisms of CaMKII activation in VSMC migration proliferation in vitro. In the first aim a novel in vivo model will be used to test if the blockade of oxidative CaMKII activation is sufficient to abrogatethe response to injury. Under aim 2 we will define whether MsrA can modulate neointimal hyperplasia through ox-CaMKII. In aim 3 we will delineate how CaMKII is activated by key cytokines and growth factors relevant for vascular injury in vitro and how the activation pathways correlate with VSMC migration and proliferation.

Impaired cognitive function compromises dentally-related function (DRF) (e.g making treatment decisions performing oral hygiene care and following homecare instructions) remarkably increasing risk of dental caries periodontal disease and other oral health issues. Poor oral health is associated with diabetes and increases risk of cardiovascular disease and recurrent respiratory infection the leading causes of death in special-needs patients. Currently due to the lack of a reliable and practical methodology DRF assessment is not a standard part of dental assessment and treatment planning. This fact likely affects quality of care and increases the risk of avoidable complications. In response to this unmet need Dr. Xi Chen (PI) proposes a career development plan to develop an instrument to assess DRF in cognitively-impaired patients. Dr. Chen is one of the few fellowship-trained geriatric dentists with a substantial grounding in research. He completed his geriatric dentistry fellowship and PhD training in Health Informatics at the University of Minnesota and started his career as an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) in 2008. His unique background in geriatric dentistry gerontology and clinical research together with a strong passion and sense of professional responsibility to advance the field of geriatric dentistry make him an outstanding candidate for this award. In the past three years UNC-CH has provided start-up funds protected time and other excellent support for Dr. Chen which enabled him to formulate a multidisciplinary mentoring team and complete a number of preliminary studies to conceptualize and test the hypotheses of the proposed studies. A prototype instrument has also been developed and is now ready for further testing. All of these elements have prepared Dr. Chen to become an independent investigator in geriatric dental research. The proposed career development plan includes supervised study and mentored research that will augment Dr. Chen's previous training complement his proposed research and develop the expertise needed to foster his transition to being an independent geriatric dental researcher. The proposed training plan consists of didactics (e.g. cognitive neuroscience cognitive function assessment and measurement design epidemiology and statistics) clinical and research seminars and supervised clinical rotation in the UNC neurology clinic. During this award Dr. Chen will meet with his mentors once every other week to discuss the proposed research training and other career development issues. These training activities aim to help Dr. Chen: A) develop expertise in cognitive and functional assessment for cognitively-impaired patients; B) develop expertise in health measurement scale development and validation; and C) improve clinical research skills. Complementary to the training plan the mentored research plan aims to enhance Dr. Chen's clinical study skills and provide experience in patient-oriented dental research all of which is essential to achieving his long- term goal -- development of a new evidence-based dental care model for dementia patients. The proposed research plan is an essential step toward his long-term goal and can be divided into two phases. Phase I is to refine the proposed Dentally-related Function Test (DRF-Test) (Specific Aim 1). A prototype DRF-Test including 17 items has been developed by the PI through literature review and focus group discussions. Two content validity tests one with practicing geriatric dental experts and one with geriatric experts on cognitive/functional assessment and a field testing will be conducted. These results will be used to further refine the prototype instrument. The psychometric properties of the DRF-Test will be evaluated during Phase II (Specific Aim 2). The DRF-Test and standard cognitive/functional assessments will be administered to 200 participants with MCI or dementia. Factor analysis will be performed to examine the structure of the DRF-Test and eliminate redundant or poorly-performed items. The reliability and validity of the DRF-Test will be evaluated using the Classical Test Theory. As a part of the validation studies a subset of the study sample (N=125) will be randomly selected to receive oral health assessment focusing on oral hygiene status denture hygiene (if applicable) gum inflammation and dental caries prevalence. The association between oral health measures and DRF in cognitively-impaired patients will be examined to provide data required to develop evidence-based interventions for cognitively-impaired patients in a future study. The proposed study and training plans are expected to provide Dr. Chen with the skills and experience essential to developing as a patient oriented researcher in geriatric dentistry. This proposal will also result in a practical method to measure DRF leading to methods for incorporating these results into clinical assessment and treatment planning. Based on the results of this study a future evidence-based individualized oral health intervention protocol corresponding to patients' oral health needs DRF and level of caregiver support will be developed and tested in patients with MCI or dementia. After that a randomized control study will be conducted to evaluate how DRF-test and this evidence-based protocol may inform clinician's decision and improve clinical practice for cognitively-impaired patients. All of these are essential to achieving my long-term goal of developing a new evidence-based model of dementia dental care.","Address;Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Assessment tool;Award;Caregiver support;Caring;Cause of Death;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Treatment;Clinical assessments;Cognitive;Collaborations;Complement;Data;Dementia;Dental;Dental Care;Dental Hygiene;Dental Research;Dental caries;Dentists;Dentures;Development;Development Plans;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Doctor of Philosophy;Elderly;Elements;Environment;Epidemiology;Evidence based intervention;Factor Analysis;Fellowship;Focus Groups;Fostering;Funding;Future;Geriatric Assessment;Geriatric Dentistry;Gerontology;Gingiva;Goals;Health;Health Professional;Healthcare;Hygiene;Immune system;Impaired cognition;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Instruction;Insulin Resistance;Intervention;Knowledge;Lead;Literature;Malnutrition;Measurement;Measures;Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award;Mentors;Methodology;Methods;Minnesota;Modeling;Neurology;North Carolina;Nursing Homes;Oral;Oral health;Outcome;Participant;Pathology;Patients;Periodontal Diseases;Persons;Phase;Prevalence;Property;Protocols documentation;Psychometrics;Public Health;Public Health Informatics;Quality of Care;Quality of life;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recurrence;Research;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Training;Respiratory Tract Infections;Review Literature;Risk;Rotation;Sampling;Sampling Studies;Severities;Staging;Structure;Study Skills;Testing;Time;Tooth Loss;Training;Training Activity;Universities;Validation;Validity and Reliability;Visiting Nurse;Vulnerable Populations;aged;base;cardiovascular disorder risk;career;career development;clinical practice;cognitive function;cognitive neuroscience;cognitive testing;design;diabetic;effective intervention;evidence base;experience;field study;fighting;glycemic control;improved;instrument;loss of function;meetings;mild cognitive impairment;mortality;multidisciplinary;oral care;patient oriented;professor;prototype;response;skills;soft tissue;statistics;theories;tool;treatment planning;validation studies","Development and Validation of an Instrument to Assess Cognitive Function Regulati","The proposed research and training are relevant to public health because they will produce a validated practical method to assess dentally-related function in cognitively-impaired patients leading to improved quality of care for this vulnerable population.","NIDCR","9029312","4/11/2016","PA-11-194","5K23DE022470-04","5","K23","DE","022470","04","","KING, LYNN M","5/1/2015","4/30/2018","National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Special Grants Review Committee[DSR]"," ","9827255","CHEN, XI ","Not Applicable","01","DENTISTRY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2016","4/30/2017"," ","121","Other Research-Related","2016","128287"," ","NIDCR","118784","9503"," ","128287",
"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Cancer; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Mind and Body; Neurosciences; Ovarian Cancer; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelial ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecologic cancer. Because of poor survival for the majority of ovarian cancer patients identification of factors contributing to disease progression is of utmost importance. Although a significant percentage of ovarian cancer patients respond well to initial chemotherapy the success of treatment is limited by the development of chemo resistance and the majority of patients relapse and die from recurrent disease. Our previous work has shown a variety of mechanisms by which biobehavioral factors (referring collectively to behavioral social and/or psychological factors and concomitant biologic processes) can directly affect key biological signaling mechanisms to enhance tumor growth and impair the immune response in ovarian cancer. Although the neuroendocrine stress hormones norepinephrine (NE) and cortisol have been shown to increase chemo resistance pre-clinically little is known about the contribution of psychological and social processes to chemo resistance in the clinical setting of ovarian cancer. Based on compelling preliminary pre-clinical data in ovarian cancer we propose that psychological and social processes and the neuroendocrine stress response will contribute to impairment of the chemotherapeutic response in ovarian cancer patients. Thus this grant will focus on mapping psychological and social and neuroendocrine influences on disease progression in 178 women with high grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer with particular attention to chemo resistance as a mechanism. This study is highly innovative as 1) contributions of biobehavioral processes to chemo resistance in human epithelial cell cancers in a clinical setting have not been examined and 2) this is the first translational study using exosomes (tumor derived vesicles in peripheral circulation) to examine relationships between biobehavioral factors and tumor dynamics. Use of the exosome biomarker approach will provide a longitudinal window on tumor characteristics not otherwise available in the absence of repeated surgery. If initial response to chemotherapy could be enhanced or maintained for a longer duration it could have substantial survival benefits. Thus findings that biobehavioral stress-related processes alter the response to chemotherapy would have significant implications for clinical management of ovarian patients specifically the potential for adjunct use of behavioral or pharmacological interventions to delay the development of chemo resistance. Because chemotherapeutic response is closely linked to ovarian cancer survival understanding biobehavioral impediments to maximum chemotherapeutic response is of great public health significance.      ","Adrenergic Agents;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Attention;Behavioral;Biological;Biological Markers;Biology;Blood Circulation;Breast;Cancer Patient;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell Death Signaling Process;Characteristics;Chronic;Chronic stress;Clinical;Clinical Data;Clinical Management;Colon;Development;Diagnosis;Disease Progression;Down-Regulation;Drug Transport;Elements;Epinephrine;Epithelial Cells;Epithelial ovarian cancer;Extracellular Matrix;Gene Expression;Genes;Grant;Hormones;Human;Hydrocortisone;Immune response;Impairment;Intervention;Link;Loneliness;Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of ovary;Maps;Measures;Mediator of activation protein;Neoplasm Metastasis;Neuroendocrine Tumors;Neurosecretory Systems;Norepinephrine;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Ovarian;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peripheral;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Platinum;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Progression-Free Survivals;Progressive Disease;Psychological Factors;Public Health;Recurrence;Recurrent disease;Relapse;Repeat Surgery;Research;Resistance;Resources;Risk Factors;Role;Serous;Signal Transduction;Social isolation;Social support;Specificity;Stress;Survival Rate;Testing;Time;Translating;Tumor Biology;Tumor Tissue;Tumor-Derived;Up-Regulation;Vesicle;Woman;Work;advanced disease;base;behavior influence;biobehavior;biological adaptation to stress;blood-based biomarker;cancer survival;chemotherapy;cohort;depressive symptoms;epithelial to mesenchymal transition;exosome;genomic signature;innovation;neoplastic cell;novel;ovarian neoplasm;peripheral blood;pre-clinical;proteomic signature;psychologic;public health relevance;relapse patients;resilience;response;restraint stress;social;success;translational study;tumor;tumor growth;tumor progression","Behavioral Influences on Ovarian Cancer Progression: Role of Chemoresistance","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although many ovarian cancer patients respond well to initial chemotherapy the majority develop chemo resistance relapse and die from recurrent disease.

"Genetics","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)   RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation control has emerged as a critical control point for metazoan gene expression. Promoter proximal pausing occurs at most human promoters and maintains an open promoter configuration allowing rapid response to regulatory signals. Pausing is a complex process controlled by negative elongation factors that include DSIF NELF Gdown1 and GNAF and by the first nucleosome encountered. Overcoming block to elongation and subsequent mRNA production requires the kinase activity of P-TEFb. Although many of the negative factors have been identified mechanisms orchestrating the synchronized exchange of factors required for the transition from initiation through pausing and into productive elongation have yet to be elucidated. Our preliminary experiments using a novel inhibitor of the essential cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk7 have revealed critical unanticipated roles for Cdk7 kinase activity in early events in Pol II elongation in vitro. The Cdk7 inhibitor (THZ1) was developed in Nathanael Gray's lab (Harvard) for use as an anti-cancer therapy. Cdk7 kinase activity has long been known to be important for phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of Pol II. We have shown that in addition to inhibiting CTD phosphorylation THZ1 blocks capping in an unanticipated way significantly alters the pattern of transcripts resulting from promoter proximal pausing and almost completely abrogates P-TEFb-dependent productive elongation. Our overall goal is to elucidate the mechanisms driving the ordered early events controlling the elongation properties of Pol II. We propose to dissect Pol IItranscription by determining the steps in early elongation that require Cdk7 activity or are abrogated by THZ1 and to learn how factors compete for Pol II to control its elongation properties. We plan to examine this process by determining how CTD phosphorylation is coupled to capping and how the known pausing factors and the +1 nucleosome collaborate to enable the P-TEFb-dependent transition into productive elongation. This proposal combines the resources of the Luse and Price labs which each have decades of experience with in vitro transcription systems. The synergy of these two groups results from the extensive expertise using factor-rich extract systems (Price Lab) and sophisticated reconstituted in vitro systems (Luse Lab) for the dissection of transcription mechanisms.      ","Address;Affect;Automobile Driving;Biochemical;Biogenesis;Biological Assay;C-terminal;Cells;ChIP-seq;Complex;Coupled;Cyclin-Dependent Kinases;Dissection;Enhancers;Enzymes;Evaluation;Event;Gene Expression;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Gray unit of radiation dose;Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors;Human;In Vitro;Kinetics;Learning;Light;Location;Mediating;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Nucleosomes;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Peptide Elongation Factor 1;Phase;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Play;Polymerase;Positioning Attribute;Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B;Price;Process;Production;Properdin;Property;RNA Polymerase II;Regulation;Resources;Role;Signal Transduction;System;Testing;Transcript;anti-cancer therapeutic;cancer therapy;experience;flavopiridol;genome-wide analysis;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;kinase inhibitor;mRNA capping;negative elongation factor;new technology;novel;promoter;public health relevance;reconstitution;research study;response;transcription factor","Coordination of early events in RNA polymerase II elongation control","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The proposed studies will shed light on the basic mechanisms involved in controlling the elongation phase of transcription and further our understanding of the role of Cdk7 in this process.

"Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Genetics; Injury (total) Accidents/Adverse Effects; Pediatric","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Every time an incision is made a wound is created. Over 70 million surgeries were performed in the United States in 2000 with over 50% requiring postsurgical wound care. In addition chronic wounds affect 6.5 million patients with over $25 billion spent annually on treatment. The economic and social impact of wound healing to our society requires further research to better understand the mechanisms regulating tissue repair. In previous studies we have shown that genetic variations in Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) identify individuals at risk for poor healing outcome suggesting that IRF6 is a novel transcriptional regulator of tissue repair. We have evidence that both downregulation and upregulation of Irf6 in the mouse alter different aspects of tissue repair suggesting that the proper homeostasis of Irf6 is required for adequate healing. Furthermore Irf6-deficient keratinocytes are impaired in their ability to close an in vitro scratch wound. These keratinocytesare larger more round and exhibit more stress fibers and increased RhoA activity compared with wild-type cells. Arhgap29 a RhoA-specific activating protein is upregulated during wound healing and is downregulated in Irf6-deficient tissues making it a perfect downstream effector. Although it is clear that IRF6 expression is important for normal wound healing essentially nothing is known about its cellular or molecular mechanism of action. The overall goal of this study is to take advantage of our unique murine and patient cells in combination with unique murine models to elucidate how IRF6 contributes to tissue repair. We hypothesize that IRF6 regulates epidermal migration by inhibiting RhoA GTPase through Arhgap29. We propose two aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Identify the mechanism of IRF6-dependent keratinocyte migration and 2) Determine how ARHGAP29 mediates the function of IRF6. The successful completion of this project will establish the contribution of IRF6 in tissue repair and provide a basis for identifying therapeutic targets involved in wound healing.      ","Actins;Adhesions;Adult;Affect;Behavior;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Caring;Cell Adhesion;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Line;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Cicatrix;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Code;Collection;Cutaneous;Data;Defect;Down-Regulation;E-Cadherin;Embryo;Enhancers;Exhibits;Funding;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases;Healed;Health;Homeostasis;In Vitro;Individual;Infection prevention;Inflammatory Response;Injury;Interferons;Large Keratinocyte;Mediating;Modality;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Null Lymphocytes;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Phase;Phenotype;Play;Point Mutation;Process;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Regulation;Research;Risk;Role;Shapes;Single Nucleotide Polymorphism;Skin;Skin injury;Social Impacts;Societies;Stress Fibers;Surgical incisions;Syndrome;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Transcriptional Regulation;United States;Up-Regulation;Van der Woude syndrome;Variant;Variation (Genetics);Wound Healing;base;cell behavior;cell motility;cell type;chronic wound;cost;craniofacial development;economic impact;healing;human tissue;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;interest;keratinocyte;migration;mouse model;novel;orofacial cleft;public health relevance;repaired;research study;therapeutic target;tissue repair;transcription factor;wound","IRF6 and Wound Healing","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Relevance to Public Health This proposal will evaluate the role of Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 in cutaneous wound healing a major cause of rising health-related costs.

"Diabetes; Digestive Diseases; Liver Disease","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Before entering the canonical gluconeogenic pathway the vast majority of gluconeogenic carbon flux is routed through the TCA cycle within the mitochondrial matrix. Under normal conditions mitochondrial pyruvate is the key metabolic intermediate supporting gluconeogenesis. To reach the matrix and drive gluconeogenesis pyruvate requires a specific carrier the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier (MPC). Thus the MPC occupies a central node linking cytosolic with mitochondrial metabolism and gluconeogenesis. The mechanisms regulating the function of the MPC in the liver have remained unexplained. The recent identification of the MPC molecule now enables the investigation of these mechanisms. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the relationship between MPC function in the liver and the pathologically elevated gluconeogenesis during T2D. This goal will be addressed by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanisms that regulate liver MPC function in response to fasting and refeeding and in T2D states; and 2) Determine the therapeutic effect of decreasing Liver MPC activity on hyperglycemia during T2D states. The studies in aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the MPC is transcriptionally and post-translationall regulated by hormonal mechanisms during fasting and refeeding that increase and decrease MPC activity respectively and that misregulation of the MPC in T2D states increases its activity thereby increasing mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and gluconeogenesis. The studies in aim 2 will test the hypothesis that decreasing liver MPC activity in vivo during T2D states will decreasegluconeogenesis and ameliorate hyperglycemia. They will also define how liver-specific MPC knockout alters gluconeogenic and TCA cycle carbon flux using metabolic tracers in normal and T2D mice and primary hepatocytes. This research is significant because successful completion will provide fundamental information on the role of the MPC in driving elevated hepatic gluconeogenesis and resultant hyperglycemia in T2D. This research is innovative because completion will generate novel and now only recently obtainable knowledge on the regulation and function of the MPC molecule as a critical node linking cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism with gluconeogenesis. We expect our studies will unveil a new paradigm for explaining and potentially decreasing the excessive gluconeogenesis that characterizes T2D.","Address;Automobile Driving;Blood Glucose;Carbon;Citric Acid Cycle;Cytoplasm;Data;Diffuse;Fasting;Glucagon;Gluconeogenesis;Glucose;Goals;Health;Hepatocyte;High Fat Diet;Hormonal;Hyperglycemia;Inner mitochondrial membrane;Investigation;Knock-out;Knowledge;Link;Liver;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mission;Mitochondria;Mitochondrial Matrix;Molecular;Mus;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Outer Mitochondrial Membrane;Oxaloacetates;Oxidative Phosphorylation;Pathway interactions;Phosphoenolpyruvate;Protons;Public Health;Pyruvate;Pyruvate Carboxylase;Regulation;Research;Role;Source;Testing;Therapeutic Effect;Tracer;base;glucose production;hepatic gluconeogenesis;in vivo;innovation;insulin sensitivity;mitochondrial membrane;mitochondrial metabolism;novel;paralogous gene;pyruvate carrier;response;stoichiometry;uptake","Regulation of Hepatic Gluconeogenesis by the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the major public health issue of high blood sugar during Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by investigating the relationship between mitochondrial pyruvate carrier function and glucose production by the liver.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aging; Alzheimer's Disease; Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD); Alzheimer's Disease including Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD); Brain Disorders; Dementia; Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 20% of those over the age of 75 and 50% over the age of 85. It is difficult to identify early stages of AD and there are no methods to quantitatively follow disease progression. Therapies to slow AD or to cure AD are also absent. One of the neuropathological features of AD is the neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. The discovery of mutations in the tau gene that cause age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia has led to research showing that (1) abnormally phosphorylated tau is sufficient to cause disease and (2) neuronal death is caused by abnormal tau. Moreover AD is now considered a ""tauopathy"". To discover new biomarkers and therapeutics for AD and other tauopathies it is critical to determine how tau causes disease. While many investigators have focused in the well-known property of tau as a microtubule-associated protein we have focused on identifying new properties for tau as there are many microtubule-associated proteins that have no connection to AD. We have found that tau associates with Src-family non-receptor tyrosine kinases and is tyrosine phosphorylated. We have also found that tau can up-regulate kinase activity and that both abnormally phosphorylated and mutated forms of tau can associate more strongly with Fyn a Src-family kinase. In fact other investigators have shown that deleting Fyn is neuroprotective forAD in mouse models. Because tau is tyrosine phosphorylated we investigated the possibility that tau might function as a signal transduction protein. We found that tau potentiated NGF-induced MAPK and AP1 activation in neuronal cells and that phosphorylation of tau at thr231 and tyr18/tyr29 were critical for this new property. Microtubule binding was not involved. In addition we found that tau associated with the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 in an NGF-dependent manner. In this application we propose to investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation of tau using two approaches. In Specific Aim I we will determine if deletion of Fyn from a tauopathy mouse model alters the tau pathology and neuronal viability in the model. We will also determine if the behavior of the mouse is altered. In Specific Aim II we will investigate thefunction of abnormally phosphorylated tau. Specifically we will investigate the role of phosphorylation in the interaction between tau and SHP2 as well as the functional significance of the interaction. In Specific Aim III we will determine if SHP2 is activated in AD. SHP2 and MAPK activation will also be investigated in a mouse tauopathy model.

"Cancer; Colo-Rectal Cancer; Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Dietary Supplements; Digestive Diseases; Nutrition; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiological studies reveal vitamin D-insufficient individuals with low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D the major circulating form of the vitamin are at increased risk of developing colon cancer. Growth of colon cancer cells in vitro is inhibited by supraphysiologic doses of the active hormonal form of vitamin D 125-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Unfortunately doses of 125-dihydroxyvitamin D3 that might treat colon tumors in vivo also stimulate the vitamin's classic effects on calcium homeostasis resulting in hypercalcemia. Our previously funded grant explored whether a glucuronide of 125-dihydroxyvitamin D3 could deliver the hormone directly to the colon to prevent tumor growth while reducing the risk of a hypercalcemic response. Conjugating a glucuronide to vitamin D molecules in a -linkage renders it biologically inactive and resistant to mammalian digestive enzymes. Upon reaching the lower intestinal tract -glucuronidase enzymes produced by resident bacteria cleave off the glucuronide and liberate the vitamin D molecule. Despite evidence that prolonged treatment with 125-dihydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide was regulating gene expression almost exclusively in the lower intestine without causing hypercalcemia; our data reveal the treatment was unable to slow tumor growth in either of two murine colon cancer models tested. However in CD1 mice treated with azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide included as a negative control yielded a ca. 60% reduction in colon tumor load with no hypercalcemia. This treatment also increased expression of vitamin D-dependent genes in the colon. Our renewal proposal focuses on exploring the ability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide to prevent the growth of or treat existing colorectal tumors. Aim 1 will mirror our earlier study using CD1 mice fed a Western-style diet but we will now titrate and contrast different levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide compared to 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 to determine doses required to inhibit colon tumor growth. Aim 2 will assess dietary 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in the same CD1 mouse model when treatment is delayed and the compounds are used on already developed colon tumors. Data from the prior grant period revealed the unexpected finding that 25- hydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide is able to suppress colon tumor growth alter colon gene expression and not induce hypercalcemia. The current proposal will provide much-needed basic information on the therapeutic potential of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 glucuronide to slow the growth of or treat colon tumors. We are testing the possibility that studies linking low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D with colon cancer are the result of a direct effect of 25-hydroxyvitamin D on colon cells independent of being a precursor to 125-dihydroxyvitamin D.      ","25-hydroxyvitamin D;Animal Model;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;ApcMin/+ mice;Apoptotic;Azoxymethane;Bacteria;Beta-glucuronidase;Bile fluid;Binding;Blood;Calcifediol;Calcium;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Model;Cell Proliferation;Cells;Cessation of life;Cleaved cell;Colon;Colon Carcinoma;Colonic Neoplasms;Colorectal Cancer;Colorectal Neoplasms;Data;Development;Diet;Dihydroxycholecalciferols;Dose;Duodenum;Ensure;Enzymes;Epidemiologic Studies;Event;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fiber;Funding;Gastrointestinal tract structure;Gene Expression;Genes;Glucuronides;Grant;Growth;Health;Homeostasis;Hormonal;Hormones;Hypercalcemia;In Vitro;Individual;Intestines;Life;Link;Liver;Mus;Phase;Prodrugs;Property;Relative Risks;Resistance;Risk;Risk Factors;Serum;Sodium Dextran Sulfate;Testing;Therapeutic;Thinking;Titrations;Tumor Burden;United States;Vitamin D;Vitamin D3 Receptor;Vitamins;cancer cell;cancer diagnosis;cancer risk;feeding;in vivo;jejunum;mouse model;prevent;public health relevance;research study;response;sugar;targeted delivery;trial comparing;tumor;tumor growth;tumorigenesis","Using vitamin D glucuronide pro-drugs to prevent/treat colon cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Project Narrative  This proposal will evaluate whether a glucuronide form of 25-hydroxyvitamin D that targets release of the vitamin specifically to the lower gut is better able to suppress the formation or growth of tumors compared to unconjugated 25-hydroxyvitamin D in a mouse model of sporadic colon cancer.

"Brain Disorders; Cerebrovascular; Neurosciences; Stroke","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is an urgent need to improve upon the safety and treatment window of current stroke therapies. Mitochondria play key roles during both early (minutes) and late (days) stages of ischemic brain injury and are thus recognized as promising targets for neuroprotective therapy. Mitochondrial architecture as determined by opposing fission and fusion reactions has recently emerged as a critical determinant for survival of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Mitochondrial fission catalyzed by the mechanoenzyme dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) facilitates cytochrome C release and apoptosis. In addition mitochondria fragment during stroke and pathological Drp1 activation occurs in neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand we and others have shown that fusion of mitochondria into an interconnected network has a neuroprotective effect which may involve increased energy production ROS and calcium sequestration and sparing of the organelle from autophagic degradation. Despite the widely appreciated disease relevance of mitochondrial dynamics our understanding of regulatory mechanisms controlling mitochondrial architecture is still in its infancy. In the previous funding cycle we identified a pivotal phosphorylation site i Drp1. Conserved in all metazoans S656 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) to inhibit the fission enzyme leading to unopposed fusion of mitochondria. Opposite PKA is the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) which dephosphorylates S656 to promote mitochondrial fragmentation. Phospho-Drp1 protects from while dephospho-Drp1 sensitizes PC12 cells to apoptosis. We also uncovered a potent neuroprotective activity of mitochondria-localized A kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) in hippocampal neurons which is mediated by Drp1 phosphorylation at S656 and stabilization of the mitochondrial network. Intriguingly a PKA binding- deficient AKAP1 mutant fragmented mitochondria suggesting that some of the signaling molecules reported to also associate with AKAP1 may oppose mitochondrial stabilization by PKA. We propose to continue with this line of inquiry in three specific aims (SA).In SA1 we will characterize AKAP1 knockout mice for changes in mitochondrial morphology bioenergetics Drp1 phosphorylation and injury severity following focal ischemia. SA2 examines the role of AKAP1-interacting protein phosphatases (PP1 CaN) in mitochondrial remodeling and neuronal survival. Finally SA3 proposes to elucidate molecular mechanisms of CaN recruitment to Drp1 in calcium-mediated mitochondrial fission and ischemic death. The proposal addresses the overall hypothesis that AKAP1 assembles a signalosome at the outer mitochondrial membrane which integrates death and survival signals from the cytosol and from within mitochondria to restructure the organelle via reversible phosphorylation of Drp1 at S656. The proposed studies will increase our mechanistic understanding of mitochondrial fragmentation and its regulation by reversible phosphorylation in neurons which may lead to better therapies for neurodegeneration in stroke and disease.","A kinase anchoring protein;Address;Apoptosis;Architecture;Binding;Bioenergetics;Biological Assay;Brain;Brain region;Buffers;Calcineurin;Calcium;Cessation of life;Complex;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Cytochromes;Cytosol;Disease;Docking;Dynamin;Enzymes;Funding;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Injury;Ischemia;Ischemic Brain Injury;Ischemic Stroke;Knockout Mice;Lead;Maps;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolism;Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion;Mitochondria;Molecular;Morphology;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuroglia;Neurons;Organelles;Outer Mitochondrial Membrane;PC12 Cells;Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases;Phosphorylation;Phosphorylation Site;Phosphotransferases;Play;Production;Property;Protein Dephosphorylation;Protein phosphatase;Proteins;Reaction;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Reporting;Role;Safety;Severities;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Site;Staging;Testing;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;infancy;mutant;neuron loss;neuronal survival;neuroprotection;scaffold;stroke;stroke therapy;stroke treatment","Kinase/phosphatase-mediated Mitochondrial Restructuring in Neuroprotection","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mitochondria produce energy buffer calcium and are often dysregulated when the brain is damaged by disease or injury such as ischemic stroke.

"Cancer; Genetics; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application focuses on iron-sulfur containing (FeS) helicases a prominent DNA helicase family whose deficiency or dysregulation is linked to human diseases ranging from cancer predisposition to hypertension. In addition to the Superfamily II motor core FeS helicases possess two family specific auxiliary domains: an FeS cluster domain and an ARCH domain. The secondary DNA binding site formed with the help of the auxiliary domains which positions the helicase in an orientation to unwind duplex controls the helicase rate and verifies the integrity of the translocating strand. I propose that the frequency of ARCH domain opening and closing in FeS helicases modulates their activities. We will use this helicase family to test for the first time how the exogenous factors affect the mechano-chemistry of the helicases through modulating the frequency of its core and auxiliary domains motions. Our objective is to determine the mechanism by which the domain mobility controls the activities of three FeS helicases XPD FANCJ and RTEL1. To achieve this objective we will use a synergistic set of biochemical reconstitutions and novel single-molecule methodologies developed in my lab.  Aim 1: Determine the role of ARCH domain mobility in controlling XPD activities. We will build on our preliminary data showing that the cognate DNA lesions stabilize the closed conformation of the ARCH. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) we will observe domain motions of individual fluorescently labeled XPD molecules as they interact with DNA. We will learn how ARCH domain motions control activities of XPD helicase and its malfunction in disease.  Aim 2: Determine the role of ARCH domain mobility in FANCJ and RTEL1 mediated DNA unwinding and remodeling of G-quadruplexes. Upon completion of this aim we will learn how the helicase and G-quadruplex remodeling activities of FANCJ and RTEL1 correlate with ARCH domain motions. We will also learn how FANCJ mutations associated with breast cancer and Fanconi Anemia perturb FANCJ activities ARCH domain mobility and the ability to discriminate between damaged and damage-free DNA.  Aim 3: Determine how protein partners tune the activities of FANCJ and RTEL1. We will test the hypothesis that interactions with key protein partners (BRCA1 tumor suppressor protein hMLH1 mismatch repair protein and PCNA clamp) govern helicase and translocase activities by modifying domain mobility of FANCJ and RTEL1. Together the anticipated results of the three proposed aims will not only close the gaps in the mechanistic understanding of how helicases' distinct biochemical activities are regulated but also identify explicit strategies to selectively modulate them. This information will pave the way for the design of inhibitors of FANCJ or RTEL1 to be used to target specific aspects of cancer and aging related diseases.","ATP phosphohydrolase;Affect;Aging;Antineoplastic Agents;BRCA1 gene;Binding;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Cell physiology;Chemistry;Complex;DNA;DNA Binding;DNA Damage;DNA Maintenance;DNA Repair;DNA Structure;DNA lesion;Data;Defect;Diagnosis;Disease;Drug Targeting;Enzymes;Exogenous Factors;Family;Fanconi&apos;s Anemia;Fluorescence Microscopy;Foundations;Frequencies;G-Quartets;Generations;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomic Instability;HDAC1 gene;Health;Hereditary Disease;Human Activities;Hypertension;Individual;Iron;Label;Learning;Life;Link;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Methodology;Mismatch Repair;Molecular Conformation;Molecular Motors;Motion;Motor;Mutation;Nucleoproteins;Nucleotide Excision Repair;Positioning Attribute;Predisposition;Process;Progeria;Proteins;Regulation;Role;Site;Sulfur;Symptoms;Testing;Time;Trichothiodystrophy;Tumor Suppressor Proteins;age related;design;genome integrity;helicase;human disease;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;malignant breast neoplasm;mutant;novel;protein protein interaction;reconstitution;single molecule;synthetic construct;targeted treatment;translocase","Regulation of unwinding and remodeling activities in FeS-DNA helicases","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A synergistic set of biochemical reconstitutions and innovative single-molecule methodologies will be employed to decipher the role of domain dynamics in the activities and regulation of DNA helicases the molecular motors of DNA repair and maintenance machines.

"Aging; Biotechnology; Clinical Research; Genetics; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing loss affects 15-26% of the world's population and among the elderly is the most common neurological disability. Although the relative contributions of hereditary and environmental factors to age- related hearing loss are unknown the majority of inherited late-onset deafness is autosomal dominant and non-syndromic (autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss ADNSHL). The long-term goals of our research are: a) to identify ADNSHL-causing genes to address gaps in our understanding of the molecular biology of hearing and deafness in the elderly; and b) to explore novel habilitation options for hearing loss.  During the prior granting period we focused on specific aims to: 1) localize and clone genes that cause ADNSHL; 2) expand phenotype-genotype studies to facilitate gene identification in small families; and 3) initiate experiments on RNA interference (RNAi) as a potential treatment for select types of hearing loss.

"Autoimmune Disease; Clinical Research; Lupus","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As many as 1.4 million Americans suffer from chronic autoimmunity and inflammation associated with lupus where autoantibody generation leads to accumulation of immune complexes that deposit in skin vasculature kidneys and other organs causing destructive debilitating and sometimes life threatening inflammation. Although lupus is of unknown etiology it is clearly associated with the inefficient disposal of apoptotic cells whih are considered the major source of lupus autoantigens. Complement component C1q triggers engulfment of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) and deficiency in C1q is the strongest known susceptibility factor in lupus. While there has been a lot of attention given to the bridging function of C1q which is a direct and immediate upregulation of phagocytosis this is unlikely to explain its role in prevention of autoimmunity because a) it is not specific for apoptotic cell targets; and b) other C1q-related molecules the collectins also upregulate immediate phagocytosis but loss of these molecules is not associated with autoimmunity. Our preliminary data suggests an alternative hypothesis: C1q elicits a macrophage phenotype specifically tailored for engulfment of apoptotic cells. The data indicate that this pathway requires C1q- triggered macrophage expression of Mer and its ligand Gas6 an interaction that has been shown to regulate efferocytosis and limit inflammatory gene expression. The purpose of this grant is to define the new mechanism. Specific aim one will investigate the requirement of Mer/Gas6 on C1q-dependent efferocytosis in vivo in mice and in vitro using primary human phagocytes. Specific aim two will investigate the signal transduction pathway leading to C1q- dependent upregulation of Mer. Adiponectin is a C1q-homologue that regulates efferocytosis and autoimmunity and preliminary experiments demonstrate a role for adiponectin signaling and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation in C1q-dependent Mer upregulation. Therefore components of these signaling pathways will be analyzed using biochemical techniques. The consequence of Mer deficiency on C1q/adiponectin-dependent regulation of proinflammatory cytokine production will be investigated in specific aim three using Mer wildtype and knockout mouse cells as well as primary human phagocytes. The research will describe a novel pathway relevant to autoimmunity which should provide new molecular targets for therapeutics and diagnostics.      ","5&apos;-AMP-activated protein kinase;Adult;Affect;American;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Antibodies;Antigen-Antibody Complex;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Attention;Autoantibodies;Autoantigens;Autoimmune Diseases;Autoimmune Process;Autoimmunity;Binding;Biochemical;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell surface;Cells;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Classical Complement Pathway;Collectins;Complement;Complement 1q;Data;Defect;Deposition;Development;Diagnostic;Disease;Etiology;Failure;Family;Gene Expression;Generations;Goals;Grant;Growth;Homeostasis;Homologous Gene;Human;Immune response;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Kidney;Knockout Mice;Ku70 protein;Life;Ligands;Lupus;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolism;Molecular;Mus;Normal tissue morphology;Organ;Pathway interactions;Penetrance;Phagocytes;Phagocytosis;Phenotype;Phosphatidylserines;Phosphotransferases;Predisposition;Prevention;Production;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;Refuse Disposal;Regulation;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signal Transduction Pathway;Skin;Source;Systemic Lupus Erythematosus;Techniques;Testing;Up-Regulation;Work;adiponectin;cytokine;in vivo;macrophage;member;molecular targeted therapies;novel;public health relevance;research study;theories","Macrophage polarization by C1q and related molecules","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As many as 1.4 million Americans suffer from lupus a chronic disease that affects skin vasculature kidneys and other organs causing destructive debilitating and sometimes life threatening inflammation.

"Biodefense; Digestive Diseases; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) include the soil-transmitted helminthiases (STHs) which are caused by diverse groups of intestinal nematodes. The parasites include Ascaris Trichuris and hookworms. These infections are common. Ascariasis for example affects 1.4 billion people worldwide and is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8. Control of these nematode parasites relies on an effective supply of anthelmintics. Taking veterinary medicine as an example we know that continued use of anthelmintic compounds for mass chemotherapy will lead to drug resistance. There is a need to identify novel target sites for anthelmintic development. Once such site is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on the nematode pharynx. We have discovered this receptor does not respond to currently used anrthelmintic drugs. Approach: The specific aims of this application are: 1. Optimize expression of C. elegans eat-2 and eat 18 and pharmacologically characterize the resulting receptor. We will investigate optimal conditions for receptor expression and characterize the resulting receptor responses using a range of agonists antagonists and potential allosteric modulators. 2. Clone and express A. suum eat-2 and eat-18. Are other subunits required for the pharyngeal receptor? We will identify orthologs of eat-2 and eat-18 from Ascaris suum clone and express them in Xenopus oocytes for characterization. Additionally we will test the hypothesis that other subunit genes are required to form the receptor. 3. Do eat-2 and eat 18 combine to form the mature receptor? We will test the novel hypothesis that eat-2 and eat-18 combine to form a functional nAChR. On completion of this project we will have expressed in a heterologous system an important new potential drug target from a parasitic nematode. We will have characterized an extremely novel nAChR (one that lacks any alpha subunits). We will have identified the genes that encode these receptors in the parasitic nematode Ascaris suum. Finally we will have determined whether the small (71 a.a.) protein eat-18 is required in the mature ion channel receptor.      ","Adult;Affect;Age;Agonist;Animals;Anthelmintics;Ascariasis;Ascaris;Ascaris suum;Caenorhabditis elegans;Child;Cholinergic Agents;Cholinergic Receptors;Cholinomimetics;Development;Disease;Drosophila acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit;Drug Targeting;Drug resistance;Drug usage;Eating;Genes;Growth;Helminthiasis;Hookworms;Human;Infant;Infection;Integral Membrane Protein;Intestines;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Lead;Levamisole;Life;Methods;Muscle;Nematoda;Nicotine;Nicotinic Receptors;Orthologous Gene;Paralysed;Parasite Control;Parasites;Parasitic infection;Parasitic nematode;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Pharyngeal structure;Population;Protein Subunits;Proteins;Pyrantel;Reporting;Resistance;Resistance development;Site;Soil;System;Testing;Transmembrane Domain;Trichuris;Trichuris trichiura infection;Veterinary Medicine;Work;Xenopus oocyte;avermectin;chemotherapy;cholinergic;gene cloning;interest;man;neglected tropical diseases;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;public health relevance;receptor;receptor expression;response;spastic paralysis","Eating worms: an unusual nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from the nematode pharynx as a potential drug target","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) include soil transmitted nematode parasites like ascariasis trichuriasis and hookworm. Ascariasis for example is one of the most common human parasitic infections. 1.5 billion people worldwide have ascariasis and the disease is most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8. Treatment of helminthiasis includes use of nicotinic anthelmintics like pyrantel and oxantel which selectively paralyze nematodes by activating cholinergic ion-channels (nAChRs) on their muscle. However resistance to anthelmintics drugs is a real concern. We have identified a novel potential target site for new anthelmintics the nAChR on the nematode pharynx which is not sensitive to currently used drugs. We have recapitulated a similar receptor in Xenopus oocytes and plan to confirm this is responsible for the response to nicotine in the nematode pharynx. Of great interest is this receptor contains no alpha subunits- thought to be essential fornAChR formation. The receptor is composed of a only a non- alpha subunit (eat-2) and also of note requires the co-expression of eat-18 (a small 71 aa protein) to form the functional ion channel.         ","NIAID","9018496","1/7/2016","PA-13-303","1R21AI121831-01","1","R21","AI","121831","01","","O'NEIL, MICHAEL T","1/8/2016","12/31/2017","Pathogenic Eukaryotes Study Section[PTHE]"," ","9783143","ROBERTSON, ALAN P","Not Applicable"," ","VETERINARY SCIENCES","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","005309844","DQDBM7FGJPC5","US","42.022225","-93.639475","3974801","IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY","AMES","IA","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","500112025","UNITED STATES","N","1/8/2016","12/31/2016"," ","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","210355"," ","NIAID","150000","60355"," ","210355",
"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Genetics; Infectious Diseases; Sexually Transmitted Diseases/Herpes","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Apicella Gibson Kirby and Wolfe labs have made the unique observations that Neisseria gonorrhoeae proteins undergo extensive N-lysine acetylation and that quorum sensing coordinates this post-translational modification. Our studies have also shown that the degree of N-lysine acetylation effects survival in biofilms. Utilizing novel mass spectrometry techniques Dr. Gibson's lab has shown that mutants of the luxS operon and ackA exhibit a significant increase in acetylated proteins. One such acetylated protein is the response regulator MisR which partners with its cognate sensor kinase MisS to form a two-component signal transduction system (TCS). Our data strongly suggest that MisRS senses the LuxS product. Our preliminary results suggest that the luxS operon functions as a classic quorum sensing system through MisRS and that this TCS controls genes that modulate cell division and N-lysine acetylation. qRT-PCR studies with Ng grown in broth cultures and continuous flow biofilms demonstrate that the product of luxS significantly influences the transcription of a number of genes important in biofilm formation including the gonococcal nuclease that remodels biofilm matrix cell division proteins (minD and ftsZ) peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzymes (murD-murF) regulatory genes (metR) a SIR-2 family protein deacetylase and misRS. The hypothesis guiding this proposal is that quorum sensing and acetylation coordinately regulate biofilm formation to affect pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to determine the transcriptome of key Ng genes in the LuxS-regulated network of genes and the genes associated with reversible acetylation. These studies will be performed on mRNA isolated from organisms in the biofilm and planktonic states 2) To understand the factors controlling Ng biofilm development we will carry out comprehensive and targeted analyses designed to identify changes in the transcriptome proteome and acetylome of Ng strain 1291 grown under defined in biofilms and planktonically and 3) Using N. gonorrhoeae grown over HPV E6/E7 transformed human cervical epithelial cells (HCEC) we will carry out an analogous study of the transcriptome proteome and acetylome to interrogate the possible role of bacterial/eukaryotic signaling on N. gonorrhoeae biofilm development. These studies have the potential to open a new range of novel targets for antibiotics for the treatment of gonorrhea.","Acetylation;Acetyltransferase;Affect;Antibiotic Therapy;Antimicrobial Resistance;Azithromycin;Bioinformatics;Biology;Bulla;Ceftriaxone;Cell division;Cell surface;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cervical;Cervix Uteri;Chromosomes;Collaborations;DNA;Data;Deacetylase;Development;Emergency Situation;Environment;Epithelial Cells;Exhibits;Gene Expression;Gene Proteins;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Gonorrhea;Grant;Growth;Health;Histone Deacetylase;Human;Human Papillomavirus;Immune;In Vitro;Infection;Laboratories;Lysine;Mass Spectrum Analysis;Membrane;Messenger RNA;Microbial Biofilms;Mind;Mutation;Neisseria gonorrhoeae;Nitric Oxide;Operon;Oral;Organism;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Peptides;Peptidoglycan;Phosphotransferases;Play;Post-Translational Protein Processing;Protein Family;Proteins;Proteome;Regulator Genes;Regulon;Reporting;Resistance;Role;Signal Transduction;Surface;System;Techniques;Testing;base;design;effective therapy;enzyme biosynthesis;mutant;novel;novel therapeutics;nuclease;pathogen;quorum sensing;respiratory;response;sensor;transcriptome;vaccine development","Lysine Acetylation in N. gonorrhoeae Quorum Sensing and Biofilm Formation","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Recent reports of gonococci resistant to ceftriaxone and azithromycin have led the WHO to declare a health emergency.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Mental Health; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prior studies examining multiple memory systems in the brain have had great difficulty elucidating the specific neural connections that influence the consolidation and synaptic plasticity for different kinds of learning. The present proposal will utilize optogenetic manipulations of specific pathways connecting different brain regions in rats immediately after the rats have undergone different kinds of learning. Specifically this proposal will build upon the evidence that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) influences consolidation for many different kinds of learning including spatial/contextual emotional and cued-response learning whereas other regions are involved in memory for more discrete forms of learning. Additional evidence indicates that the BLA influences consolidation through regulation of synaptic plasticity in these other brain regions including modulation of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) which has been shown to mediate some of the BLA's effects on memory consolidation. Based on these prior findings the present studies will investigate how distinct BLA projections to different parts of the hippocampus and caudate modulate memory consolidation and Arc expression in downstream brain regions following different kinds of learning. Follow-up experiments will determine whether the increased Arc expression is necessary for the memory modulation. To do so the current proposal will utilize optogenetic control of activity in specific BLA projections immediately after different learning tasks to directly examine in each Aim: 1) how the candidate pathways influence consolidation for the specific type of learning and 2) how the pathways influence Arc expression in downstream regions and whether the Arc expression is necessary for the memory modulation. Aim 1 will determine how BLA projections to different parts of the hippocampal formation influence consolidation and Arc expression for the context vs. footshock learning in a modified contextual fear conditioning task. Aim 2 will determine how BLA projections to part of the hippocampal formation and the caudate influence consolidation and Arc expression for spatial vs. cued-response learning. In both aims optogenetic stimulation/inhibition will be given to each candidate pathway immediately after the relevant training to determine its role in influencing consolidation. Moreover each aim will examine whether such optogenetic manipulations alter Arc expression in different downstream structures and whether reducing Arc levels in those regions prevents the memory-modulating effects of the optogenetic manipulations providing a critical complementary set of experiments that will improve our model for understanding how the BLA influences memory and plasticity-related proteins such as Arc in other regions. The findings from these studies will provide for the first time knowledge for how the specific pathways from the BLA to other brain regions influence memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity. Moreover these experiments will provide a first step to creating an understanding of the functional connections within the brain underlying consolidation processes.","Address;Affect;Amphetamines;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Anterior;Anxiety;Axon;Behavioral;Brain;Brain region;Chemosensitization;Complex;Cues;Disease;Dorsal;Electric Stimulation;Electrophysiology (science);Emotional;Goals;Health;Hippocampal Formation;Hippocampus (Brain);Infusion procedures;Injury;Knowledge;Learning;Maps;Mediating;Memory;Mental Depression;Mental disorders;Modeling;Molecular;Neural Pathways;Neurons;Opsin;Optics;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phobias;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Process;Proteins;Rattus;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Role;Signal Transduction;Structure;Synapses;Synaptic plasticity;System;Time;Training;Water;base;caudate nucleus;cingulate cortex;conditioned fear;design;entorhinal cortex;follow-up;improved;innovation;long term memory;memory consolidation;memory process;optogenetics;prevent;protein expression;relating to nervous system;research study;response","Neural Pathways Modulating Memory Consolidation","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Multiple mental health disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder phobias anxiety and depression involves in alterations in amygdala functioning and basic memory processes.

"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Emphysema; Lung; Prevention; Smoking and Health; Tobacco","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Imaging-based metrics have recently played a central role in the quest to identify COPD phenotypes serving to establish homogeneous sub-populations to aid in genotyping therapeutic targeting and design and outcomes assessment. Recent findings in both animals and humans have lead us to believe that CT derived perfusion (PBF) and mean transit time (MTT) measures within regionally injured lung parenchyma provide for a functional phenotype of which may be directly tied to the etiology of the pathologic process leading to emphysema in acentrilobular emphysema susceptible subset of the smoking population. The primary hypotheses of the proposal are built around the notion that smokers prone to emphysema have abnormal vasoregulation in that regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) continues despite regional lung injury. This failure to block vasoconstriction alters the repair response and leads to tissue destruction in emphysema susceptible smokers (SS) with abnormal vasoregulation. The normal response to regional hypoxia is to shunt blood towards better- ventilated regions. However smoking induces small scale regional infiltrates which in turn lead to local hypoxia HPV would interfere with defense mechanisms serving to clear the irritant and thus interfere with mechanisms of repair. We have demonstrated that in SS subjects with normal PFTs but CT evidence of early centriacinar emphysema (CAE) there is an increased heterogeneity of perfusion. This is supportive of the notion that attenuation of vasoconstriction has failed. Further we have demonstrated a tight correlation between quantitative CT evidence of emphysema with reduced LV filling down to very small amounts of emphysema. We outline a series of experiments seeking to: 1) link increased pulmonary perfusion heterogeneity in SS subjects to the lung's response to alveolar oxygenation; 2) establish that the perfusion heterogeneity is reversible; 3) demonstrate that the response to inflammation and not just inflammation itself is a key factor in the increased heterogeneity and finally; 4) demonstrate that by alleviating heterogeneous vasoconstriction parenchymal hyper-density associated with smoking will clear more quickly in association with smoking cessation. With any combination of positive outcomes of this study we will have provided new insights into disease etiology serving to provide new targets for disease intervention and providing the tools needed for assessing outcomes.      ","Alveolar;Alveolus;Animals;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Apical;Area;Blood;Blood Vessels;Blood Volume;Blood flow;Breathing;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Cialis;Defense Mechanisms;Dilatation - action;Disease;Edema;Etiology;Exercise;Failure;Floods;Functional disorder;Gases;Genotype;Glass;Heterogeneity;Hour;Human;Hyperoxia;Hypoxia;Image;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;Intervention;Irritants;Lead;Link;Lung;Lung Inflammation;Maps;Measures;Mediating;Nitric Oxide;Outcome;Outcome Assessment;Outcome Study;Oxygen;Pathologic Processes;Patients;Perfusion;Phenotype;Play;Population;Predisposition;Process;Pulmonary Emphysema;Pulmonary Inflammation;Pulmonary function tests;Radiolabeled;Resistance;Resolution;Rest;Role;Series;Shunt Device;Signal Transduction;Smoker;Smoking;Stem cells;Structure of parenchyma of lung;Testing;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;Tomography Emission-Computed Single-Photon;Variant;Vascular Diseases;Vascular resistance;Vasodilation;Visual;X-Ray Computed Tomography;airway remodeling;attenuation;base;density;design;expectation;falls;hemodynamics;improved;indexing;injured;insight;lung apex;lung injury;neutrophil;public health relevance;radiotracer;repaired;research study;response;sildenafil;smoking cessation;tadalafil;therapeutic target;tool;vasoconstriction","Functional CT Assessment of Pulmonary Arterial Dysfunction in Smoking Associated Emphysema","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will use dual energy x-ray computed tomography (DECT) to evaluate the relationship between heterogeneous perfusion hypoxia (low oxygen in inspired gas) and induction of pulmonary vascular dilatation to characterize emphysema susceptibility in a normal smoking population.

"Genetics; Human Genome","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cell type specific transcription is achieved through the integration of regulatory inputs from multiple classes of cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers silencers and insulators. Insulators are the class of cis-regulatory elements that establish transcriptional fidelity through the formation of topological domains which prevent enhancers and silencers from interacting with non-target promoters. Defects in insulator function have been identified in cancers imprinting syndromes and repeat expansion diseases highlighting the importance of insulator function in transcriptional regulation. Mounting evidence suggests that insulator-binding proteins are multi-functional regulators serving as transcriptiona activators and repressors and contributing to non- transcriptional functions such as DNA replication. The challenge in the field is to determine how a single insulator protein mediates such diverse regulation and whether a role in chromosome architecture unifies all functions. We address this question through studies of the Drosophila Suppressor of Hairy-wing insulator protein a multi-functional twelve zinc finger DNA binding protein. Three aims are proposed. First we will determine how Su(Hw) establishes insulator function. Second we will define how genomic context of an Su(Hw) binding sites influences Su(Hw) transcriptional functions. Third we will establish the requirements for Su(Hw) in chromosome structure and DNA replication. These investigations will elucidate how a single insulator-binding protein confers multiple regulatory outputs. Information gained from these studies will establish a paradigm for understanding mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation by the human multivalent insulator-binding protein CCCTC binding factor.","Address;Adult;Affect;Architecture;Binding;Binding Proteins;Binding Sites;Biochemical;Biological Assay;CCCTC-binding factor;Chromatin;Chromatin Structure;Chromosome Structures;Chromosomes;Code;DNA;DNA Sequence;DNA biosynthesis;DNA-Binding Proteins;Defect;Development;Disease;Drosophila genus;Elements;Embryo;Enhancers;Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization;Gene Expression;Gene Targeting;Generations;Genetic;Genetic Transcription;Genome;Genomics;Health;Human;Indium;Individual;Investigation;Lead;Link;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Mutation;Nuclear;Nuclear Lamina;Output;Play;Proteins;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Regulatory Element;Repressor Proteins;Role;Syndrome;System;Testing;Tissue-Specific Gene Expression;Tissues;Transcription Coactivator;Transcription Repressor/Corepressor;Transcriptional Regulation;Transgenes;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Wing;Zinc Fingers;cell type;comparative genomic hybridization;fitness;human disease;imprint;improved;mutant;novel;origin recognition complex;prevent;promoter;transcription factor","Regulation of Tissue Specific Gene Expression","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Insulators are cis-regulatory elements critical for transcriptional fidelity.

"Genetics","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation control plays a major role in regulating transcription throughout development and differentiation of multi-cellular organisms. The process is characterized by the default action of negative elongation factors including NELF and DSIF that halt transcription of initiated polymerases near promoters. These promoter proximal paused polymerases are either released from the template by TTF2 or other termination factors or are allowed to enter productive elongation through the selective action of the positive elongation factor P-TEFb. The cyclin dependent kinase activity of P-TEFb is regulated by reversible association with the 7SK snRNP mediated by HEXIM proteins. The main goal of this proposal is to further define the mechanisms utilized to control Pol II elongation. The approach will employ biochemical and molecular methods in human cells. The first aim will explore the role of Gdown1 in the regulation of Pol II elongation. The plan includes in vitro biochemical approaches to purify the Gdown1 negative accessory factor GNAF and to purify and characterize a Gdown1 kinase that controls TTF2 dependent termination. In the second aim studies in vitro and in cells will determine mechanistic details of the control of P-TEFb by the 7SK snRNP. The plan describes methods to study the recruitment of P-TEFb to genes to be activated in which the role of the 7SK snRNP will be determined. The regulated release of P- TEFb from the 7SK snRNP by Brd4 and other factors as well as the critical step of re-sequestration of P- TEFb into the 7SK snRNP will be studied. The goal of the final aim is to identify productive elongation factors and determine how they are involved in the transition into and maintenance of productive elongation. The principle investigator is a professor at the University of Iowa and this project wil be carried out in the excellent environment offered by his lab and the facilities in the Universityof Iowa Carver College of Medicine. The studies proposed here should significantly increase our understanding of mechanisms controlling gene expression and this will be useful in explaining the disregulation of transcription that occurs in cancer and the hijacking of elongationcontrol machinery by the AIDs virus.","Address;Architecture;Biochemical;Cells;ChIP-seq;Complex;Comprehension;Cyclin-Dependent Kinases;Defect;Development;Disease;Elongation Factor;Environment;Event;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;HIV Infections;Health;Human;In Vitro;Infection;Iowa;Maintenance;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Medicine;Messenger RNA;Methods;Molecular;Organism;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Play;Polymerase;Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B;Process;Proteins;RNA Polymerase II;RNA Processing;Regulation;Research Personnel;Role;Small Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins;Techniques;Transcription Elongation;Transcriptional Regulation;Universities;Virus;Work;college;factor EF-P;innovation;insight;negative elongation factor;professor;promoter;reconstitution;termination factor;transcription factor TFIIF","Factors Involved in Transcription by RNA Polymerase II","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    The goal of this project is to understand how gene expression is regulated by controlling RNA polymerase II elongation.

"Acquired Cognitive Impairment; Aphasia; Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program explores the novel hypothesis that many of the processes by which we produce and understand language also place high demands on and receive contributions from the hippocampal declarative memory system. This system is uniquely positioned to access and integrate discourse contextual and experiential information that the language processing system relies on to resolve ambiguity and create meaning. Recent provocative work extends the traditional view of declarative memory as contributing exclusively to long-term memory to include a critical role in the generation and use of on-line representations created during ongoing and online information processing to support behavioral performance in the moment. The proposed studies build upon a set of exciting preliminary findings revealing language deficits at low levels of language processing (i.e. withina single noun phrase) and in the absence of any explicit demands on memory (e.g. no delays; when all the stimuli remain in view) in patients with severe and selective declarative memory impairment. Our studies are built around investigating three key areas of language processing where proposals of the memory determinants are central but untested: Aim 1: To investigate the demands of interactive dialogue on declarative memory; Aim 2: To investigate the demands of referential processing on declarative memory; Aim 3: To investigate the demands of accommodation of talker variability on declarative memory. Our experimental approach capitalizes on a compelling opportunity to combine the study of patients with hippocampal amnesia with eye tracking and behavioral measures to examine the necessity of a form of memory in meeting the demands of language. We will therefore be uniquely able to determine the contributions of hippocampus and declarative memory to language processing and use across multiple levels of language production and comprehension providing crucial tests of hypothesized roles for memory in language use. Language disruptions are common in many neurological and psychiatric conditions where impairments in declarative memory are also prominent including stroke traumatic brain injury Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Thus our efforts to characterize the observed language deficits and link them to underlying memory mechanisms are necessary for understanding the broader neural network and cognitive processes that support language use and for developing more sensitive assessments and effective interventions. This application and the findings generated offers unparalleled insightsand advancements for theories of language processing clinical service delivery to individuals with concomitant disorders of language and memory and understanding the organization and operation of language in the brain.","Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amnesia;Aphasia;Area;Behavioral;Binding;Biological Neural Networks;Brain;Cereals;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Services;Cognitive;Complex;Comprehension;Development;Diagnosis;Early Diagnosis;Early identification;Eye;Generations;Hippocampus (Brain);Impairment;Individual;Language;Language Disorders;Linguistics;Link;Measures;Memory;Memory impairment;Mental disorders;Neurologic;Non-aphasic;Patients;Performance;Play;Positioning Attribute;Prefrontal Cortex;Process;Production;Psycholinguistics;Research;Retrieval;Role;Schizophrenia;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Source;Speech;Speech Perception;Stimulus;System;Testing;Time;Traumatic Brain Injury;Validation;Work;behavior measurement;cognitive neuroscience;cognitive process;effective intervention;executive function;flexibility;improved;information processing;insight;language impairment;language processing;long term memory;meetings;mental representation;nervous system disorder;neuropsychological;novel;operation;phrases;programs;stroke;theories;tool","Language processing and the hippocampal declarative memory system","Disruptions in language use are prevalent debilitating and costly in numerous neurological and psychiatric diseases where declarative memory deficits are also prominent.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell; Stem Cell Research - Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell - Human","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a common disease of the optic nerve that affects over 60 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States. However the biological pathways that lead to glaucoma are not well understood and this has hindered efforts for early detection and treatment of this condition.Consequently there is great need to clarify the causes of glaucoma at the molecular level. We discovered that duplication of the TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) gene is associated with glaucoma that occurs without elevation of eye pressure - termed normal tension glaucoma (NTG). TBK1 function hasn't been studied in the eye although TBK1 has been shown to have a role in autophagy in non-ocular tissue. Autophagy is a cellular process that delivers cytosolic proteins organelles and even intracellular pathogens to lysosomes for clearance. Remarkably three known NTG genes (TBK1 OPTN TLR4) all interact with each other and have important roles in activating autophagy which suggests that autophagy may be an important common pathway in NTG pathogenesis. Moreover autophagy has also been implicated in the retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage in animal models of glaucoma. Based on these data we hypothesize that TBK1 gene duplication alters autophagy and leads to the retinal ganglion cell death and vision loss of NTG. We have created a unique set of resources to study TBK1 autophagy and glaucoma: cultured retinal ganglion cells (using induced stem cell technology) that have an extra dose of the TBK1 gene - the same defect as our patients with TBK1-associated glaucoma. Preliminary studies of these cells have provided more evidence that duplication of TBK1 gene activates autophagy and causes glaucoma. To test our hypothesis and investigate the role of autophagy in glaucoma we propose this two-part aim: DETERMINE THE ROLE OF TBK1 GENE DUPLICATION AND AUTOPHAGY IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF NTG USING IPSC-DERIVED RGC-LIKE NEURONS  Aim 1A: Test cells cultured from patients with NTG due to a TBK1 gene duplication (skin fibroblasts iPSCs  and iPSC-derived RGC-like neurons) for altered autophagy molecules with microscopic biochemical and  autophagic flux assays.  Aim 1B: Determine the effect of TBK1 gene duplication on the phosphorylation of its substrate OPTN at  key residues necessary for its function in autophagy with immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis  with anti-phospho-OPTN antibodies. With these experiments we will begin to characterize the biological pathway by which defects in the TBK1 gene alter autophagy and lead to glaucoma. These studies will also provide the basis for development of novel glaucoma therapies that are targeted to autophagy and glaucoma that occurs without elevation of eye pressure.      ","Affect;African American;Animal Model;Animals;Antibodies;Appearance;Asians;Autophagocytosis;Biochemical;Biological;Biological Assay;Blindness;Caucasians;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Death;Cell physiology;Cells;Characteristics;Data;Defect;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Early treatment;Eye;Fibroblasts;Functional disorder;Gene Duplication;Genes;Glaucoma;Immunoprecipitation;Intervention;Lead;Left;Lysosomes;Methods;Microscopic;Molecular;Nerve;Neurons;Normal Cell;Optic Nerve;Organelles;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Primary Open Angle Glaucoma;Process;Proteins;Reagent;Resources;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Risk Factors;Role;Series;Skin;TANK-binding kinase 1;TLR4 gene;Testing;Tissues;United States;Vision;Visual;Visual Fields;Western Blotting;adult stem cell;base;design;disability;improved;induced pluripotent stem cell;insight;novel;optic nerve disorder;outcome forecast;pathogen;pressure;prevent;public health relevance;research study;stem cell technology;targeted treatment;tool","TBK1-Related Glaucoma","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   We discovered that defects in the gene TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) are a cause of glaucoma a common optic nerve disease that is a leading cause of blindness and visual disability in the United States.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Neurosciences; Regenerative Medicine; Rehabilitation","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor integration with target tissue significantly limits the effectiveness of nearly all neural prostheses. For example cochlear implant (CI) recipients perform poorly with complex auditory tasks due to poor spatial and temporal resolution provided by the neural-electrode interface. Directing growth of spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) neurites into close proximity or even contact with the stimulating electrodes would likely improve spatial and temporal resolution and increase performance. To be useful regrowth must be radial and directed towards the source of stimulation recapitulating normal afferent cochlear innervation. To develop and understand technology designed to guide SGN neurite and Schwann cell (SC) growth photopolymerization (PP) i.e. the formation of polymers using light was used to create microchannels in biocompatible methacrylate polymers. These surface topographic features robustly guide SGN neurite and SGSC growth. We hypothesize that the ability of these physical cues to direct SGN neurite and SGSC alignment depends on specific surface topographic features and material properties and results from tuning of intracellular signals including RhoA and Rho associated kinase (ROCK). In response to BRG PA10-009 the work in this proposal is both design- and hypothesis-driven. In aim 1 the excellent spatial reaction control afforded by PP will be leveraged to fabricate parallel line-space gratings with varied amplitude periodicity and surface nanoroughness. The extent to which these topographic features influence neurite and glial cell adhesion survival and alignment to the pattern will then be determined. As cell-material interactions depend on substrate surface and mechanical properties in addition to surface topography aim 2 determines the survival and morphological responses of neurons and glia to varied surface (e.g. polarity) and mechanical (e.g. stiffness) properties. Finally aim 3 examines the contribution of RhoA/ROCK key mediators of neurite guidance by chemorepulsive cues to neurite and SC alignment to micropatterns. It also seeks to characterize second messenger systems including the cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP that mediate neurite and SC alignment and RhoA/ROCK activity in response to surface topographies. The results of these studies will be among the first to define the basic mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to specific surface topographies and material properties. Furthermore they will identify the topographic features and material properties necessary for future fabrication of scaffolds that can be used for in vivo neural regeneration models including the design of enhanced neuron:prosthesis interfaces.","Acoustic Nerve;Adhesions;Antibodies;Auditory;Axon;Binding;Biochemical;Biocompatible;Biological Assay;Biomedical Engineering;Biosensor;Cell Adhesion;Cells;Clinical;Cochlear Implants;Complex;Cues;Cyclic AMP;Cyclic GMP;Cyclic Nucleotides;Data;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Effectiveness;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Environment;Failure;Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer;Future;Growth;Health;Hearing;Hearing Impaired Persons;Immunoblotting;Implanted Electrodes;In Situ;Length;Light;Mechanics;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Methacrylates;Modeling;Molecular;Morphology;Music;Natural regeneration;Nerve;Nerve Fibers;Nerve Regeneration;Neurites;Neuroglia;Neurons;Neurophysiology - biologic function;Outcome Measure;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Periodicity;Peripheral;Phosphorylation;Polymers;Process;Property;Prosthesis;Protein Isoforms;Radial;Radiation Dosage;Reaction;Rho-associated kinase;Schwann Cells;Second Messenger Systems;Signal Transduction;Source;Staining method;Stains;Surface;System;Technology;Tissues;Ultraviolet Rays;Wettability;Work;base;cell growth;crosslink;density;design;imprint;improved;in vivo;light intensity;mimicry;nanoscale;nerve supply;neural prosthesis;neuroprosthesis;new technology;photopolymerization;primary outcome;relating to nervous system;repaired;response;scaffold;second messenger;secondary outcome;small molecule;spiral ganglion;temporal measurement","Photopolymerization-Induced Topography Directs Neurite and Schwann Cell Alignment","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cochlear implants represent the most successful neuroprosthesis in clinical use. They provide direct electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve t restore hearing to deaf patients. However cochlear implant recipients usually struggle to understand complex auditory signals such as music. These studies seek to develop and understand novel technologies designed to guide regeneration of auditory nerve fibers to directly interface with cochlear implant electrodes. This will greatly improve the ability of cochlear implants to represent complex auditory signals and thereby increase performance. The results will also inform efforts to improve the interface of other neural prostheses and nerve repair conduits with target tissue.","NIDCD","9012816","1/12/2016","PA-11-260","4R01DC012578-04","4","R01","DC","012578","04","","MILLER, ROGER ","3/4/2013","2/28/2018","Auditory System Study Section[AUD]"," ","1953794","HANSEN, MARLAN R","GUYMON, ALLAN ","01","OTOLARYNGOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2016","2/28/2017"," ","173","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","300084"," ","NIDCD","200875","99209"," ","300084",

Dr. Gantz will devote 15% effort and Dr. Hansen will devote 5% effort to Core B.  With the large patient population enrolled and variety of projects and laboratories involved Patient Coordinators are crucial for success of the Clinical Research Center. They efficiently schedule the time patients are at the Center for the multidimensional research programs' data collection. As a liaison between research teams and participants a Patient Coordinator also assists with consenting the research subject. Marta Ross our Adult Patient Coordinator for the past 12 years has been actively involved with developing the proposed program. She manages the scheduling of adult implant subjects; ensures appropriate insurance reimbursement; and provides outreach education about cochlear implants. Ms Ross also is the IRB coordinator updating and renewing local IRB consent forms as well as national IRB issues that are used in the adult clinical trials for the Hybrid SI2 and L24 devices and the severe hearing loss protocol sponsored by Cochlear Corporation. She will also maintain the cochlear implant registry for adults and children. The Adult Patient Coordinator position requires 80% effort. A separate Children's Patient Coordinator Elaine Allen is necessary due to the number of children studied and the new subject accrual. Ms Allen has extensive experience with clinical trials and will devote 80% of her effort to Core B. Coordinator activity is not reimbursed by third party payors and is essential to the entire research program. Preoperative audiologic evaluation of cochlear implant research candidates and postoperative programming and maintenance of devices are time consuming and require on experienced audiologists. The audiologists assist in obtaining research consents and explain the nature of the research to be performed. The project's success as a whole depends on carefully programming and monitoring the participants' devices to ensure accurate results. Audiologists will also administer audiologic tests (See Follow-up Data 4.3) to be used by all projects and monitor hearing aid fitting for all subjects including the bimodal control group. Data collection for the various projects can take up to one full day of an audiologist's time. Ann Perreau and Beth MacPherson will work primarily with adult implant recipients. Beth MacPherson and Ann Perreau have extensive experience programming standard bimodal bilateral and the hybrid implant devices. Ms. MacPherson will contribute 50% effort and Ms Perreau will contribute 80% effort to Core B. We believe that this effort is required for the research protocols and is not reimbursable from insurance or Medicaid. Tanya Van Voorst and Stephanie Gogel will work primarily with pediatric cochlear implant recipients. Ms Van Voorst the principal children's audiologist has 8 years experience with programming and troubleshooting devices in children with cochlear implants. Stephanie Gogel is trained as a pediatric cochlear implant audiologist at our center and has worked closely with Ms Van Voorst. Both will continue to assist in all aspects of the children's preoperative and postoperative implant care device set-up and hearing aid monitoring prior to data collection and speech perception data collection. Ms Van Voorst and Ms Gogel will each devote 80% effort to Core B. Eighty-percent of both Ms Van Voorst and Gogel are essential to collect the audiologic data for all projects. They spend a significant effort on data collection for all projects using children. They will also verify the hearing aid fittings (See 4.3) on bimodal and severely hearing impaired children at each visit to be certain that all equipment is appropriately fit at the time of data collection. They will also check settings on the implant prior to each data collection session. Twenty-percent of their time will be assigned to duties that could possibly generate clinical revenue. Other audiologists are assigned to fitting and following cochlear implant patients who are not participating in our grant. Up to six implants per year will be donated by Cochlear Corporation for either adults or children without funding during the 5 year funding period. Insurance coverage is not available to cover costs associated with these implant subjects. Camille Dunn PhD will provide oversight for the core audiology and speech perception measures that are collected on all subjects and are essential for all projects. She will devote 20% effort to Core B. Ruth Bentler PhD oversee procedures for hearing aid verification and for procedures for quantifying the audibility of our Hybrid and bimodal users. Ruth Bentler PhD will oversee hearing aid verification and guidelines to quantify audibility with Hybrid bimodal and severely hearing impaired populations.  2.2 TECHNICAL SUPPORT Technical support provided for all projects include statistical analysis data management computer programming and maintenance.  2.2.1 Statistical Support Statistical analysis and data management will be provided by Dr. Jacob Oleson a PhD statistician. He will produce statistical tabulations graphs and analyses for all investigators. The projects vary in their complexity and statistical design. Some have large samples of longitudinal data but all have small sample sizes. The potential for missing data also adds to the small sample size problem. Dr. Oleson works with investigators to accommodate these difficulties using appropriate statistical methods. Dr. Oleson will be assisted by a PhD graduate research student in bio-statistics to be named later. Dr. Oleson will devote 20% effort and the graduate research assistant will devote 50% effort to Core B.  2.2.2 Data Management An experienced computer programmer will program maintain and upgrade a relational research database implemented on a central SQL server. Ms. Ji has been responsible for our database for over 6 years and is a critical team-member. Data entry and access are implemented in MS Access. Data is recorded either manually by the subject or an investigator or captured electronically by computer-driven testing software and entered manually into the database and verified by the data entry clerk. She will devote 100% effort to Core B.  2.2.3 Computer Programming and Maintenance The Center has developed several computer-assisted data collection and data analyses programs including: electrophysiological data acquisition and analysis; automated testing and training systems; speech digitizing and editing systems; statistical and database systems; applications development platforms; and a hardware maintenance workshops. Wenjun Wang has been the principal software development engineer responsible for hardware setup and maintenance for the past 7 years. The Center has a central research network integrating all research computers staff and investigator computers. The network is backed-up daily and stored in a College of Medicine Department of Otolaryngology server. The network connects to a campus-wide high-speed fiberoptic network to our research facilities. The University of Iowa has a vBNS connection allowing broadband connection to high performance computing research facilities. He will devote 100% effort to Core B.","Address;Adult;Audiology;Back;Bilateral;Caring;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Research;Clinical Services;Clinical Trials;Cochlear Implants;Computer Assisted;Computer software;Computers;Consent;Consent Forms;Control Groups;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Databases;Development;Devices;Doctor of Philosophy;Education and Outreach;Educational workshop;Electrophysiology (science);Engineering;Enrollment;Ensure;Equipment;Evaluation;Funding;Goals;Grant;Graph;Guidelines;Hearing;Hearing Aids;High Performance Computing;Hybrids;Implant;Individual;Institutional Review Boards;Insurance;Insurance Coverage;Iowa;Laboratories;Maintenance;Measures;Medicaid;Medical;Medicine;Monitor;Names;Nature;Otolaryngology;Outcome Measure;Participant;Patient Care Management;Patients;Performance;Population;Positioning Attribute;Postoperative Period;Procedures;Protocols documentation;Registries;Research;Research Assistant;Research Personnel;Research Project Grants;Research Subjects;Residual state;Sample Size;Sampling;Schedule;Speech;Speech Perception;Speed;Statistical Data Interpretation;Statistical Methods;Students;System;Testing;Third-Party Payer;Time;Training;Universities;Update;Visit;Work;college;computer program;cost;data acquisition;data management;design;experience;follow-up;hearing impairment;implantable device;member;organizational structure;patient population;patient registry;pediatric patients;programs;research facility;software development;statistics;success","Patient Management Audiology Technical Support (Core B)","n/a","NIDCD","9012790","1/22/2016","PAR-10-047","4P50DC000242-30","4","P50","DC","000242","30","",""," ","11/30/2017","ZDC1-SRB-L","6513","1871277","GANTZ, BRUCE JAY","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","Domestic Higher Education","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2016","1/31/2017"," "," ","Research Centers","2016"," ","907915"," ","601269","306646"," "," ",

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention; Rehabilitation","Project 4: An overall goal of this P50 is to evaluate the possible advantages that cochlear implants (Cl) designed to preserve acoustic hearing (Hybrid Cl) may have for potential Cl recipients. The other four projects in this grant use perceptual measures to characterize performance by different groups of study participants (adult vs children hybrid vs bimodal vs standard Cl users). In this section the focus is on developing methods of predicting performance with a Cl that do not rely on behavioral participation by the user. The goal of the first .set of experiments is to develop and validate an evoked potential (EP) test battery that includes both peripheral (compound action potential) and central (cortical change response) measures of neural response and can be used to predict performance with a Cl. Peripheral EP measures (e.g. ECAP growth and/or channel interaction) will be used to characterize limitations in the information transfer imposed by the speech processor and the auditory nerve. Cortical EP measures particularly those evoked in response to a change in some aspect of a complex signal (music speech and/or ripple noise) will provide an index to the way complex signals are processed in the central auditory pathways. Both measures will be compared with performance data and a statistical path analysis model will be used to evaluate the relative contributions of the different levels of physiological processing to overall perception. This approach will be used to evaluate normal hearing and bimodal listeners as well as Hybrid and standard Cl users. These data address questions of how acoustic and electric stimulation is integrated and how EP measures can be used in clinical settings with pediatric populations.  A second set of experiments uses within-subject comparisons to evaluate the effects of training in both adults and children. The studies proposed focus on determining whether changes in a cortical EP assessed using speech and/or musical stimuli before and immediately following participation in a short-term training program can accurately predict benefit from participation in a longer term training program.","Acoustic Nerve;Acoustic Stimulation;Acoustics;Action Potentials;Address;Adoption;Adult;Affect;Age;Auditory;Auditory Evoked Potentials;Auditory system;Behavioral;Brain;Child;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cochlear Implants;Complex;Data;Data Set;Development;Ear structure;Effectiveness;Electric Stimulation;Electrophysiology (science);Evoked Potentials;Exhibits;Frequencies;Goals;Grant;Growth;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Hybrids;Individual;Iowa;Lead;Maps;Measures;Methods;Modeling;Morphology;Music;Neuraxis;Noise;Outcome Measure;Participant;Perception;Performance;Peripheral;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Pliability;Population;Procedures;Process;Residual state;Series;Signal Transduction;Speech;Speech Perception;Stimulus;Structure;Study Subject;TNFRSF5 gene;Technology;Testing;Time;Training;Training Programs;auditory pathway;base;clinical decision-making;clinical practice;comparison group;design;implantation;improved;indexing;patient population;pediatric patients;programs;relating to nervous system;research study;response;signal processing;success","Electrophysiology","Cochlear implant users with residual hearing can make use of both electrical and acoustic information to understand speech and to appreciate music.

These studies have demonstrated large individual differences in speech and language outcomes following cochlear implantation. The reasons for this variability are not well understood in part because we know little about how cochlear implant recipients use information in the speech signal to arrive at the intended message. The primary goal of the proposed work is to examine the central perceptual and cognitive processes used during spoken language comprehension that may contribute to variation in performance. Using empirical techniques from basic science the proposed work will examine mechanisms of lexical processing and perceptual learning in a variety of cochlear implant users including a group of cochlear implant participants implanted with novel hearing-preservation electrodes. The proposed research further will examine whether differences in these perceptual processing mechanisms are associated with individual variations in cochlear implant outcomes. Across the sample this work will examine how the nature of the auditory input (electric vs. acoustic plus electric) influences lexical access perceptual normalization and perceptual learning in adults and children with cochlear implants. In cooperation with Projects 1 (A+E) 2 (Speech/Language Outcomes) 4 (Electrophysiology) and 5 (Music) the relationship between performance on these process-based measures and performance on other auditory and cognitive tasks will be analyzed.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention; Rehabilitation","Research on the communication and academic achievement of children receiving cochlear implants (Cl) shows that these children become functional members of the hearing community alongside other children with less severe hearing loss who wear hearing aids (HAs). The extent to which children with CIs have similar functional capabilities will be addressed in this research program. We will obtain data on non-speech auditory perception speech perception music perception speech language reading skills and service provision for a group of 7 and 8 year old children fitted with unilateral bimodal or bilateral CIs. These data will be compared qualitatively and quantitatively with mild to severe hard of hearing (HH) age mates. This aim will lead to evidence-based clinical guidelines in determining candidacy criteria for cochlear implants or hearing aids. Recently CIs that preserve residual acoustic hearing (hybrid devices) have been shown to provide hearing benefits to adults with some residual hearing but these devices have not yet been used with children. In this study children who are 5 to 15 years of age with moderate to severe hearing loss will receive a hybrid cochlear implant. Speech perception speech production language music perception outcomes will be compared to bimodal and HH children. This aim explores an alternative for children who have some residual hearing but are not benefitting from conventional hearing aids to simultaneously take advantage of electric stimulation and their natural acoustic hearing.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rehabilitation","Project 1: Acoustic Plus Electric Hearing Preservation of residual acoustic hearing during cochlear implantation has become an important improvement in the performance of cochlear implants. Not only does it improve the performance of implants (particularly for noisy real-world listening conditions) but also allows the treatment of patients with severe high-frequency hearing loss who have substantial low-frequency hearing. This project proposes to continue this work on combining acoustic plus electric (A+E) hearing. In addition to the overall goal of improving patient care for hearing loss several unique research opportunities arise from this work. The first opportunity arises because of the new population of patients that will be implanted with these A+E devices. Never before have patients with such high levels of pre-operative residual hearing been implanted in such a large- scale project. We are at the same time seeing levels of performance for the transmission of speech through the short electrode that are surprising in light of the previous literature.

"No NIH Category available","This application requests continuation of the Iowa Cochlear Implant Clinical Research Center. Hearing preservation and combining acoustic plus electric speech processing have become very important concepts and our Center has played an important role in identifying the significance of residual acoustic hearing. We believe that hearing-preservation electrodes will improve outcomes because they allow users to combine electric auditory stimulation with any residual natural acoustic hearing. Our overarching goal is to examine how this hybrid approach to speech processing might benefit new populations of adults and children. We will also investigate the use of these less invasive electrodes in profoundly deaf infants where they might help preserve the structural elements of the organ of Corti and enable this population to take advantage of ongoing future research to regenerate the peripheral auditory system. Our first objective aims to compare how electrode length affects the patient's ability to adapt to hearing the severely distorted frequency-place maps produced when acoustic plus electric stimulation are combined. This assessment will examine outcomes for hearing speech and language and music perception and enjoyment and will also characterize Cl users in terms of underlying processing mechanisms. Thus we propose to study the plasticity learning and adaptation mechanisms that might be central to predicting good outcomes. Our second objective is to define the boundaries between the appropriateness of hearing aids versus cochlear implants in populations of hard of hearing children. Third we will examine whether profoundly deaf infants develop speech perception and language equally well with standard-length cochlear implants versus less invasive electrodes. We will study hearing-preservation electrode CIs in 105 adults and 80 children with residual acoustic hearing and 20 profoundly deaf infants. Control subjects will be obtained from a research registry that now has enrolled 335 previously implanted adults and children. Five research projects an administrative Core A and Patient Care Speech Processing and Technical Core B will address the above goals. The five research projects are highly integrated and depend on data from each other to answer the experimental questions.","Acoustic Stimulation;Acoustics;Address;Adult;Affect;Auditory;Auditory system;Belief;Bilateral;Binaural;Biological Preservation;Cereals;Characteristics;Child;Child Language;Childhood;Clinical;Clinical Research;Cochlear Implants;Cochlear implant procedure;Cochlear structure;Contralateral;Cues;Data;Development;Devices;Doctor of Philosophy;Ear structure;Electric Stimulation;Electrodes;Electrophysiology (science);Elements;Enrollment;Environment;Esthesia;Evoked Potentials;Frequencies;Funding;Future;Goals;Hearing;Hearing Aids;Hearing Impaired Persons;High-Frequency Hearing Loss;Hybrids;Implant;Individual Differences;Infant;Iowa;Language;Learning;Length;Life Experience;Light;Literature;Location;Maps;Measures;Methods;Music;Natural regeneration;Neuronal Plasticity;Noise;Organ of Corti structure;Outcome;Patient Care;Patients;Perception;Performance;Peripheral;Physiological;Play;Population;Principal Investigator;Procedures;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Registries;Rehabilitation therapy;Request for Applications;Research;Research Project Grants;Residual state;Role;Signal Transduction;Speech;Speech Perception;Testing;Time;Toddler;Training;Variant;Voice;Work;base;clinical practice;design;functional outcomes;hearing impairment;improved;improved outcome;infant outcome;language processing;lexical;patient population;phonology;regenerative;research study;response;speech processing;speech recognition;transmission process","Iowa Cochlear Implant Clinical Research Center Project VI","This research has the potential to alter clinical practice.

Subproject 1 Acoustic Plus Electric Hearing Principal Investigator: Christopher W. Turner Ph.D.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of residual acoustic hearing during cochlear implantation has become an important improvement in the performance of cochlear implants. Not only does it improve the performance of implants (particularly for noisy real-world listening conditions) but also allows the treatment of patients with severe high-frequency hearing loss who have substantial low-frequency hearing. This project proposes to continue this work on combining acoustic plus electric (A+E) hearing. In addition to the overall goal of improving patient care for hearing loss several unique research opportunities arise from this work. The first opportunity arises because of the new population of patients that will be implanted with these A+E devices. Never before have patients with such high levels of pre-operative residual hearing been implanted in such a large-scale project. We are at the same time seeing levels of performance for the transmission of speech through the short electrode that are surprising in light of the previous literature. This will allow us to re-examine some of the commonly held beliefs about the limitations of electric stimulation due to channel interaction. The second opportunity arises because the short-electrode Hybrid implant assigns low- and mid-frequency speech bands to extreme basal locations in the cochlea. Thus we have a unique opportunity to study the effects of remapping neural plasticity and adaptation to highly-distorted place-frequency maps in the cochlea.","NIDCD","9012783","1/22/2016","PAR-10-047","4P50DC000242-30","4","P50","DC","000242","30","","KING, KELLY ANNE","9/9/1985","11/30/2017","ZDC1-SRB-L(42)"," ","1871277","GANTZ, BRUCE JAY","Not Applicable","01","OTOLARYNGOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2016","11/30/2017"," ","173","Research Centers","2016","2238092"," ","NIDCD","1878331","948598"," ","2238092",
"Biodefense; Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Prevention; Rare Diseases","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ebolavirus attacks are devastating and unpredictable. To control an ebolavirus outbreak it is essential to identify isolate and treat infected individuas rapidly. However the available diagnostics ELISA and RT- PCR require laboratory sophistication that is not possible at point-of-care in many African and other isolated locations. Thus a portable device that needs no laboratory support is essential to detect early markers of ebolavirus infection. We propose to develop a point-of-care detection device targeting the conserved and highly abundant soluble ebolavirus glycoprotein (sGP) a marker of viral infection that appears in the blood stream early during infection. The detection will be enabled by aptamers attached to microcantilevers. Aptamers are nucleic acids with many of the properties of antibodies but with the advantage that they are selected and synthesized in vitro and can be reliably reproduced. They can be adapted to many assay formats including electrochemical optical (colorimetric chemiluminescent & fluorescent) and mechanical. Aptamers are very stable when dehydrated and ideal for sensors that must be stored for long time periods before their use for occasional viral outbreaks. As recognition elements for biosensors aptamers have many advantages over antibodies including small size capability for repetitive use long shelf-life at room temperature while dehydrated amenability to chemical synthesis and chemical modifications and adaptability to broad assay formats. Thus aptamer-based biosensors (aptasensors) are more suitable than antibodies for point-of-care biosensor development. The goal of this proposal is to develop an aptasensor for early diagnosis of ebolavirus infection at point- of-care (either at bedside or at mobile clinic) that will lead to effective treatment and containment of the virus outbreak. We have three specific aims: 1) Use a combination of SELEX next generation sequencing and bioinformatics to identify DNA aptamers that recognize sGPs from all African ebolavirus species with nanomolar affinity. 2) Build a prototype array of aptamer-functionalized microcantilever device for sGP detection to provide proof of concept for future field application. 3) Assess the efficacy and sensitivity of the detection device for recombinant sGP and sGP in serum from infected macaques. The innovation of this proposal lies in the integration of aptamer and microcantilever detection technologies which will allow thedevelopment of a point-of-care biosensor for early detection of ebolavirus infection based on the appearance of viral sGP in the blood stream. The longer term goal is to expand the capability of the microcantilever aptasensor which can be multiplexed to include the detection of other hemorrhagic viruses that present similar symptoms to ebolavirus in the early stages.      ","Acute;Affinity;Africa;African;Antibodies;Appearance;Aptamer Technology;Binding;Bioinformatics;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biosensor;Blood;Categories;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Central Africa;Chemicals;Clinic;Containment;DNA;Dehydration;Detection;Development;Devices;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Early Diagnosis;Ebola virus;Elements;Environment;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Equipment;Evolution;Filovirus;Frequencies;Future;Glycoproteins;Goals;Gold;Heating;Human;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Interferometry;Label;Laboratories;Lead;Length;Life;Ligands;Location;Macaca;Measures;Mechanics;Modification;Monitor;Nucleic Acid Binding;Nucleic Acids;Optics;Phase;Population;Procedures;Property;Reagent;Recombinants;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Serum;Silicon;Staging;Stream;Stress;Surface;Symptoms;System;Technology;Temperature;Terrorism;Thick;Time;Translating;Viral;Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers;Virus;Virus Diseases;Vision;aptamer;base;cantilever;chemical synthesis;detector;disorder prevention;effective therapy;innovation;laboratory equipment;mortality;nanomolar;next generation sequencing;phase 1 study;point of care;point-of-care diagnostics;prototype;public health relevance;sensor;tool","Detecting Ebola Virus Infections","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ebolavirus outbreaks are devastating unpredictable increasing in frequency result in many lives lost and have the potential for use in terrorism or bio-warfare.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Junctophilin 2 (JP2) is a structural protein required for the formation of junctional couplings (i.e. cardiac dyads) between transverse (T)-tubule membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and is fundamental for local control of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and efficient contraction in ventricular myocytes during cardiac excitation- contraction (E-C) coupling. In animal models of heart failure JP2 protein levels progressively decline leading to T-tubule remodeling and loss of E-C coupling function. JP2 levels are also markedly reduced in human failing hearts. Our recently published and preliminary data demonstrate that JP2 is posttranslational regulated by calpain a Ca2+-activated protease implicated in a variety of heart diseases. JP2 cleavage by calpain was originally hypothesized to underlie JP2 downregulation in failing hearts. In pilot studies we made the novel and unexpected observation that an N-terminal JP2 cleavage fragment termed ""JP2NT"" unlike full length JP2 is imported into nucleus where it has a profound function in transcriptional reprogramming in cardiomyocytes. However the (patho) physiological consequences of JP2NT nuclear localization and related molecular mechanisms are completely unknown. Based on these novel exciting preliminary findings we hypothesize that in response to stress calpain-mediated cleavage of JP2 transforms JP2 from a structural protein into a transcriptional regulator that reprograms the transcriptional profile of damaged cardiomyocytes and represses the development of cardiac hypertrophy. This molecular event may be an important trigger for transcriptional remodeling serving as an unappreciated protective mechanism under pathological conditions. We will test our hypothesis using a multidisciplinary approach including multiple novels transgenic and CRISPR-based mouse models molecular biology biochemistry and a novel in situ confocal imaging technique developed by our lab. In Aim 1 we will explore the molecular mechanisms underlying JP2NT transcriptional regulation in cardiomyocytes whereas Aim 2 will examine the patho(physiological) consequences of JP2NT in the heart. We anticipate the proposed studies will provide significant insights into the novel functions of JP2NTin membrane-to-nucleus signal transduction in the setting of cardiac stress and new insights into the cross- communication between cardiomyocyte structural remodeling and transcriptional remodeling in heart disease. This information will serve as a platform for the future development of novel heart failure therapeutics.       ","Animal Model;Binding;Biochemistry;CRISPR/Cas technology;Calpain;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiomyopathies;Cell Nucleus;Cell Proliferation;Cleaved cell;Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats;Communication;Complex;Coupling;Data;Development;Down-Regulation;Echocardiography;Electrophysiology (science);Event;Future;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart Hypertrophy;Heart failure;Hospitalization;Human;Image;Imaging Techniques;In Situ;Knock-in Mouse;Length;Light;Mediating;Membrane;Messenger RNA;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Molecular Chaperones;Muscle Cells;N-terminal;Nuclear;Nuclear Localization Signal;Pathogenesis;Patients;Phenotype;Physiological;Pilot Projects;Process;Property;Proteins;Publishing;Regulation;Reporter;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Signal Transduction;Stress;Structural Genes;System;Technology;Testing;Therapeutic;Transcriptional Regulation;Transducers;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Transmembrane Domain;Ventricular;Work;base;chromatin modification;chromatin remodeling;insight;interdisciplinary approach;junctophilin;mouse model;mutant;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;promoter;public health relevance;response;scaffold;transcriptome","Novel functions of E-C coupling structural protein junctophilin-2 in the heart","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 and causes an enormous burden on our health care system.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Services; Nutrition; Obesity; Physical Activity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this project is to determine whether and why the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) menu labeling requirement impacts obesity by examining changes in consumer behavior and restaurant menus. Due to the relationship between eating outside of the home and obesity and the difficulty of consumers in accurately determining the nutritional content of menu items the ACA requires chain restaurants to post calorie information on menus. This requirement will be implemented on December 1 2015 and builds upon similar state and local laws first implemented in 2008. Preliminary evidence suggests that changes in body mass index (BMI) over time in counties that previously introduced a menu labeling requirement fell in recent years relative to nearby counties. In contrast prior research on local menu labeling laws primarily examines changes in items ordered at large chain restaurants and generally finds small or no changes in the amount of calories purchased after calorie counts are posted on menus. Such a narrow focus misses numerous other potential changes in restaurant menus and consumer behavior due to these requirements. This project significantly expands on the prior literature by examining the nationwide implementation of the ACA's menu labeling requirement and examining the broader impacts of this requirement on behavior. Specifically this project will evaluate the impact of theACA's menu labeling requirement on (1) restaurant menu offerings and prices (2) consumer eating habits (3) physical activity and (4) body mass index and obesity. Difference-in-differences comparisons over time before and after the implementation of the menu labeling requirement among groups affected by the requirement and groups not affected will provide estimates of the impact of menu labeling. Affected restaurants are chains with 20 or more locations that did not voluntarily previously post calories on menus and are located in areas without a prior local mandate. Affected consumers are individuals living in counties or states without a pre-ACA calorie posting mandate. To construct these estimates this project will involve collecting and analyzing menus and nutritional content from chain restaurants surveying consumers in areas with prior calories posting mandates and surrounding regions and analyzing the resulting data and analyzing data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The expected outcomes of this project are an understanding of the impact of greater access to information in the form of calorie posting requirements on obesity and the mechanisms through which calorie posting influences obesity. Thus this project will inform policymakers and researchers about whether and how the calorie posting mandate in the Affordable Care Act impacts obesity rates.      ","Access to Information;Adult;Affect;Affordable Care Act;Area;Awareness;Behavior;Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System;Body mass index;Calories;County;Data;Data Analyses;Data Collection;Diet;Diet Habits;Eating;Exercise;Frequencies;Goals;Habits;Health;Home environment;Individual;Label;Laws;Life;Literature;Location;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Nutritional;Obesity;Outcome;Physical activity;Price;Public Health;Research;Research Personnel;Restaurants;Surveys;Systems Analysis;Testing;Time;consumer behavior;cost;fast food;improved;public health relevance;response","Understanding the Effect of Calorie Menu Labels on Obesity: Producer and Consumer Responses to the ACAs Calorie Posting Requirement","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a component of the Affordable Care Act chain restaurants with 20 or more locations will be required to post calorie content on menus/menu boards beginning in December 2015.

"Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mitochondria play a central role in cell bioenergetics and control multiple aspects of neuronal life and death including regulation of Ca2+ signaling. By buffering Ca2+ during excitation and subsequently releasing Ca2+ back to the cytosol mitochondria shape [Ca2+]i signals and regulate numerous Ca2+-dependent functions in neurons such as excitability synaptic plasticity and gene expression. However excessive load of mitochondria with Ca2+ trigger neurotoxic processes in stroke and in Alzheimer's Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. In spite of the importance of neuronal mitochondrial Ca2+ transport the molecules mediating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release in neurons are not known. This knowledge gap presents a major obstacle in our progress toward understanding and therapeutically exploiting mitochondrial functions. Thus the first objective of this proposal is to identify the molecular components of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in neurons. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that rapidly undergo fission and fusion (MFF) which affects transport of mitochondria synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. Notably mitochondrial fission is an early event in stroke and fragmented mitochondria are prevalent in Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Given the central role of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in neuronal life and death it is possible that the effects of MFF on neuronal survival are mediated in part through changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ handling although this idea has not been tested. Thus our second objective is to determine how MFF status affects mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons. Based on our preliminary data and published literature we hypothesize that CCDC109A CCDC109B and MICU1-3 are essential molecular components of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in neurons and that the MFF process provides important control of CCDC109A and/or CCDC109B activities mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and Ca2+ homeostasis in neurons exposed to neurotoxic conditions. We will use innovative approaches including genetically encoded mitochondrial Ca2+ sensors electron probe X-ray microanalysis and novel genetic mouse strains to test our hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will identify the roles of novel proteins CCDC109A CCDC109B and MICU1 2 and 3 in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in neurons. Aim 2 will determine how mitochondrial restructuring regulates mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in neurons and examine specific roles of CCDC109A and CCDC109B phosphorylation in this process. Aim 3 will examine the function of MFF in maintaining neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis under neurotoxic conditions such as excessive exposure to glutamate and ischemia. This project will provide insight into the molecular organization of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in neurons and will establish mechanistic links between mitochondrial dynamics Ca2+ signaling and neuronal Ca2+ homeostasis. We anticipate that these studies will be transformative because they will identify new molecular and genetic tools for exploring many functions of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in neurons and may lead to new therapeutics targeting mitochondrial Ca2+ transport and MFF for treating stroke and neurodegeneration.","Address;Affect;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Back;Bioenergetics;Brain;Buffers;Cause of Death;Cells;Cessation of life;Chimeric Proteins;Co-Immunoprecipitations;Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases;Cytosol;Data;Development;Electron Probe Microanalysis;Enzymes;Event;Exposure to;Gene Expression;Genetic;Glucose;Glutamates;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Homeostasis;Homologous Gene;Human Genome;Huntington Disease;Image;Impairment;Ischemia;Knowledge;Lead;Life;Link;Literature;Measurement;Mediating;Mitochondria;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Monitor;Mouse Strains;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Organelles;Outer Mitochondrial Membrane;Oxygen;Parkinson Disease;Phosphorylation;Phosphorylation Inhibition;Pilot Projects;Play;Process;Protein Isoforms;Protein phosphatase;Proteins;Publishing;RNA Interference;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Reporting;Role;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Slice;Synaptic plasticity;Testing;United States;base;deprivation;disability;innovation;insight;knock-down;mouse genome;neuron loss;neuronal survival;neuroprotection;neurotoxic;neurotoxicity;neurotransmission;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;patch clamp;prevent;sensor;stroke;stroke treatment;tool;uptake","Mitochondria fission and fusion (MFF)-dependent mechanisms in neuronal toxicity","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stroke and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are among the leading causes of death and disabilities in the United States and worldwide.

"Breast Cancer; Cancer; Obesity","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type (~1383500 new cases/year) the leading cause of cancer-associated death among woman worldwide (~458400 death/year) and the 2nd most lethal cancer in the United States. Obesity happens in 36% adults in the United States contributing to breast-cancer incidence and progression. Whereas several inflammatory cytokines are implicated in breast cancer their distinct roles in obesity-driven cancer progression are largely elusive. Our preliminary data identified interleukin-1 (IL-1)/IL-1R1 signaling cascade to be required for obesity-driven breast cancer progression (ODBP) from different tumor models. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that underlie ODBP and to prevent or treat obese breast-cancer patients. The objective of the proposed research is to determine the mechanism how NLRC4-inflammasome and IL-l/IL-1R1 axis drive breast-cancer progression under obese condition. Our central hypothesis is that some danger signal from obese tumors induces NLRC4-inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1 production in tumor-associated stroma which in turn promotes tumor progression through the induction of angiogenesis. We thus propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine the relevance of NLRC4-inflammasome in ODBP. Specific Aim 2: Determine how NLRC4 promotes ODBP within the tumor microenvironment; Specific Aim 3: Explore novel combinatory regimens to treat obese breast-cancer patients. Our results are expected to have a positive impact on guiding targeted therapy for inhibiting the breast-cancer progression in obese patients. The potential application of available agents such as anakinra (known to be safe and effective for the treatment of other diseases) or some long-lasting Casp-1 inhibitors for breast-cancer therapy would significantly shorten the drug development process. The study may potentially benefit the over one third of breast-cancer patients considering that ~36% adults are obese in the United States.        ","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Adult;Antidiabetic Drugs;Biochemistry;Body mass index;Breast Cancer Model;Breast Cancer Patient;Breast Cancer Risk Factor;Breast Cancer therapy;CASP1 gene;Cancer Biology;Cancer Etiology;Cessation of life;Chronic;Data;Development;Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging;Disease;Genetic;Goals;Human;Immunology;Incidence;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-1 beta;Interleukin-18;Interleukins;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammary Neoplasms;Metformin;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Myeloid Cells;Neoplasm Metastasis;Obese Mice;Obesity;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Peptide Hydrolases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Process;Production;Regimen;Research;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specimen;Transplantation;United States;Weight;Woman;Work;anakinra;angiogenesis;cancer type;cell type;cytokine;design;drug development;effective therapy;efficacy testing;interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor;malignant breast neoplasm;men;novel;outcome forecast;pathogen;prevent;protein complex;public health relevance;receptor;research study;secretion process;targeted treatment;therapeutic target;tumor;tumor growth;tumor microenvironment;tumor progression","Obesity inflammation and breast cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research aims to establish NLRC4 inflammasome activation as the major mechanism that underlies obesity-driven breast cancer progression.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Actin is highly conserved across all eukaryotes and misregulation by alterations in actin binding protein activity results in severe developmental defects and contributes to diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The activities of the >100 known actin binding proteins are well studied; but the signaling pathways and mechanisms that coordinate the functions of multiple actin binding proteins to drive actin remodeling necessary for morphogenesis remain poorly understood. To uncover mechanisms coordinating the activities of actin binding proteins we take advantage of the powerful genetics and well-characterized actin-dependent process of follicle or egg development in Drosophila. We have made the novel finding that a class of lipid signals termed prostaglandins (PGs) regulates multiple actin remodeling events necessary for Drosophila follicle development. Our long term goal is to determine the means by which specific PG signaling cascades coordinately regulate particular actin binding proteins to control cytoskeletal dynamics. The critical next step towards achieving this goal are to identify the actin binding proteins acting downstream of PG signaling elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this PG regulation and determine how the activities of these actin regulators are integrated. The central hypothesis of the proposed work isthat distinct PG signaling cascades regulate specific actin binding proteins to restrict actin filament formation promote bundle formation and mediate cortical actin contraction necessary for morphogenesis. Aim 1 will define the specific PG signaling cascade that inhibits inappropriate actin filament formation and the molecular mechanisms by which it regulate the actin elongation factor Enabled. Additional actin binding proteins regulated by this PG signaling pathway to coordinate actin filament formation with developmental stage will be identified. Aim 2 will delineate a different PG signaling pathway that promotes parallel bundle formation and the means by which this pathway coordinates the opposing action of two actin binding proteins Enabled and Capping Protein (a barbed end capper). Aim 3 will uncover the PG pathway that regulates cortical actin contraction by regulating Non-Muscle Myosin Regulatory Light Chain. The expected contributions of this study are the identification of specific PG signaling pathways that inhibit or promote actin filament formation and drive acto-myosin contraction elucidation of the molecular means by which these pathways regulate four conserved actin binding proteins and identification of the complement of actin binding proteins that are coordinately regulated by these PG pathways. The contributions of this study will be significant because: 1) it will establis a framework to define the roles of other lipid signals during development; 2) it will provide new insight into the roles of individual PGs in tissue morphogenesis; and 3) it will bring together separate fields - lipid actin cytoskeletal and developmental biology. Furthermore these findings should be broadly applicable to other PG-dependent processes including cell migration vertebrate gastrulation cardiovascular function and disease and cancer.      ","Acids;Actin-Binding Protein;Actins;Animals;Automobile Driving;Biological Models;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular Physiology;Cell Communication;Cells;Communication;Complement;Complex;Congenital Abnormality;Contracts;Cytoskeleton;Defect;Development;Developmental Biology;Dinoprostone;Disease;Drosophila genus;Elongation Factor;Enzymes;Equilibrium;Eukaryota;Event;Failure;Filament;Genetic;Goals;Homeostasis;Individual;Light;Lipids;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Microfilaments;Molecular;Morphogenesis;Myosin ATPase;Myosin Regulatory Light Chains;Myosin Type II;Nurses;Pathway interactions;Play;Pliability;Process;Prostaglandins;Proteins;Regulation;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Staging;Structure;Tissues;Work;cell motility;egg;fascin;gastrulation;genetic approach;human disease;insight;member;non-muscle myosin;novel;prevent;public health relevance;spatiotemporal","Prostaglandins control development by coordinating actin cytoskeletal remodeling","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coordinate regulation of actin cytoskeletal remodeling is required for normal development and its mis- regulation contributes to diseases including cardiovascular diseases and cancer development and progression.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Cardiovascular; Clinical Research; Congenital Heart Disease; Genetic Testing; Genetics; Heart Disease; Pediatric; Prevention; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) are genetic cardiovascular diseases that cause sudden cardiac death. When a person is diagnosed with HCM or LQTS their entire genetic family is at high risk for the same disease and should be notified of their risk and screened for disease through a process called cascade screening. The responsibility for notifying family members of this risk falls to the first person in the family diagnosed (proband). However nearly half of relatives are not screened in accordance with cascade screening recommendations because they are not aware of their risk. This study will investigate the relationship between family network factors (geographical distance frequency of visual and non-visual contact emotional closeness relationship affect and age) and non-network factors (disease factors including severity certainty of testing and treatments; individual factors including risk perception feelings of responsibility anxiety and gender; and sociocultural influences) and communication of genetic risk between probands and their relatives in families at risk for HCM/LQTS.  Objectives: The purpose of this social network study is to improve our understanding of the relationship between network and non-network factors and communication of genetic risk between probands and their relatives in families at risk for HCM/LQTS. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1) Describe family social network structures and communication paths about risk for HCM/LQTS from probands to their relatives; Aim 2) Identify which network and non-network factors predict who is told about risk for HCM/LQTS.  Methods: An egocentric social network study will be used to investigate two specific aims. The sample will be comprised of probands with HCM or LQTS and recruited through the University of Iowa Cardiology Clinics. Data will be collected using a family pedigree and a structured interview. Egocentric social network analysis including descriptive and multilevel logit modeling will be used.  Relevance: This research aims to improve our understanding of the relationship between network and non-network factors and communication of genetic risk between probands and their relatives in families at risk for HCM/LQTS. This research will support my long-term goal build a program of behavioral research that will focus on clinical use of genomic information to prevent death and complications of cardiovascular disease through development of interventions and policy aimed at improved improving cascade screening among individuals and families at risk for inherited cardiovascular disease.

Although collectively quite common individually each disease- causing gene is quite rare. Three genes USH2A ABCA4 and RHO account for a large portion of disease and elicit a wide-range of RP clinical phenotypes caused by an array of different disease-causing mutations. In this proposal we will use CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to target and correct three different classes of disease-causing mutations: 1) an intronic cryptic splice site mutation in USH2A; 2) an exonic coding sequence mutation in ABCA4; and 3) a dominant gain-of-function mutation in RHO. Using a CRISPR-based strategy will allow for disease-causing genes to remain under control of their endogenous promoters allow for correction of large genes not amenable to gene replacement therapy and provide an avenue to `turn off' harmful dominant gain of function mutations. These genome-editing approaches will be tested on patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells with molecularly confirmed mutations. Correcting cells that harbor a disease-causing mutation will allow for generation of cells for future autologous transplantation studies in human patients.

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease; Heart Disease - Coronary Heart Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure (HF) the fastest-growing type of cardiac disease in the U.S. is a pathophysiologic state in which the heart fails to pump sufficient blood to meet the needs of the body. In failing ventricular myocytes from animal models and human patients we and others have demonstrated disruption of the widely distributed and highly organized cardiomyocyte traverse (T)-tubule system. These orderly invaginations of surface membrane into the cell interior are critical for rapid electric excitation initiation and synchronus triggering of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release and therefore coordinated contraction of each contractile unit throughout the entire myocyte. T-tubule loss and disorganization instigate development of HF due to aberrant intracellular Ca2+ release and blunted contractile function. However there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms and pathways that regulate T-tubular integrity or that participate in destructive T-tubule remodeling. Our preliminary data indicate that junctophilin-2 (JP2) a structural protein spanning T-tubules and the SR membrane is crucial for normal T-tubule organization. Our data in animal models of cardiac stress show that downregulation of the JP2 is associated with T-tubule disorganization and HF development.  Furthermore our preliminary results indicate that JP2 downregulation is driven by activation of the Ca2+- dependent protease calpain though the upstream events that result in calpain-mediated degradation of JP2 in HF remain unclear. The goal of this project is to define the mechanisms of JP2 dysregulation and T-tubule remodeling in cardiac disease. We will combine multidisciplinary approaches including in situ confocal imaging electrophysiology molecular biology pathological mouse models and novel transgenic mouse models to test two specific aims. Aim 1. To define the molecular mechanisms underlying JP2 downregulation in heart failure.  Aim 2. To determine if and how recombinant JP2 expression can attenuate stress-induced T-tubule remodeling and protect against HF progression. As HF is the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 and causes an enormous burden on our health care system new therapeutic approaches for HF are still critically needed. The potential positive impact of these studies is that preventing T-tubule dysfunction may represent a novel mechanism-based approach to improve health care outcomes related to HF. Understanding these molecular mechanisms will provide a novel platform for T-tubule-targeted therapies that prevent HF development and progression.","Acute myocardial infarction;Animal Model;Attenuated;Blood;Calpain;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cell model;Cells;Data;Death Sudden Cardiac;Development;Down-Regulation;Electrophysiology (science);Event;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Heart;Heart Diseases;Heart failure;Hospitalization;Human;Hypertrophy;Image;In Situ;In Vitro;Infusion procedures;Isoproterenol;Measurement;Mediating;Membrane;Molecular;Molecular Biology;Mus;Muscle Cells;Myocardial Infarction;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Phosphotransferases;Process;Pump;Recombinants;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Stress;Structural Genes;Surface;System;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Tubular formation;Ventricular;advanced disease;base;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;improved;in vivo;interdisciplinary approach;junctophilin;meetings;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;pressure;prevent;targeted treatment","Junctophilin-2 dysregulation and T-tubule remodeling in heart failure","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  As heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 and causes an enormous burden on our health care system new therapeutic approaches for HF are still critically needed.

"Clinical Research","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the NIMG R25 program is to support educational activities that complement and/or enhance the training of a workforce to meet the nation's biomedical behavioral and clinical research needs. This funding opportunity encourages activities and outreach programs with a primary focus on courses for skills development structured mentoring activities and outreach programs to create a highly skilled and diverse workforce. A major challenge facing the toxicology profession is a lack of a diversified workforce. Although the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has recognized this problem for many years and indeed has tried to address it through different funding mechanisms the number of underrepresented minorities in the toxicology profession remains disappointingly low. One of the shortcomings of recruiting undergraduates into the toxicology graduate research programs is a lack of undergraduate toxicology training programs in the country. Toxicology is taught starting at graduate level. Because of lack of awareness and knowledge about the discipline and its role in the protection of human animal and environmental health undergraduates with interest in pursuing graduate education naturally will not consider it as an option. Iowa State University in Ames IA is collaborating with Tuskegee University Tuskegee AL to create a one-year long proof-of-concept undergraduate toxicology mentoring and skills development training program. There are two specific aims for the program. Specific Aim #1: Development and delivery of a mentoring program to the best and brightest underrepresented undergraduate students enrolled in science technology engineering and math (STEM). The program will recruit 30 mentees per year and match them 1:1 with mentors from industry and government. This will expose mentees to real world experiences. Mentoring will consist of face-to-face activities. Specific Aim #2: Development and delivery of an online course consisting of short modules. The innovative flexible course will be accessible on mobile devices as well as from computers and will be open to the public 24/7. Expected outcomes of this unique training program include: a) building a pipeline of undergraduate students who will go on to join toxicology research graduate programs and ultimately the workforce; b) because skills imparted through this program apply to broader biomedical behavioral and clinical research enterprise students who successfully complete this program will be an asset in other areas of research interest to the NIH; and c) the online course consisting of short modules which will be open to the general public will be a significant outreach program. This is a unique and highly innovative mentoring and training program that will likely have a huge positive impact of creating a pipeline of underrepresented minorities in STEM subjects entering graduate school and ultimately the workforce. A future plan is to expand enrolment and open up the program to other Historically Black Colleges and Universities historically Hispanic colleges and universities and historically Chicano and Native American Universities.      ","Address;African American;Animals;Applied Research;Area;Awareness;Behavioral;Behavioral Research;Biomedical Research;Clinical;Clinical Research;Collaborations;Complement;Computers;Country;Development;Disadvantaged;Discipline;Diverse Workforce;Education Projects;Educational Activities;Educational process of instructing;Engineering;Enrollment;Environmental Health;Exposure to;Funding;Funding Mechanisms;Funding Opportunities;Future;General Population;Genetic;Goals;Government;Graduate Education;Health;Hispanics;Historically Black Colleges and Universities;Human;Individual;Industry;Iowa;Knowledge;Life;Mentors;Mexican Americans;Minority;Minority Groups;National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences;Native Americans;Organism;Outcome;Poisons;Qualifying;Recruitment Activity;Research;Role;Schools;Science;Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics;Skills Development;Societies;Structure;Students;Toxic Environmental Substances;Toxicology;Training;Training Activity;Training Programs;Underrepresented Minority;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Work;career;cohort;college;experience;flexibility;handheld mobile device;innovation;interest;job market;meetings;minority undergraduate;multidisciplinary;online course;outreach;outreach program;programs;public health relevance;response;skill acquisition;skills;success;toxicant;undergraduate student;underrepresented minority student","Toxicology Mentoring and Skills Development Training Program","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   There is a critical lack of underrepresented minorities in the nation's biomedical behavioral and clinical workforce.

Toxicology a multidisciplinary field has a critical need to increase the number of minorities in its workforce. African Americans and other socially disadvantaged groups experience higher exposure to environmental toxicants and because of genetic differences response to toxicants is sometimes different.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and visual disability that has a major impact on the quality of life and productivity of millions o Americans. With no new pharmaceutical classes for treating glaucoma introduced into clinical practice since the 1990s there remains a continuing need for improved regimes that treat glaucoma more effectively. Our long-term goal is to contribute to the development of these improved therapies by utilizing synergistic genetic approaches with mice and humans. Here we focus on a sub-type of glaucoma pigmentary glaucoma and its major risk factor pigment dispersion syndrome. Pigment dispersion is an alarmingly common condition characterized by aberrant release and collection of pigment throughout the anterior chamber of the eye. In most people pigment dispersion causes no significant problems. However in others pigment dispersion leads to elevated intraocular pressure and pigmentary glaucoma. The factors initiating pigment dispersion and determining these very different potential outcomes are largely unknown. Our central hypothesis is that dispersed pigment elicits active modifiable physiological responses by the trabecular meshwork that are shaped by genetics and that dictate whether or not the insult progresses to secondary glaucoma. Using human genetics we are studying families affected by pigment dispersion to identify genetic factors causing initiationof pigment dispersion. Using approaches with mice we have developed an inducible mouse model for studying physiological responses to pigment dispersion and identified genetic suppressors of pigmentary glaucoma for studying potential treatments. Our objective in this proposal is to utilize and build on these resources to study molecular events contributing to pigment dispersion and its conversion to pigmentary glaucoma.

"Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Diabetes; Dietary Supplements; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Nutrition; Peripheral Neuropathy; Prevention","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Good glycemic control is the only recognized treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) but studies have shown that it only slows progression. Therefore other factors besides hyperglycemia must contribute to DPN and there is a need for a better understanding of what these factors are in order to discover effective treatments. In the proposed studies we will test the hypothesis that different fatty acid classes have either a negative neutral or positive effect on DPN. Lipids have been shown to be a major risk factor for diseases but there has been no comprehensive analysis of the effect of different classes of fatty acids on DPN. We will use novel rodent models of type 2 diabetes and manipulate diets so as to increase circulating and tissue levels of monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids. Specifically we will examine the potential negative neutral or positive benefits of dietary enrichment with oleic acid (18:1 MUFA) linoleic acid (18:2 n-6 PUFA) -linolenic acid (18:3 n-6 PUFA) -linolenic acid (18:3 n-3 PUFA) or eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 EPA n-3 PUFA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 DHA n-3 PUFA) on DPN and neurovascular function. The DPN endpoints will include determination of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity and changes in the density and function of small sensory nerves in the skin and cornea. The latter endpoints will allow us to examine the effect of fatty acid dietarychanges on nerve damage or repair. It is expected that supplementing diets of diabetic rodents with oils enriched in oleic acid (olive oil) or linoleic acid (safflower oil) will have little beneicial effect or may even exacerbate DPN and neurovascular dysfunction. Diets supplemented with - linolenic acid (evening primrose oil) or -linolenic acid (flaxseed oil) are expected to be beneficial but to a lesser extent than diets supplemented with EPA and DHA to be derived from menhaden (fish) oil. We propose that increasing dietary levels of n-3 PUFA (derived from flaxseed oil or menhaden oil) but not - linolenic acid (n-6 PUFA derived from evening primrose oil) will lower the n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio a marker for reduced inflammation. Due to reduced ability in diabetes of conversion of -linolenic acid to EPA we predict that increasing dietary levels of EPA and DHA but not -linolenic acid will lead to an increased production of resolvins. Resolvins are produced from EPA and DHA by 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) and have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. We propose that EPA and DHA treatment of rodents with type 2 diabetes will have the greatest impact on DPN through reducing inflammatory stress improving neurovascular function and mediating nerve repair. We also propose that treating rodents with salicylsalicylic acid (salsalate) will increase tissue expressio of 15-LOX-1 leading to increased production of resolvins and even greater efficacy toward DPN and neurovascular complications when rodents with type 2 diabetes are treated with the combination of salsalate and menhaden oil. These preclinical studies will provide needed information to justify clinical trials for the treatment of DPN with fish oils and salsalate.      ","Acids;Adverse effects;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase;Aspirin;Biopsy;Blood Circulation;Blood Vessels;Blood flow;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical;Clinical Treatment;Clinical Trials;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Confocal Microscopy;Cornea;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Diet;Diabetic mouse;Diet;Dietary Fatty Acid;Disease;Docosahexaenoic Acids;Eicosapentaenoic Acid;Etiology;Family;Fatty Acids;Fish Oils;Functional disorder;Health Care Costs;Hemorrhage;Hyperglycemia;Immunohistochemistry;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Intervention;Lead;Linoleic Acids;Linseed Oil;Lipids;Lipoxygenase 1;Mediating;Menhaden oil;Modeling;Motor;N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid;Nerve;Nerve Fibers;Nerve Regeneration;Neural Conduction;Neurites;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Oils;Oleic Acids;Olive oil preparation;Omega-3 Fatty Acids;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oxidative Stress;Patients;Peripheral Nerves;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids;Principal Investigator;Prodrugs;Production;Property;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Rattus;Risk;Risk Factors;Rodent;Rodent Model;Safety;Safflower Oil;Salicylic Acids;Series;Serum;Severities;Skin;Stomach;Stress;Testing;Tissues;afferent nerve;alpha-Linolenic Acid;arteriole;density;diabetic;diabetic rat;effective therapy;evening primrose oil;gamma-Linolenic Acid;glycemic control;improved;insulin sensitivity;irritation;lipid mediator;neurovascular;novel;preclinical study;programs;public health relevance;relating to nervous system;repaired;salicylsalicylic acid;sciatic nerve","Effect of exogenous fatty acids on diabetes neural/neurovascular complications","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Good glycemic control is not sufficient to manage diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) suggesting other factors contribute to its etiology and with the increasing rate of type 2 diabetes DPN and other diabetes complications will continue to increase the cost of healthcare and negatively impact the quality of life for patient and family. Thus there is a need to determine what these other factors are in order to discover an effective treatment for DPN. We will investigate the impact dietary fatty acids have on DPN as well as explore whether n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA)) will slow progression and stimulate repair of peripheral nerves by reducing inflammatory and oxidative stress and increasing the formation of EPA and DHA metabolites; resolvins and neuroprotectin.             ","NIDDK","8998166","11/23/2015","PA-13-302","1R01DK107399-01","1","R01","DK","107399","01","","JONES, TERESA L Z","12/1/2015","11/30/2019","Clinical Neuroplasticity and Neurotransmitters Study Section[CNNT]"," ","1878588","YOREK, MARK A.","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2015","11/30/2016"," ","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","283500"," ","NIDDK","225000","58500"," ","283500",
"Aging; Brain Disorders; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Parkinson's Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroinflammation has been implicated as a major pathophysiological process of Parkinson's disease (PD) in recent years. Among various neuroinflammatory triggers protein aggregates have been shown to be a predominant pathological trigger for microglial activation and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in the brain which in turn con tributes to the accelerated progression of neurodegenerative processes. Also emerging evidence indicates that aggregated pathogenic proteins including -synuclein (Syn) are packaged into exosomes which propagate protein aggregates from affected neurons to other brain cells including microglial cells through a non-cellular autonomous process leading to a heightened neuroinflammatory response. Despite these advances the cellular mechanisms underlying microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory events following stimulation with Syn aggregates and Syn-containing exosomes are yet to be defined. While studying kinase signaling in PD models we unexpectedly discovered that the major non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn is rapidly activated in primary microglia within a few minutes of stimulation with the known inflammogen LPS. Interestingly Fyn activation triggers proinflammatory responses including cytokine/chemokine release from microglia. In addition our preliminary findings revealed that aggregated Syn also induced a rapid activation of Fyn kinase and the NLRP3 inflammasome. To further expand our novel preliminary results we will systematically pursue the following specific aims: (i) to characterize the mechanism of Fyn kinase activation and its role in the regulation of NLRRP2/3 inflammasomes in microglia and astrocytes during inflammatory stress induced by Syn aggregates and exosomes containing Syn aggregates and to determine the proinflammatory role of Fyn in dopaminergic neuronal cell death (ii) to define the molecular mechanisms underlying Fyn upregulation in microglia and astroglia during sustained inflammatory responses induced by Syn aggregates and Syn exosomes in animal models of PD and (iii) to determine the role of Fyn in mediating the proinflammatory response in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system during Syn protein aggregation in animal models of PD as well as in postmortem PD brain tissues. Biochemical cellular and neurochemical approaches will be used to achieve these specific aims. Taken together delineating the role of Fyn kinase in Syn protein aggregation-induced microglial activation will not only provide novel mechanistic insights into the progression of neurodegenerative processes in PD but may also be useful for translating mechanistic outcomes into effective therapies for PD.","Address;Affect;Animal Model;Animals;Astrocytes;Autopsy;Biochemical;Brain;Brain region;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Chronic;Data;Development;Disease model;Dopamine;Event;Exposure to;Functional disorder;Goals;Health;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-1 beta;Knockout Mice;Maps;Mediating;Microglia;Modeling;Mole the mammal;Molecular;Mus;Nerve Degeneration;Neuroglia;Neurons;Outcome;Outcome Study;Parkinson Disease;Pathway interactions;Phosphotransferases;Play;Process;Production;Protein Kinase;Protein Tyrosine Kinase;Proteins;Proteus;Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn;Regulation;Resistance;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Stress;System;Time;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;Translating;Up-Regulation;Viral;Wit;alpha synuclein;brain cell;brain tissue;chemokine;cytokine;effective therapy;exosome;genetic approach;in vivo;insight;mRNA Expression;man;mutant;neurochemistry;neuroinflammation;neuron loss;neurotoxic;nigrostriatal system;nigrostriatum;novel;novel therapeutics;parkin gene/protein;promoter;protein aggregate;protein aggregation;research study;response;transcription factor","Exosomes and Neuroinflammation in Parkinsons Disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuroinflammation plays a major role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease characterized by persistent activation of microglia resulting in excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Neurosciences","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders and the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. Different memory systems typically combine and interact to influence everyday behavior. The amygdala and cerebellum have traditionally been viewed as essential players in different types of memory emotional and motor memory respectively. These memory systems have been viewed as largely independent. However recent evidence suggests that the amygdala facilitates cerebellar learning. Our preliminary data indicate that reversible inactivatio of the amygdala in rats severely impairs acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning a type of cerebellar learning. Moreover amygdala inactivation reversibly impairs the development of learning-related neuronal activity in the cerebellum. This proposal is designed to elucidate themechanisms underlying interactions between the amygdala and cerebellum. Aim 1 is to determine how the amygdala influences cerebellar function during eyeblink conditioning using reversible inactivation of the amygdala and multi-electrode neuronal recording in the cerebellum. Aim 2 is to determine whether or not the amygdala interacts with the cerebellum through the conditioned stimulus input pathway to the cerebellum using reversible inactivation of the amygdala axonal tracing electrical brain stimulation and multi-electrode neuronal recording. Aim 3 is to determine whether or not amygdala memory consolidation is necessary for facilitating cerebellar learning using protein synthesis inhibition and NMDA receptor blockade in the amygdala and multi-electrode neuronal recording in the pontine nucleus. This project would provide an unprecedented analysis of amygdala-cerebellum interactions.","Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Amygdaloid structure;Anisomycin;Behavior;Bicycling;Bilateral;Blinking;Bypass;Cell Nucleus;Cerebellum;Conditioned Stimulus;Contralateral;Data;Development;Electric Stimulation;Electrical Stimulation of the Brain;Electrodes;Emotional;Fright;Health;Ipsilateral;Lateral;Learning;Lesion;Memory;Memory impairment;Motor;Muscimol;N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors;Nature;Neurons;Pathway interactions;Performance;Play;Pontine structure;Process;Protein Biosynthesis;Protein Synthesis Inhibition;Rattus;Research;Role;Sensory;Shock;Speed;Stimulus;System;Testing;Training;base;classical conditioning;conditioned fear;conditioning;design;long term memory;memory consolidation;motor learning;nervous system disorder;neural circuit;neuromechanism;novel;research study;response;stroke","Amygdala-Cerebellum Interactions During Associative Learning","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating.

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sinoatrial node (SAN) cells are cardiac pacemaker cells located in the lateral right atrium that require proper Ca2+ handling to produce a rhythmic heart rate (HR). It is well accepted that SAN cells rely on slow depolarizing If channels sarcoplasmic Ca2+ release and modulation of intracellular Ca2+ by membrane ion channels to modulate HR. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is a newly identified 40 kDa protein that is responsible for Ca2+ influx into mitochondria. I found that inhibiting MCU with the antagonist drug RU360 blocks isolated SAN cells from increasing beating frequency in response to isoproterenol a -adrenergic receptor agonist. This outcome was reversed when ATP was perfused in the pipette solution. Based on these data I hypothesize that mitochondrial Ca2+ is a required signal for SAN cells to respond to isoproterenol and that inhibiting MCU prevents mitochondria from matching energy supply with demand. Sinus node dysfunction (SND) is a clinical condition marked by dysregulation of the primary cardiac pacemaker slowing of the HR and increased risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. At present the only treatment for SND is surgical implantation of a permanent pacemaker which costs 2 billion dollars annually and is associated with numerous morbidities. Our lab recently reported a novel mechanism in which angiotensin II (Ang II) infused mice developed SND due to SAN cell death. Mitochondrial Ca2+ is a required signal for regulation of metabolic processes but excessive mitochondrial Ca2+ load can lead to mitochondrial induced cell death. Here I will test the novel concept that the MCU is a gatekeeper for mitochondrial Ca2+ entry but with the potential to permit mitochondrial Ca2+ overload cell death and SND. I developed mice with genetic MCU inhibition by myocardial-delimited transgenic expression of a dominant-negative MCU. I will use these new mice to test the potential role of MCU in SAN physiology and in Ang-II induced SND. To my knowledge this will be the first in vivo study of the MCU in cardiac tissue. The goal of thi work is to determine how mitochondrial Ca2+ contributes to cardiac pacing and explore the effect of MCU inhibition in an Ang II infusion model of SND. My studies will test the hypothesized role of the MCU in SAN physiology and disease using two Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the physiologic effects of inhibiting Ca2+ influx through the MCU. Aim 2: Determine whether MCU inhibition affects physiological HR responses and/or protects against SAN cell death and SND in vivo.","Adenoviruses;Adrenergic Agents;Adrenergic Agonists;Affect;Angiotensin II;Arrhythmia;Artificial cardiac pacemaker;Bioenergetics;Calcium;Cardiac;Cause of Death;Cell Death;Cell membrane;Cells;Clinical;Data;Disease;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Energy Supply;Failure;Fellowship;Frequencies;Functional disorder;Future;Gatekeeping;Genes;Genetic;Goals;Health;Heart Diseases;Heart Rate;Heart failure;Homeostasis;Implant;Infusion procedures;Ion Channel;Isoproterenol;Knowledge;Laboratories;Lateral;Lead;Learning;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Myocardial;Operative Surgical Procedures;Outcome;Oxidoreductase;Pacemakers;Paint;Pathologic Processes;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Physiological Processes;Physiology;Play;Procedures;Proteins;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reagent;Regulation;Renin;Renin-Angiotensin System;Reporting;Right atrial structure;Risk;Role;Ru 360;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Signal Transduction;Sinoatrial Node;Sinus;Stimulus;Sudden Death;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;United States;Wild Type Mouse;Woman;Work;base;calcium uniporter;cardiac pacing;cost;implantation;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;insight;men;new therapeutic target;nodal myocyte;novel;pre-doctoral;prevent;protective effect;research study;response;uptake","The mitochondrial calcium uniporter in sinus node physiology and disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Proper Ca2+ handling in the sinoatrial node (SAN) is required to produce a rhythmic heart rate and important for responding to adrenergic stimuli. The recent identification of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter has allowed me to study how blocking Ca2+ entry into mitochondria effects SAN pacemaking. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States and worldwide. Sinus node dysfunction (SND) is a condition marked by inability for propagation of electrical stimuli to surrounding tissues and canresult from heart failure a relatively common form of heart disease marked by an activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Patients with SND show a slowing of heart rate increased risk for arrhythmias and heightened risk of sudden death. Currently there are no preventative or pharmacologic therapies for SND. The only treatment for SND is surgical implantation of a permanent pacemaker a practice that costs over 2 billion dollars annually and has associated morbidities. My studies will test the novel hypothesis that mitochondrial Ca2+ is required for physiologic cardiac pacemaking but in excess mitochondrial Ca2+ causes angiotensin II-induced sinoatrial cell death and SND. The goal for this work is to determine how mitochondrial Ca2+ contributes to cardiac pacemaking and SND.

"Bioengineering","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An important current goal in molecular biophysics is to determine the extent to which protein behavior observed in vitro is reflective of that occurringin vivo. Experimental approaches based on ""in-cell"" NMR and fluorescence techniques are beginning to bridge the gaps in knowledge but such studies can present significant technical challenges in terms of execution resolution and interpretation; in addition they typically allow only one or a few types of macromolecule to be studied at a time. To provide a complement to these experimental approaches the purpose of this proposal is to develop a Brownian dynamics (BD) simulation method capable of modeling intracellular environments at a near-atomic level of resolution and to apply the method to simulate key aspects of protein behavior in a model of the cytoplasm of the prokaryote Escherichia coli. The simulation method will allow all macromolecules to be treated as fully flexible thereby allowing protein folding events in vivo to be modeled and will provide a rigorous modeling of the hydrodynamic interactions that are crucial to include if the diffusional properties of macromolecules are to be accurately captured. Three Specific Aims will be pursued. In Aim 1 a comprehensive parallelized coarse-grained (CG) BD simulation method will be completed that allows large-scale biomolecular systems to be modeled. The proposed work will involve (a) the implementation of a novel method for modeling hydrodynamic interactions on a very large scale and (b) parallelization of the simulation code so that it runs efficiently on common distributed-memory computer clusters. In Aim 2 a comprehensive force field for use in CG simulations of protein/RNA systems will be derived for use with the simulation code developed in Aim 1. Importantly parameterization of the force field will be performed in two fundamentally different ways: 'top down' using experimental data on the thermodynamics of weak macromolecular interactions and 'bottom up' using all-atom explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation data. In addition to being parameterized in a comprehensive way the derived CG force field will be unique in also having its hydrodynamic parameters explicitly parameterized. Finally in Aim 3 the methods developed in Aims 1 and 2 will be used to perform a series of simulation studies examining fundamental aspects of protein behavior in the highly crowded conditions encountered in vivo. BD simulations of protein folding thermodynamics in concentrated single-protein solutions will be compared with the results of H/D exchange measurements. BD simulations of protein diffusion in a model of the cytoplasm of E. coli will be aimed at reproducing in silico the results of 'in-cel' NMR and fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching (FRAP) experiments also performed in E. coli. Finally BD simulations of the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding in the E. coli cytoplasm will also be carried out and compared with corresponding experimental data.

"Biotechnology; Genetics","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Project Summary A double stand break is a type of DNA damage which involves the severing of one DNA molecule into two parts. Unrepaired breaks are harmful to living organisms since they lead to cell death. However cells that do repair their breaks can also suffer detrimental outcomes if the repair is associated with DNA alteration. Repair pathways can be error free restoring the DNA to its pristine condition or error-prone leading to mistakes in DNA repair. Thelatter may lead to chromosomal abnormalities frequently associated with changes in gene structure and regulation. The effects of these errors on chromosome structure and gene regulation often promote tumors and are frequently found in cells of cancer patient. A low level of DNA breaks occur due to normal cellular process and some are environmentally induced (for example radiation therapy and/or chemotherapeutic drugs). If this damage is not properly repaired it can contribute to cancer reoccurrence. Understanding processes involved in how a particular DNA repair mechanism is selected will be fundamental for determining how cancer progresses as well as for cancer treatment. The long-term goal of this research is to identify mechanisms involved in selecting an error-free repair vs. an error-prone repair pathway. This proposal focuses on identifying proteins and mechanisms involved in this choice. Studies are proposed to understand how processing of double stand break affects such a decision. We will use C. elegans a multi- cellular animal model system which allows us to preform genetic assays for DNA repair in whole organism at a low cost and with efficient time scale. Using a newly identified mutant in a key repair gene we will examine DNA processing independently of DNA damage in the C. elegans germline. Furthermore we will identify new mechanisms directly regulating a key protein involved in this processing. To complement this analysis we will study the germline as a model for the cell-cycle control of DNA processing by designing a system for targeting DNA damage to particular regions of the germline. The conservation of genes and pathways between this animal model and humans will serve as efficient approach for discovery of genes in humans affecting the formation and progression of cancer. Understanding how accurate versus error-prone pathways are selected will be essential for developing anti-cancer therapies utilizing DNA damage to destroy cancer cells without harming healthy non-cancerous cells.      ","Accounting;Address;Affect;Alleles;Animal Model;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biological Models;Caenorhabditis elegans;Cancer Patient;Candidate Disease Gene;Catalytic Domain;Cell Cycle Proteins;Cell Cycle Regulation;Cell Death;Cell Nucleus;Cell physiology;Cells;Cellular biology;Characteristics;Chromatin;Chromosomal translocation;Chromosome Structures;Chromosome abnormality;Complement;Complex;DNA;DNA Damage;DNA Double Strand Break;DNA Repair;DNA Sequence Alteration;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Double Strand Break Repair;Excision;Future;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Fusion;Gene Structure;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Epistasis;Genetic Screening;Genome;Genomic Instability;Goals;Human;Lead;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Mammals;Measures;Meiosis;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Morbidity - disease rate;Nonhomologous DNA End Joining;Organism;Outcome;Participant;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Play;Prevention;Process;Property;Proteins;Public Health;RNA interference screen;Radiation therapy;Reagent;Regulation;Replication Error;Research;Role;Single-Stranded DNA;System;Testing;Time;Translational Research;V(D)J Recombination;Whole Organism;Yeasts;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chromatin modification;cost;design;ds-DNA;gene conservation;gene discovery;gene repair;genome integrity;homologous recombination;improved;insertion/deletion mutation;insight;mutant;novel;prevent;programs;protein complex;public health relevance;repaired;therapy design;tumor;tumor progression;yeast two hybrid system","An organismal approach to dissecting the mechanism of DSB repair pathway choice","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Project Narrative The findings of these proposed studies will benefit public health by enhancing the understanding of DNA repair which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome.

"Autoimmune Disease; Brain Disorders; Multiple Sclerosis; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): C57BL/6 mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) develop acute and chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis and thereby serve as a useful model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Demyelination is largely immune-mediated and reflects a balance between pro-inflammatory factors necessary for virus clearance and anti-inflammatory factors critical for limiting bystander tissue damage. Virus clearance requires robust virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses. In the previous funding period we showed that optimization of the CD8 T cell response by mutating a subdominant CD8 T cell epitope enhanced virus clearance. However disease course was not changed. We showed that this was due to a pathogenic CD4 T cell response directed at the immunodominant M133 epitope. Only naive M133-specific CD4 T cells were pathogenic because we also showed that memory virus-specific CD4 T cells were protective. We also identified a potent regulatory T cell (Treg Foxp3+) response directed against the M133 epitope adding another layer of complexity to the balance between pro and anti-inflammatory factors. To probe these interactions in more detail we developed mice that were retrogenic or transgenic for expression of an M133-specific T cell receptor. The central objective of this proposal is to investigate in more detail the balance of these immune factors asdelineated in the following specific aims. In Aim 1 factors in M133-specific CD4 T cells that result in pathogenicity (naive T cells) or protection (memory T cells) will be investigated using our newly developed M133-specific retrogenic and transgenic TCR mice. Adoptive transfer experiments and targeted and genome-wide gene expression approaches will be used in this aim. In Aim 2 the role of M133-specific Tregs in pathogenesis in JHMV-infected mice will be investigated also taking advantage of the M133- specific TCR transgenic mice. As part of this aim we will assess whether virus-specific Tregs are more suppressive than bulk Treg populations and whether Tregs enter the memory T cell pool. We will also determine whether pathogen-specific Tregs require expression of a second TCR  chain recognizing a self epitope for suppressive function.","Acute;Adoptive Transfer;Anti-Inflammatory Agents;Anti-inflammatory;Binding;C57BL/6 Mouse;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Central Nervous System Viral Diseases;Chronic;Clinical;Demyelinating Diseases;Demyelinations;Disease;Disease Outcome;Encephalitis;Encephalomyelitis;Epitopes;Equilibrium;Funding;Gene Expression;Hepatitis;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunosuppressive Agents;Inflammatory;Kinetics;Mediating;Memory;Modeling;Mouse Strains;Multiple Sclerosis;Murine hepatitis virus;Mus;Mutate;Mutation;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Phase;Population;Property;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Resolution;Role;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;T-Lymphocyte Epitopes;Tissues;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Virus;cytotoxic;genome-wide;human disease;immunopathology;memory CD4 T lymphocyte;neurotropic;pathogen;prevent;research study;response","Role of CD4 T cell response in MHV-induced demyelination","Demyelination which occurs after many viral infections of the central nervous system is largely mediated by the host immune response during virus clearance.

"Cardiovascular; Heart Disease","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart failure is an enormous public health problem in the United States. Over the past two decades there has been considerable progress in the treatment of chronic heart failure yet even with the best of modern therapy heart failure is stil associated with a 5-year mortality rate of 50%. Therefore the search for new approaches to treatment and prevention of heart failure is one of the major challenges in medicine.  The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel one of the most abundant cardiac membrane protein complexes has the unique ability to adjust membrane excitability in response to changes in the energetic status of the cell. When activated by increased cellular metabolic demand KATP channel-dependent potassium efflux shortens cardiac action potential duration (APD). This potassium efflux limits sodium and calcium entry into the cell and thus reduces energy requirements for ion homeostasis and contraction as well as prolongs the diastolic interval that supports myocardial relaxation and replenishment of ATP. Our recent work uncovered that that the ability of the heart to optimize APD and energy utilization depends on the membrane expression level of KATP channels which affects how quickly and efficiently KATP current can adapt to changes in workload. A complete understanding of mechanisms that control membrane KATP channel expression may reveal new avenues to promote cardiac energy efficiency and resistance to heart failure.  Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that membrane KATP channel expression is coupled with overall cardiac function by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). This densely expressed multifunctional kinase targets numerous proteins involved in excitation contraction coupling and excitability to support enhanced cardiac performance while its persistent activation under pathophysiological conditions promotes cardiomyocyte death and dysfunction. We propose a previously unrecognized downstream signaling pathway of CaMKII activation through phosphorylation of the Kir6.2 pore-forming KATP channel subunit and consequent endocytosis of KATP channels. Under persistent CaMKII activation the consequent reduction in KATP channel expression would aggravate depletion of cardiac energy resources thus contributing to myocardial injury cell death and heart failure. We predict that the known beneficial effects on cardiac stress resistance that occur with CaMKII inhibition will depend significantly on membrane retention of KATP channels.  In Aim1 we will define the mechanism for CaMKII-dependent endocytosis of KATP channels by use of tagged recombinant KATP channel subunits confocal immunofluorescence imaging and molecular biology and patch clamp techniques in cardiomyocytes and HEK293T cells. In Aim 2 we will study heart failure induced in genetic mouse models with KATP channel expression deficits and cardioselective CaMKII inhibition to understand the role of CaMKII-dependent KATP channel expression regulation in the generation of the energetic and functional deficits defining heart failure.","Acceleration;Action Potentials;Adaptor Signaling Protein;Address;Affect;Binding;Biology;Calcium;Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase;Cardiac;Cardiac Myocytes;Cardiac Output;Cell Death;Cell membrane;Cells;Cessation of life;Congestive Heart Failure;Consumption;Coupled;Coupling;Data;Development;Down-Regulation;Endocytosis;Energy Metabolism;Figs - dietary;Functional disorder;Generations;Genetic;Goals;Heart;Heart Rate;Heart failure;Homeostasis;Image;Immunofluorescence Immunologic;Incidence;Infarction;Injury;Ion Channel;Ions;Laboratories;Mechanics;Medicine;Membrane;Membrane Proteins;Metabolic;Molecular Biology;Myocardial;Myocardial dysfunction;Organ;Outcome;Patch-Clamp Techniques;Performance;Phosphorylation;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Potassium;Prevention;Production;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;Recombinants;Regulation;Relaxation;Resistance;Resources;Role;Signal Pathway;Site;Sodium;Stress;Surface;Testing;Transcription Factor AP-2 Alpha;United States;Ventricular;Work;Workload;adapter protein;base;calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;combat;cost;energy balance;improved;mortality;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;pressure;protein complex;response","Control of KATP channel expression by CaMKII: role in heart failure resistance","Heart failure is an enormous public health problem in the United States where the incidence and mortality are high such that the search for new approaches to treatment and prevention is one of the major challenges in medicine.

"Asthma; Bioengineering; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; Clinical Research; Diagnostic Radiology; Lung","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biomarkers of regional lung function coupled with validated low dose methods of assessing anatomic features of the lung are critical to promote discovery and testing of new interventions in COPD and asthma. This proposed bioengineering research partnership seeks to take advantage of the emerging acquisition technique of multi-spectral computed tomography (currently dual energy CT: DECT) careful evaluation of dose lowering methods and novel approaches to statistical cluster anlaysis to expand the biomarkers used in multi-center studies to identify sub-populations of lung disease. Current CT methods have focused largely on parenchymal destruction air trapping and airway remodeling. With our recent findings reported in the Proceedings of the National Acedemy of Sciences and the New England Journal of Medicine there is growing evidence that the etiology of emphysema may be correlated with abnormal vascular responses to inflammation in COPD. To further validate these findings we focus on multi-spectral CT to simplify the current dynamic CT approach in its assessment of ventilation and perfusion. With DECT we can simplify to a single breath of xenon gas or a slow peripheral injection of iodinated contrast agent to assess regional ventilation or perfused blood volume (PBV). Our approach consists of 5 tightly integrated aims seeking to: 1) establish the minimum dose required to achieve the measurements of importance in defining COPD and asthma sub-populations; 2) use our well characterized CT assessment of pulmonary perfusion and ventilation using dynamic axial imaging to validate metrics from DECT providing indices of ventilation and perfusion via single breath hold / single lung volume techniques; 3) expand image segmentation of the lung to the pulmonary arterial and venous trees to further link structure to function as well as to reliabily provide a framework for dividing the lung into sublobar segments as the standard region of interest; 4) test the application of a novel statistica approach to cluster analysis such that the measures from quantitative CT fully account for specific phenotypes for disease subgroups and link to a computational fluid dynamics model such that a putative phenotype can be better understood; and finally 5) provide a framework whereby newly developed protocols are harmonized across manufacturers and scanner models allowing for cross institutional data collection and a means whereby technology is allowed to progress within the context of longitudial studies.","Accounting;Adherence;Air;Algorithms;Anatomy;Asthma;Back;Biological Markers;Biomedical Engineering;Blood Vessels;Blood Volume;Blood flow;Calibration;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Cluster Analysis;Computer software;Contrast Media;Coupled;Data Collection;Development;Disease;Dose;Environmental air flow;Equipment;Etiology;Evaluation;Functional Imaging;Gases;Genotype;Health;Heterogeneity;Image;Image Analysis;Imaging Techniques;Inflammation;Injection of therapeutic agent;Intervention;Journals;Link;Liquid substance;Lung;Lung CAT Scan;Lung diseases;Manufacturer Name;Measurement;Measures;Medicine;Methodology;Methods;Modeling;Multicenter Studies;Multicenter Trials;New England;Noise;Pathologic Processes;Pathology;Perfusion;Peripheral;Phenotype;Population;Process;Protocols documentation;Pulmonary Emphysema;Radiation;Reporting;Research;Respiratory physiology;Scanning;Science;Smoking;Staging;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Subgroup;Techniques;Technology;Testing;Time;Trees;Venous;X-Ray Computed Tomography;Xenon;airway remodeling;base;computerized tools;detector;disease phenotype;disorder subtype;endothelial dysfunction;feeding;imaging Segmentation;imaging biomarker;indexing;inflammatory lung disease;insight;interest;lung imaging;lung volume;new technology;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;outcome prediction;physiologic stressor;reconstruction;response;tool","Multi-center Structural & Functional Quantitative CT Pulmonary Phenotyping","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Quantitative x-ray CT of lung structure has been successful in providing objective methods for detecting early lung disease and dividing subjects into sub-groups to aid in seeking new therapies for COPD and asthma.

"Biodefense; Clinical Research; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gram-negative bacteria frequently cause infections in humans. An abundant glycolipid found in the outer membrane of these bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) forms an integral part of their structure and modulates multiple interactions with the immune system during infection. It has become clear in recent years that many Gram-negative pathogens alter the structure of their LPS during adaptation to the host in order to optimize immune evasion. This proposal seeks to apply novel experimental approaches to understand better the mechanisms and consequences of lipid A structural modification by Francisella during intracellular growth. This would represent the first detailed description of LPSadaptation in a cytosolic pathogen.  Unlike the LPS of many medically-important Gram-negative microbes Francisella LPS is non- inflammatory. It neither stimulates nor antagonizes LPS-sensing host machinery and we have previously documented that it fails to interact with important LPS-sensing molecules that normally promote efficient elimination of Gram-negative bacteria. These unique characteristics likely derive from its unusual lipid A and core polysaccharide structures. The overall composition of Francisella LPS is also highly unusual in that a majority of the LPS molecules consist of free lipid A lacking both core and O-antigen polysaccharides. The precise structural determinants of the inertness of Francisella LPS and the functional consequences of the presence of so much hydrophobic free lipid A are not fully understood.  The presence of a large population of hydrophobic LPS molecules complicates some aspects of structural analysis and in response to this challenge we have developed a means to label replicating Francisella with [14C]acetate in both laboratory media and within human phagocytes. The label is incorporated into fatty acids providing a sensitive quantitative method to analyze the structure of Francisella LPS in detail. Mounting evidence indicates that among the adaptations made by Francisella as it invades and disseminates are changes in the structural composition of its lipid A/LPS. The methods we have developed to label isolate and quantify lipid A/LPS molecules based on specific structural characteristics will permit a detailed analysis of modulation of innate immunity by Francisella.  Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that Francisella alters the structure of its lipid A during adaptation to the cytosol o mammalian cells and that these changes result in a lipid A with distinct properties that facilitat evasion of innate immunity. To test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims: 1. Characterize the determinants of lipid A heterogeneity of F. tularensis 2. Determine how the formation of lipid A species accumulating selectively in infected host cells is regulated 3. Determine the functional consequences of the lipid A alterations that occur during intracellular infection","Acetates;Affect;Bacteria;Cell Death;Cells;Characteristics;Cytosol;Data;Disease;Environment;Fatty Acids;Francisella;Francisella tularensis;Gene-Modified;Glycolipids;Gram-Negative Bacteria;Growth;Health;Heterogeneity;Human;Immune;Immune system;Infection;Inflammatory;Invaded;Label;Laboratories;Life;Lipid A;Lipopolysaccharides;Mammalian Cell;Membrane;Methods;Microbe;Modification;Natural Immunity;O Antigens;Organism;Phagocytes;Polysaccharides;Population;Production;Property;Structure;Surface;Testing;Tularemia;Wit;base;immunoregulation;interest;novel;pathogen;response","The Structural Determinants of Innate Immune Modulation by Francisella LPS","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Francisella tularensis is the bacterium that causes the life-threatening infection tularemia and its remarkable infectiousness prompted interest in the use of the organism as an agent of warfare.

The current objective is to examine three memory processes that support word learning: encoding consolidation and retrieval. Encoding the experience-dependent process via which a new memory is formed is followed by consolidation the slower experience-independent process via which the fragile new memory is stabilized enhanced and integrated into a network of related memories. Subsequent retrieval of the newly learned information can further strengthen the memory trace and can set in motion the processes of re-encoding and re-consolidation. The central hypothesis is that the word learning problems that characterize LI are a consequence of deficits in experience-dependent memory processes. Experience-independent processes are not affected. This deficit alone is enough to impair word learning over shorter and longer retention intervals and to result ultimately in a small and shallow vocabulary. The specific aims are to 1) determine the integrity of experience-dependent and -independent memory processes of learners with LI; 2) identify experiences that promote optimal encoding among learners with LI; and 3) describe the complex interactions between (re)encoding (re)consolidation and retention interval that culminate in poorer or stronger retention among learners with LI. The research strategy involves a series of six training experiments wherein the memorial processes that support word learning and retention are detailed across the course of a single week. Manipulation of the number and type of training exposures allows determination of optimal encoding experiences. All experiments will involve comparisons of college students with LI to college students who are unaffected. Three different schedules of testing allow measurement of encoding all three stages of consolidation and re-encoding/reconsolidation.","Accounting;Adult;Affect;Complex;Data;Development;Disadvantaged;Failure;Feedback;Funding;Goals;Impairment;Language Development;Lead;Learning;Maps;Measurement;Memory;Motion;Participant;Population;Procedures;Process;Production;Protocols documentation;Research;Retrieval;Schedule;Series;Sleep;Societies;Staging;Testing;Time;Training;United States;Vocabulary;Work;clinical investigation;college;experience;high risk;insight;language impairment;memory process;programs;research study;response;university student;word learning","Memory and Word Learning","The project will yield new insights about the word learning challenges associated with developmental language impairment (LI) a condition that affects over 12 million adults in the United States.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Depression; Mental Health; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is widely appreciated that dysregulation of brain systems controlling stress hormone function may underlie the development of major depression and other stress-related disease states. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal formation (HF) are known to negatively regulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and their dysfunction is implicated in the mood and neuroendocrine disturbances in depression and in animal studies of chronic stress. Over the years progress in developing interventions that target neuroendocrine systems has been lacking due to the inability to unravel the complex neurocircuitry and mechanisms underlying the withdrawal of mPFC and HF restraining influences following chronic stress. Our recent identification of a discrete GABAergic cell group in the anterior subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (aBST) serves as a disynaptic relay between limbic cortical and the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) and is capable of integrating these stress-inhibitory influences over HPA output during acute emotional stress allows us to directly examine the role of this novel pathway in controlling depression-related neuroendocrine changes. We hypothesize that chronic stress-induced neuroplasticity (i.e. dendritic/axonal retraction synapse/terminal loss) in mPFC leads to a disruption in their normal restraining influences on the HPA axis via decreasing their innervationof key disynaptic inhibitory relays (e.g. involving aBST) to PVH. Aim 1 will assess the involvement of this new circuit implicated in HPA axis modifications following chronic variable stress exposure and immunotoxin ablation of key GABAergic relays in these circuits will test the involvement of this pathway in chronic stress-induced endocrine alterations. Aim 2 will utilize high- resolution microscopy digital reconstructions and stereology for the assessment of structural plasticity (dendritic spine density axon terminal alterations) in mPFC/HF neurons specific to the circuitry implicated in HPA axis modifications following chronic variable stress. Aim 3 will test whether blockade of GC receptors in mPFC/HF prevents circuit-specific neuroplasticity and in turn prevent HPA axis hyperactivity following chronic variable stress. These studies are expected to (a) define a basis for inhibitory circuit disruptions implicated in the withdrawal of HPA restraining influences following chronic variable stress and (b) to assess the relationship between limbic cortical neuroplasticity and the endocrine abnormalities associated with chronic stress. It is hoped that identification of novel neuroanatomical targets and underlying cellular processes in this proposal will inform the search for more effective treatments for stress-related psychiatric and systemic disorders.","Ablation;Acute;Adrenal Glands;Adverse effects;Animals;Anterior;Atrophic;Brain;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Chronic stress;Complement;Complex;Control Groups;Data;Dendritic Spines;Development;Disease;Emotional Stress;Endocrine;Exposure to;Functional disorder;Glutamates;Goals;Hippocampal Formation;Hormones;Human;Hyperactive behavior;Hypothalamic structure;Immunotoxins;Intervention;Label;Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy;Major Depressive Disorder;Medial;Mental Depression;Microscopy;Modeling;Modification;Moods;Morphology;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Neurosecretory Systems;Output;Pathway interactions;Pituitary Gland;Pituitary-Adrenal System;Prefrontal Cortex;Presynaptic Terminals;Prevention;Regulation;Reporting;Resolution;Role;Specificity;Stress;Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region;Synapses;System;Testing;Time;Vertebral column;Withdrawal;Work;base;biological adaptation to stress;brain circuitry;density;digital;effective therapy;experience;follow-up;gamma-Aminobutyric Acid;hippocampal pyramidal neuron;hypercortisolemia;innovation;nerve supply;neural circuit;neuroimaging;novel;paraventricular nucleus;prevent;receptor;reconstruction;research study;response;stressor","Circuit and cellular mechanisms of chronic stress-induced HPA axis hyperactivity","While it is widely hypothesized that dysregulation of brain systems controlling stress hormone function may be important for understanding the pathophysiology of major depression and other stress-related disease states their underlying mechanisms have remained elusive.

"Biotechnology; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Lung","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACTObjective. Gene therapy has the potential to permanently correct or prevent monogenic disorders suchas cystic fibrosis. We have a demonstrated track record of utilizing many categories of viral and non-viralvectors to deliver genes to the airways; however choosing the best gene therapy vector leads to a verysignificant dilemma. Non-integrating vectors may not persist and integrating vectors may causeinsertional mutagenesis. There is a critical need for improved gene delivery tools that address thisconundrum. Our long-term goal is to engineer a vehicle for gene delivery to cells that is a safe andeffective therapeutic for cystic fibrosis. To this end the goal for these proposed studies is to develop anintegrating vector with a predictable integration pattern that targets 'safe harbor' genomic loci. Nonviralvector systems are used increasingly as tools for gene transfer applications. We successfully used thepiggyBac DNA transposon system as an effective integrating vector for gene transfer.Method. Based on our preliminary studies piggyBac transposase is amenable to modification.Furthermore recent advances in the ability to engineer customized zinc finger proteins make thepossibility of targeted transposition promising as a therapeutic approach. The overall hypothesis is thatthe piggyBac transposon system may be modified to retarget integration. We will use multipleapproaches to direct the piggyBac transposase to designated loci increase vector delivery efficiencyand improve the utility and safety of the vector for gene therapy. Here we propose to: 1) generate andvalidate the function of 'safe harbor' zinc finger protein/piggyBac transposase fusion proteins; 2) mapzinc finger protein/piggyBac transposase mediated transposon integrations in the genome; and 3) createa hybrid piggyBac/lentivirus vector system to improve delivery efficacy. These studies will provideimportant mechanistic information regarding the motifs important for directing piggyBac integrations.","Address;Animal Model;Binding;Bioinformatics;Categories;Cells;Chimeric Proteins;Collaborations;Cystic Fibrosis;DNA Transposable Elements;DNA Transposons;Data;Engineering;Excision;Feline Immunodeficiency Virus;Future;Gene Delivery;Gene Transduction Agent;Gene Transfer;Genes;Genetic;Genome;Genomic DNA;Genomics;Goals;Human;Hybrids;In Vitro;Insertional Mutagenesis;Integrase;Lactones;Lentivirus Vector;Maps;Mediating;Mendelian disorder;Methods;Modification;Molecular Genetics;Non-Viral Vector;Oxidases;Pattern;Plasmids;Proteins;Pseudogenes;Safety;Sequence Analysis;Site;Somatic Cell;Subfamily lentivirinae;System;Therapeutic;Transgenes;Transposase;Viral Vector;Zinc Fingers;airway epithelium;base;cellular transduction;deep sequencing;design;efficacy testing;gene therapy;gene transfer vector;improved;in vivo;mutant;novel;prevent;success;therapeutic gene;tool;vector","Targeted integration of a DNA transposon-based nonviral vector","PROJECT NARRATIVEThe successful completion of these studies will bring us closer to the long-term goal of correcting thecystic fibrosis genetic deficiency.

"Assistive Technology; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Neurosciences; Prevention; Rehabilitation","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Speech perception poses two difficult problems for listeners. First the acoustic signal is variable and context dependent making phoneme identification difficult. Second it unfolds over time and at early points in a word there may not e sufficient information to identify it. This research aims to understand how listeners solve both problems how these problems relate to each other and to use this to understand two groups of impaired listeners: listeners with Language Impairment (LI) and listeners who use Cochlear Implants (CIs). Project 1 asks how listeners compensate for variation due to talker and phonetic context and how compensation interacts with unfolding competition between candidate words that listeners momentarily consider during word recognition. It employs event related potentials to assess whether compensation occurs at the level of auditory encoding or during later categorical processes. It also uses eye-tracking to examine moment-by-moment activation of lexical competitors (how strongly listeners consider multiple words in parallel) asking when acoustic cues and compensation processes impact lexical processing. Finally it examines CI users whose difficulty identifying talkers may inhibit their compensation abilities. This may lead to better processing strategies device configurations and therapies. Project 2 examines how listeners represent the order of information in a word (e.g. how they distinguish anadromes like cat and tack). Most models use the serial order of the phonemes to exclude anadrome competitors. However recent data indicate that listeners do not completely rule out anadromes suggesting that order is not explicitly represented. Project 2 uses eye-tracking and visual world paradigm with known words and small artificial languages to determine whether listeners use fine-grained acoustic detail (differences in how a phoneme is pronounced in syllable-initial and final positions) as a proxy for order. It also examines listeners with LI who may have deficits with both fine-grained auditory detail and serial order; and CI users who lack access to fine-grained spectral detail. This will assess theories of language impairment that emphasis auditory or sequencing deficits as the source of LI. It will also help us understand the variability in outcomes among CI users and further refine our understanding of what acoustic information must be transmitted by the CI. Project 3 asks how long lexical competitors remain active during word recognition. The prior grant discovered that listeners with LI do not fully suppress lexical competitors during word recognition. Project 3 develops an eye-tracking paradigm to assess how long competitors are active and to ask what mechanisms maintain it examining inhibition between words echoic memory and phonological short-term memory. It ex- amines listeners with LI and CI users to determine the consequences of this heightened competition how it relates to other language processes and the locus of the impairment. Across all three projects this proposal aims to better characterize the underlying mechanisms of speech perception in normal listeners with the goal of using this characterization to better understand the unique problems faced by impaired listeners.","Acoustics;Address;Affect;Amines;Auditory;Auditory Perception;Categories;Cereals;Child;Clinical;Cochlear Implants;Computer Simulation;Consensus;Cues;Data;Devices;Diagnosis;Event-Related Potentials;Eye;Felis catus;Financial compensation;Goals;Grant;Hearing;Impairment;Language;Lead;Link;Maps;Memory;Modeling;Nature;Noise;Outcome;Perception;Phonetics;Population;Positioning Attribute;Problem Solving;Process;Production;Proxy;Research;Role;Short-Term Memory;Signal Transduction;Source;Speech;Speech Perception;Testing;Time;Variant;Work;coping;expectation;hearing impairment;insight;language impairment;language processing;lexical;lexical processing;phonology;specific language impairment;speech processing;theories;visual tracking","Speech perception acoustic variability and time: normal and impaired listeners","Language impairment affects as many as 8% of children and cochlear implants have become common as a treatment for hearing impairment yet we still do not understand the nature of language impairment or the reasons for the substantial variability in outcomes among CI users.

This should lead to better diagnosis and therapies for both groups and better device configuration and processing strategies for CI users.","NIDCD","8988543","12/24/2015","PA-10-067","4R01DC008089-08","4","R01","DC","008089","08","","COOPER, JUDITH ","1/8/2007","11/30/2018","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BBBP-T(02)M]"," ","8334947","MCMURRAY, BOB ","Not Applicable","01","PSYCHOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2016","11/30/2018"," ","173","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","314612"," ","NIDCD","212500","102112"," ","314612",
"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Malaria; Orphan Drug; Prevention; Rare Diseases; Vaccine Related; Vector-Borne Diseases","Abstract of research plan for MERIT extension. Memory T cell populations with a history of repeated antigen exposure will be generated in humans due to recurring infections (ie malaria influenza) chronic and latent infections (CMV EBV) and cancer. In addition many vaccines rely on multiple immunizations (prime-boost) to generate adequate levels of immunity to prevent infection. Our long-term goal is to understand the impact of antigen-exposure history on the properties ofthe resulting memory T cell populations. The significance of these studies lies in providing the basic information necessary to rationally design next generation vaccines with the capacity to protect against diseases of global import such as malaria HIV and TB that have proven intractable to current vaccine efforts and to lay the groundwork for protective vaccines against emerging and pandemic diseases. Our published and unpublished results from the initial ~3.5 year funding period of R37AI42767 reveal that repeated antigen exposure profoundly impacts patterns of gene expression in the resulting memory CD8 T cell compartment. Functional studies carried out in concert reveal that repeated antigen exposure also alters T cell localization in the steady state and negatively impacts memory maintenance and proliferative capacity in response to antigen re-encounter. Importantly we also showed that depending on the nature ofthe pathogen repeated antigen exposure can either increase or decrease the per cell protective capacity of memory CDS T cells. Despite this progress many important questions remain to be answered before we can develop ways to utilize repeated antigen-exposure to shape vaccine induced T cell responses for effective protection against specific pathogens. Thus we retain the long-term goals from our initial funding period for this proposed MERIT extension. Based on the information we generated during the initial funding period and as highlighted in the ""implications for future studies"" sections in the progress report we will focus our efforts in the MERIT extension period on three specific areas 1. Dissecting the molecular basis for diminished persistence of memory CDS T cells generated by repeated antigen stimulation. 2. Understanding how the changes in chemokines chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules induced by repeated antigen-stimulation influence the steady state and inflammatory based trafficking patterns of the resulting memory populations and how these changes influence pathogen-specific protective immunity. 3. Determining how multiple antigen-encounters regulate the T cell intrinsic and T cell extrinsic (ie access to specific APC) defects in proliferative response to reinfection. Completion of these studies will not only provide novel information regarding the impact of antigenexposure history on memory T cell but also lay the groundwork for using this information to improve vaccines.","Antigens;Area;CD8B1 gene;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Cytomegalovirus;Defect;Disease;Exposure to;Funding;Future;Gene Expression Profile;Goals;HIV/TB;Human;Human Herpesvirus 4;Immunity;Immunization;Infection;Infection prevention;Inflammatory;Influenza;Maintenance;Malaria;Malignant Neoplasms;Memory;Molecular;Nature;Pattern;Population;Progress Reports;Property;Publishing;Recording of previous events;Regulation;Research;Shapes;Study Section;T cell response;T memory cell;T-Lymphocyte;Vaccines;abstracting;base;chemokine;chemokine receptor;design;improved;latent infection;malaria infection;memory CD4 T lymphocyte;novel;novel vaccines;pandemic disease;pathogen;response;trafficking","Regulation of primary and secondary CD4 and CD8 T cell memory","n/a","NIAID","8988528","1/11/2016"," ","4R37AI042767-18","4","R37","AI","042767","18","","KELLY, HALONNA R","4/1/1998","1/31/2018","NSS"," ","1888864","HARTY, JOHN T","Not Applicable","01","MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2016","1/31/2017"," ","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","562607"," ","NIAID","371752","190855"," ","562607",

"Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Congenital Structural Anomalies; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Rare Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to continue to study a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive form of retinal degeneration known as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). BBS is a pleiotropic disorder with the primary clinical features of pigmentary retinopathy obesity polydactyly learning disabilities renal abnormalities and hypogenitalism. I is also associated with hypertension diabetes mellitus and congenital heart defects. The retinal degeneration of BBS is early onset and typically leads to blindness in the second decade of life. However there is variation in the course and severity of BBS retinopathy. At least sixteen BBS genes have been reported to date and additional BBS genes accounting for approximately 30% of cases remain to be discovered. It has been observed that the BBS phenotype varies greatly between and within families and this variability in expressivity indicates that other genes modify the phenotype. Such genetic modifiers may be the BBS genes themselves or other genes that do not independently cause BBS when mutated. The identification of additional BBS genes will be important to fully understand the role of genetic modification in this disorder and the study o BBS is useful in understanding mechanisms underlying genetic complexity. The fact that we have identified two protein complexes involved in BBS (the BBSome and the BBS chaperone complex) provides us with the opportunity to study how interactions within and between protein complexes contribute to genetic complexity at the biochemical level. In addition access to a number of animal models provides us with the opportunity to determine the potential modifying effects of other biochemical pathways on BBS phenotypes. In the proposed studies we will identify novel BBS genes (Specific Aim 1). In Specific Aim 2 we will evaluate BBS as a complex disorder in two model organisms (zebrafish and mice). In Specific Aim 3 we will evaluate the extent to which specific biochemical pathways modify BBS phenotypes.

"Atherosclerosis; Brain Disorders; Cardiovascular; Cerebrovascular; Genetics; Neurosciences; Stroke","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identifying novel endogenous ligands that promote thrombosis and inflammatory processes in pathological settings such as diabetes hypercholesterolemia and vascular hypertension may lead to new therapies that improve outcomes in patients at high risk for stroke. A variant of fibronectin (FN) containing the alternatively-spliced extra domain A (EDA+-FN) which is absent in the arteries or circulation of healthy humans and mice is specifically expressed in the endothelium of atherosclerotic arteries and elevated in circulation during pathological settings such as diabetes atherosclerosis and vascular hypertension most likely due to endothelial dysfunction. Recently we have discovered that EDA+-FN promotes thrombosis and inflammatory processes. The underlying mechanisms by which EDA+-FN contributes to thrombosis and inflammation are not well understood. EDA+-FN is known to activate the toll-like- receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. Additionally EDA is a ligand for integrin 91 which is expressed on inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors for acute stroke in humans. Therefore in hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/- atherosclerosis prone) mice we propose to test the central hypothesis that EDA+-FN contributes to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) brain injury in pathological setting and that itdoes so by enhancing thrombosis and inflammatory processes via parallel 91and TLR4-mediated pathways. In Aim1 we will define the role of TLR4 in EDA+-FN-mediated thrombosis and inflammatory I/R brain injury. In Aim 2 we will determine the role of integrin 91 in EDA+-FN -mediated thrombosis and inflammatory I/R brain injury. In Aim 3 we will define the role of plasma versus endothelial cell EDA+-FN in I/R brain injury. Furthermore we will determine the source of EDA+-FN in the plasma of the aforementioned pathological conditions. As a translational approach we will test the hypothesis that blocking EDA+-FN with specific monoclonal antibodies will reduce stroke injury in the context of hypercholesterolemia. To achieve our specific experimental goals we have developed novel genetically modified mice strains and reagents that we will share with other researchers in the field. The contribution of th proposed studies is highly clinically significant as it determine the mechanistic insights by whichEDA+-FN promotes thrombosis and inflammatory brain injury in disease context of atherosclerosis. The proposal has future translational potential as it may have significant impacton the diagnosis and treatment of common thrombo-inflammatory diseases including acute stroke.","Accounting;Acute;Alteplase;Alternative Splicing;Apolipoprotein E;Arteries;Atherosclerosis;Binding;Blood Circulation;Blood Platelets;Blood Vessels;Blood flow;Bone Marrow;Brain Injuries;Carotid Artery Thrombosis;Cell Adhesion Molecules;Cells;Cerebrum;Chimera organism;Clinical;Coagulation Process;Diabetes Mellitus;Diagnosis;Disease;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Exons;Experimental Animal Model;Fab Immunoglobulins;Fibrinolysis;Fibronectins;Functional disorder;Future;Genes;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Human;Hypertension;Infarction;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Injury;Integrins;Ischemia;Ischemic Penumbra;Ischemic Stroke;Knockout Mice;Lead;Life;Ligands;Liver;LoxP-flanked allele;Measures;Mediating;Modeling;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mouse Strains;Mus;Neurological outcome;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pilot Projects;Plasma;Platelet aggregation;Process;RNA Splicing;Reagent;Recruitment Activity;Reperfusion Injury;Reperfusion Therapy;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Source;TLR4 gene;Testing;Thrombosis;Thrombus;Time;Translating;United States;Variant;Vent;Work;acute stroke;clinically significant;common treatment;defined contribution;effective therapy;endothelial dysfunction;high risk;hypercholesterolemia;improved;improved outcome;in vivo;inflammatory marker;insight;intravital microscopy;knowledge of results;macrophage;mouse model;mouse toll-like receptor 4;mutant;neuron loss;neutrophil;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;overexpression;pre-clinical;restoration;stroke;tegrin;translational approach","Fibronectin alternative splicing in thrombosis and inflammation","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite advances in therapy during last 20 years stroke still continues to be 4th most common threat to life and health in the United States and worldwide and accounts for rising health costs.

"Digestive Diseases; Infectious Diseases; Orphan Drug; Rare Diseases; Vector-Borne Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1. The Neglected Tropical Diseases include ascariasis and lymphatic filariasis. These diseases are caused by parasitic nematodes that are grouped in Clade III because of their molecular similarities. Ascariasis is caused by the large intestinal roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. Worldwide it occurs in 1.4 billion people. Lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) threatens over a billion people in 83 countries; it is caused by filaria nematodes like Brugia malayi. Control of these nematode parasites (adults or larvae) relies on a limited number of anthelmintic drugs. There are concerns that mass chemotherapy will lead to the development of resistance. There is a significant and urgent need for research that will allow better use of existing drugs including combinations to preserve their value and to develop new drugs. 2. Recently several novel nematode selective cholinergic anthelmintics like tribendimidine and derquantel (now synergized with abamectin) have been introduced and increased the significance of cholinergic anthelmintics. Tribendimidine has potential for single-dose Mass Drug Administration. Derquantel has 'resistance busting' actions against worms that are resistant to other cholinergic anthelmintics. The pharmacology of nematode nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) is more complex than has been appreciated. The muscle nAChRs are divided into N- L- and B-subtypes in the Clade III nematode Ascaris suum. The pharmacology of Clade III muscle receptors (levamisole receptors) are modulated by receptor subunit composition. The therapeutic importance of subtypes and modulation demands further investigation in parasitic nematodes. We have three aims. 3. Our approach will use muscle contraction assays current-clamp voltage-clamp patch- clamp cloning & Xenopus oocyte expression and pharmacological agents to characterize actions of cholinergic anthelmintics and the subtypes of their receptors. Aim #1 will characterize the mode of action and subtype selectivity of tribendimidine in A. suum. It will test the hypothesis that tribendimidine is not selective for the L-subtype of nAChR but another type in A. suum and determine if its action as an open-channel blocker limits efficacy. Aim #2 will examine the effects of subunit arrangements and stoichiometry on pharmacology of Ascaris nAChRs. It will express four specific nicotinic receptor subunits from A. suum in different combinations to test the hypothesis that different subunit compositions reproduce the pharmacological diversity of native muscle receptors (levamisole receptors). Aim #3 will characterize nAChR responses and receptors in B. malayi to test the hypothesis that the subtypes are functionally similar to the Clade III nematode A. suum. 4. The proposal is innovative exploring unknown drug effects and effects of subunit arrangements on the pharmacological properties of Clade III nAChRs. We also extend to the Brugia malayi parasite preparation the methods that this group of investigators has developed. 5. The overall impact will be a powerful influence on: expansion & informed use of tribendimidine a potential single-dose MDA;  the expansion and informed use of the pharmacological diversity of nicotinic anthelmintic target sites in Clade III nematodes; use of a novel B. malayi preparation for studying ion-channel targets for future drug development;  development or informed use of combinations (e.g. derquantel with avermectins; or combinations of subtype selective cholinergic anthelmintics).","Adult;Affect;Agonist;Animals;Anthelmintics;Ascariasis;Ascaris;Ascaris lumbricoides;Ascaris suum;Biological Assay;Brugia;Brugia malayi;Caenorhabditis elegans;China;Cloning;Complex;Country;Development;Disease;Dose;Drosophila acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit;Drug Combinations;Drug Controls;Drug effect disorder;Elephantiasis;Figs - dietary;Filarial Elephantiases;Future;Health;Human;Intestines;Investigation;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Lactones;Larva;Lead;Levamisole;Methods;Molecular;Muscle;Muscle Contraction;Nematoda;Nicotinic Receptors;Outcome;Parasites;Parasitic Diseases;Parasitic nematode;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacology;Preparation;Prevention;Property;Refractory;Research;Research Personnel;Resistance;Resistance development;Site;Surgical Flaps;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Toxin;Vaccines;Variant;Xenopus oocyte;avermectin;channel blockers;chemotherapy;cholinergic;drug development;filaria;improved;innovation;levamisole resistance;neglected tropical diseases;novel;novel therapeutics;patch clamp;receptor;response;stoichiometry;synergism;transmission process;voltage clamp;voltage/patch clamp","Pharmacological Diversity of nAChRs in Clade III Nematodes: Levamisole receptors","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ascaris lumbricoides affects 1.4 billion people worldwide and Brugia malayi affects 120 million people worldwide.

We will study the pharmacological diversity of Clade III nAChRs muscle receptors involved in transmission in order to determine: 1) the subtype selectivity and channel block action of a new drug tribendimidine; 2) how pharmacological diversity of muscle receptors including effects of derquantel and macrocyclic lactones is modulated by subunit composition in the Xenopus oocyte expression system and; 3) the nAChR subtypes present in Brugia.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Human Genome; Mental Health; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the years since the completion of the human genome project our ability to read the genome has improved tremendously. Frustratingly our ability to interpret and comprehend what we can now easily read has lagged behind. Genetic variants that lie outside protein-coding regions are particularly challenging to interpret because the rules that govern their regulatory function are far less understood than the principles of protein- coding sequence. Addressing this challenge is particularly urgent because the drastic fall in whole genome sequencing costs will bring with it a wave of newly discovered non-coding and potentially causal variants. The recent completion of several genome-scale projects and the release of pilot data from new and ongoing projects have made it possible to begin building models whose goal is to predict the function of non-coding genetic variation. We propose the development of a brain-centric variant annotation framework that integrates temporal and spatial expression information from existing data sets regulatory relationships established by eQTL studies and chromatin state information uncovered by ENCODE and other studies with the aim of providing for any arbitrary input variant an estimate of the magnitude of the effect the systems or tissues most likely affected by the variant and the stage of development at which the variant is most likely to produce a phenotype. Models will be trained on variants from whole genome sequencing studies of diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals. Development of this framework will proceed in three stages: 1) the above lines of genomic evidence will be combined with other features as predictors of enrichment for variants identified in individuals with diagnosed neuropsychiatric conditions producing a score indicative of the variant's phenotype-shaping potential; 2) spatiotemporal gene expression matrices will be integrated to provide estimates of the tissues and time points most likely affected by variation at the non- coding query locus; 3) by combining the estimates produced in stages 1 and 2 we will create a single weighted context matrix that represents the individual's aggregate regulatory variant burden in space (i.e. brain tissue/region) and time. The framework will be demonstrated on previously unpublished variants in autism and bipolar disorder. The proposed framework would to our knowledge be the first non-coding variant annotation system that focuses on the effect on the brain and is able to guide the user as to when and where the effects of potentially functionalvariants are likely to emerge in an individual. A further novel aspect of the proposed system is that it will provide an integrated estimate of the overall burden context for an individual in spac and time. The proposed project will provide a valuable resource for scientists performing research in the genomics of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Perhaps more importantly the lessons learned in the course of this project will provide the foundation for developing tools that may one day make interpreting non-coding variation in the clinic a reality.","Accounting;Address;Affect;Alleles;Autistic Disorder;Binding;Bioinformatics;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Chromatin;Clinic;Clinical;Code;Computational algorithm;Computing Methodologies;Data;Data Set;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Foundations;Gene Cluster;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Genes;Genetic;Genome;Genomics;Goals;Health;Human Genome;Human Genome Project;Individual;Learning;Light;Measures;Medical;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Mutation;Neurologic;Open Reading Frames;Other Genetics;Phenotype;Play;Potassium Hydroxide;Probability;Proteins;Reading;Reporting;Research;Resources;Risk;Role;Scientist;Shapes;Specificity;Staging;Sum;System;Time;Tissues;Training;Untranslated RNA;Variant;Variation (Genetics);Weight;base;brain tissue;case control;cost;epigenomics;exome;experience;falls;gene product;genetic variant;genome sequencing;genome-wide;human genomics;improved;insight;loss of function;model building;neuropsychiatry;novel;promoter;psychogenetics;research study;spatiotemporal;tool;trait;transcription factor;whole genome","Estimating the impact of genetic variants on the brain in space and time","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Non-protein coding sequence accounts for about 97% of the human genome and genetic variants in these regions can contribute to diseases and other traits.

"Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Genetics","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The molecular mechanisms underlying uveitis (intraocular inflammation) are poorly understood a major barrier to progress in treating the disease or designing specific therapeutics. This proposal builds on our exciting discovery that Autosomal Dominant Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV; a type of uveitis) can be caused by mutations in the cysteine protease CAPN5 (calpain-5) one member of a family of proteins that uses proteolysis to control a spectrum of molecular events. Thus CAPN5 is the first nonsyndromic uveitis gene to be identified which now makes possible a highly innovative molecular-genetic approach to identifying the factors responsible for intraocular inflammation neovascularization and fibrosis. The long-term goals of our research are to identify new therapeutic targets for uveitis. Our objective in this proposal is to identify the structure-functin mechanism of calpain-5 mutations that activate molecular pathways leading to uveitis and probe inhibitor interactions. Our central hypothesis is that ADNIV mutations increase calpain-5 proteolytic activity and are amenable to structure guided inhibition that will eventually be used t prevent retinal inflammation. Our rationale is that intracellular calpain-5 activity is normally atightly controlled proteolytic switch for activating signaling molecules and when calpain-5 is hyperactive target signals are tripped pathogenically. Excess calpain activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of human diseases including cancer multiple sclerosis Alzheimer's disease diabetes and muscular dystrophy. Although little is known about CAPN5 our preliminary studies suggest ADNIV disease mutants increase CAPN5 enzymatic activity through structural changes and alter cellular transcription. Our specific aims are to testthe hypotheses that: (1) ADNIV mutants alter CAPN5 catalytic and proteolytic activity in vitro; (2)CAPN5 and ADNIV residues affect activity of other calpains; and (3) ADNIV mutations alter CAPN5 structure using circular dichroism spectroscopy small angle x-ray scattering SAXS and crystallization. We will use novel enzymatic methods and modeling to pursue studies that trace the molecular mechanism of CAPN5 mutations. Our work should have a significant positive impact on identifying new molecular mechanisms for therapeutic intervention of uveitis. At the completion of these experiments we expect to have in hand a CAPN5 catalytic activity assays that can ultimately be used for low and high-throughput drug screening. We also expect to resolve the structure of the protein which will expose differences between CAPN5 and its orthologs. Since the ADNIV phenocopies other eye diseases our studies promise to have a broad positive impact beyond ADNIV and uveitis patients where components of the CAPN5 pathway may be therapeutic targets.","Affect;Age;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Biological Assay;Blindness;Calcium;Calpain;Caspase;Catalytic Domain;Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy;Clinical;Crystallization;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Disease model;Event;Eye;Eye diseases;Family;Fibrosis;Fluorescence;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Hand;In Vitro;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inherited;Malignant Neoplasms;Methods;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Molecular Structure;Morbidity - disease rate;Multiple Sclerosis;Muscular Dystrophies;Mutation;Names;Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences;Orthologous Gene;Outcome Study;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptides;Phenocopy;Phenotype;Photoreceptors;Preclinical Drug Evaluation;Process;Protein Family;Proteins;Proteolysis;Research;Retinal;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Uveitis;Visual;Work;base;calpain inhibitor;design;disease-causing mutation;gene discovery;genetic approach;human disease;in vitro activity;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insight;kindred;member;mutant;neovascular;neovascularization;new therapeutic target;novel;photoreceptor degeneration;prevent;protein structure;public health relevance;research study;therapeutic target","Structure and Function of Calpain-5","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: ADNIV is an inherited eye disease caused by mutations in calpain-5 that cause uveitis.

"Emerging Infectious Diseases; Infectious Diseases","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Staphylococcus aureus is a medically important human pathogen that is found in the nasal passages of approximately 1/3 of the human population. The nose serves as a reservoir for spread of this pathogen and predisposes the host to potential infection. Despite the importance of S. aureus to human health molecular mechanisms and host factors influencing nasal colonization are not well understood. We have recently discovered an extracellular amyloid fiber produced by S. aureus during nasal colonization. This finding is extremely novel and exciting as S. aureus has never been shown to produce extracellular structures. We hypothesize that this extracellular fiber is important for S. aureus nasal colonization and persistence within the nose. Our preliminary results suggest that the fibers contribute to biofilm development and consist of multiple toxins which are folding intobeta sheet rich confirmations to self-assemble into amyloid fibers. The aims of this proposal will determine the composition formation degradation and role of S. aureus fibers during nasal colonization and biofilm development. At the conclusion of these studies we will have expanded our knowledge of S. aureus nasal colonization and characterized a novel extracellular structure produced by this important commensal and pathogen.","Amino Acid Sequence;Amyloid fibers;Animal Model;Cell Wall;Cells;Communicable Diseases;Data;Development;Electrons;Environment;Exposure to;Extracellular Structure;Fiber;Growth;Health;Human;Individual;Infection;Integration Host Factors;Knowledge;Laboratories;Life;Microbial Biofilms;Molecular;Nose;Peptide Hydrolases;Peptides;Phenols;Population;Regulation;Resistance;Risk Factors;Rodent Model;Role;Staphylococcus aureus;Toxin;Translating;United States;Vision;base;beta pleated sheet;cost;extracellular;mutant;novel;pathogen;prevent;surfactant","Characterization of an extracellular structure produced by Staphylococcus aureus","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization is a very common and a risk factor for developing severe infections.

"Autoimmune Disease; Digestive Diseases; Genetics; Inflammatory Bowel Disease; Nutrition; Prevention","The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract is home to an extremely complex bacterial community that playsessential roles for the host including conversion and breakdown of metabolites immune system developmentand protection against microbial pathogens. These communities are highly dynamic-their composition andmetabolic activity can be altered dramatically by changes in their mammalian host including diet antibioticsdisease and aging. Significantly changes in the GI microbiota (dysbiosis) are often associated with humaninflammatory diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis infectious diseases and colorectalcancer. These disorders affect millions of people and cost the US economy nearly $40 billion each year. Thesheer complexity of the GI microbial community greatly complicates its study and makes it difficult to assignbiological function(s) to specific bacterial genera much less species. Consequently there is a lack of sensitivebiomarkers for early detection and monitoring of GI diseases. To address these gaps in knowledge wepropose to employ a highly simplified mouse model whose GI tract is colonized with only eight bacterialspecies the altered Schaedler flora (ASF). Collectively the ASF facilitates normal physiological function andhealth of the mouse GI system. In contrast to most bacteria comprising a conventional microbiota each ASFmember can be cultured in vitro. We are one of the few research teams in the US experienced in using thishost-microbial community model to evaluate GI mucosal health and disease. Our central hypothesis is thatperturbations mediated by host genetics and microbial provocateurs drive metabolic adaptations thatare unique signatures of health and disease. We will use deep transcriptome sequencing along withquantitative PCR to profile changes in gene expression and abundance of the entire GI community to assessthe metabolic states of the individual species in response to disease states. The ASF model will allow us toidentify adaptations important for maintenance of the community through changes in the GI environment at alevel not possible with a conventional mouse models or by using mice colonized with a single bacterialspecies.

"Bioengineering; Biotechnology; Dental/Oral and Craniofacial Disease; Gene Therapy; Genetics; Regenerative Medicine","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chemical modification of bases in mRNA (cmRNA) has been shown recently to significantly enhance its cellular uptake and intra-cellular stability. This strategy was shown to be safe and efficient when used for reprogramming cells in targeted cancer therapy or for therapeutic in vivo delivery of target molecules to treat lethal lung diseaseor to prevent allergic asthma. This study is directed at harnessing this novel technology for regenerative applications. Specifically this study aims to develop a biomaterial based delivery system that releases cmRNA of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) in a controlled fashion to induce bone regeneration. The specific aims are: (1) to synthesize and characterize a biomaterial-based cmRNA (BMP-2) delivery system and (2) to determine the in vivo efficacy of a biomaterial-based cmRNA (BMP-2) delivery system to induce bone formation. For aim 1 polyethylenimine (PEI)-cmRNA (encoding BMP-2) nanoplexes will be synthesized using established methods and characterized for size surface charge and cmRNA condensation. The cytotoxicity and transfection efficiency of synthesized nanoplexes will be evaluated in human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and murine pre-osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1). Expression levels of bone specific genes (osteocalcin and type I collagen) core binding factor (Cbfa)-1 and Osterix in the transfected cells will be determined. The functionality of transfection will be examined by assessing mineral nodule formation and measuring alkaline phosphatase activity in transfected cells. For aim 2 the optimized preparations will be implanted in calvarial bone defects (CBD) in Fisher 344 rats. After four and eight weeks animals will be euthanized and new bone volume and bone area (%) at the implanted sites will be assessed using imaging and histologic techniques.","Aftercare;Alkaline Phosphatase;Animals;Area;Biocompatible;Biocompatible Materials;Biological Response Modifiers;Biomimetic Materials;Bone Development;Bone Marrow;Bone Regeneration;Bone Tissue;Calvaria;Cells;Charge;Chemicals;Clinical;Collagen;Collagen Type I;Control Groups;Core-Binding Factor;Defect;Dentistry;Development;Effectiveness;Extrinsic asthma;Fracture;Fracture Healing;Future;Gene Proteins;Genes;Goals;Health;Histological Techniques;Histology;Human;Imaging Techniques;Immune;Immunoprecipitation;Implant;In Vitro;Inbred BALB C Mice;Intramuscular;Intraperitoneal Injections;Knowledge;Left;Lung diseases;Measures;Medicine;Messenger RNA;Methods;Minerals;Modeling;Modification;Mus;Nodule;Non-Viral Vector;Osteocalcin;Osteogenesis;Physical condensation;Preparation;Proteins;RNA;RNA Stability;Rattus;Recombinant Proteins;Recombinants;Regenerative Medicine;Safety;Serum;Site;Staining method;Stains;Stromal Cells;Surface;Surface Properties;System;Testing;Therapeutic;Time;Tissue Engineering;Transfection;Translations;Viral Vector;Work;X-Ray Computed Tomography;base;bone;bone morphogenetic protein 2;chemical release;chemical synthesis;clinically significant;cost effective;cytotoxicity;dosage;gene therapy;immunogenicity;implantation;in vitro Model;in vivo;innovation;nanoparticle;new technology;novel;novel strategies;osteoblast differentiation;prevent;primary outcome;recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2;regenerative;scaffold;targeted cancer therapy;targeted delivery;uptake","A Novel RNA Based Biomaterial for Bone Regeneration","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In medicine and dentistry there is an enormous need for cost-effective biomaterials that possess clinically significant bone regenerative capacity and predictability.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this training program is to continue to produce physician-scientists who will advance understanding of human health and disease and enhance delivery of effective clinical care. The Iowa Medical Student Research Program achieves this goal through fostering innovation professional scientific interactions mentorship training in research ethics and communication and development of a critical approach to one's own and peers' scientific work. The University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine (CCOM) has a long history supporting medical student research with a successful and growing research- training program that began over 40 years ago. The NIH has continuously funded the program since 1980. Under the auspices of the training grant students are given the opportunity to be involved in a research project of their choosing for 12 weeks in the summer preceding or following the first year of medical school. Students choose a mentor from any of 20 clinical and 6 basic science departments in the Carver College of Medicine or the Colleges of Public Health Pharmacy or Liberal Arts and Sciences. Over 150 faculty mentors with ideas for short-term projects are listed on a searchable online database from which students may sort options by department type of research or by keyword. Students are required to submit a proposal which is competitively reviewed by the Research Committee of the CCOM. Student applications are rank- ordered by the score received and those with the best scores are chosen for the 32 NIH training stipends with another 50 stipends funded by the CCOM individual departments and other sources. The program exposes the students to the entire research process from writing a research proposal to working with their mentor to submit their research accomplishments in the form of an abstract and presentation of their research at the annual Medical Student Research Day. This experience permits students to acquire skills such as application of scientific methods critical evaluation of previous related experimental work and statistical approaches to data analysis. At the same time they acquire knowledge and develop skills related to a specific research project while working closely with a faculty role model and mentor. The program has led to a substantial number of student presentations at national meetings and numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals. There has been steady interest in continuing involvement in research throughout medical school on the Research Distinction Track an honors program for CCOM students with a sustained commitment to research. Graduates repeatedly cite the summer research fellowship experience as the basis for their choice of specialty or decision to conduct basic clinical or translational research as faculty in academic medical centers. The long-term impact of this program is the nationwide dissemination of a cadre of physicians who developed an appreciation for team-based science early in their career equipping them to make evidence-based decisions and advance healthcare quality.","Academic Medical Centers;Arts;Basic Science;Clinical;Clinical Research;Communication;Data Analyses;Databases;Development;Disease;Evaluation;Faculty;Fellowship;Fostering;Funding;Goals;Grant;Health;Health Occupations;Human;Individual;Iowa;Journals;Knowledge;Medical Students;Medicine;Mentors;Mentorship;Methods;Peer Review;Pharmacy facility;Physicians;Process;Public Health;Publications;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Ethics;Research Project Grants;Research Proposals;Research Training;Science;Scientist;Sorting - Cell Movement;Source;Students;Time;Training;Training Programs;Translational Research;United States National Institutes of Health;Universities;Work;Writing;abstracting;base;career;clinical care;college;evidence base;experience;faculty mentor;health care quality;innovation;interest;medical schools;medical specialties;meetings;peer;programs;role model;skills;student training;summer research","Short-term Training for Students in the Health Professions","8.

"Aging; Bioengineering; Clinical Research; Eye Disease and Disorders of Vision; Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase-II proposal seeks to elucidate the structure-function relationships between visual field threshold sensitivity and the structural features of the retinal layers the optic nerve head and the connecting nerve fiber bundles in glaucoma. This proposal extends our successful Phase-I research that established structure- structure relationships among retinal quantitative indices. In this Phase II further advancements of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD OCT) image analysis will yield new damage metrics expected to correspond much better with visual field threshold sensitivity. The project is driven by an important clinical problem - the poor reliability and reproducibility of th visual field as a measure of irreversible damage to the retinal ganglion cells and their axons in glaucoma. Our long-term vision remains to determine/predict glaucoma visual function from objective structure measurements by OCT. Once achieved this new approach will provide an objective and reproducible measure complementing subjective functional assessment of glaucoma damage decrease the need for frequent visual field testing resulting from long-term fluctuation of visual response and improve glaucoma treatment based on reliable progression markers. Specifically we will develop predictive models of increasing complexity yielding a patient- specific predictive model of glaucomatous damage. The overriding hypothesis motivating the proposed research is that novel quantitative metrics of the entire retinal ganglion cell-axonal complex morphology utilizing the nerve fiber bundle trajectories allow reliable prediction of visual function. We have identified the following specific aims: Aim 1: Establish a baseline for the focal structural-functional correlation in the retina covered by the Humphrey 24-2 perimetry test (24 degree radius visual field) by comparing 24-2 thresholds with their corresponding structural indices derived from registered multi-field SD-OCT scans in glaucoma and normal subjects. Derive a baseline predictive model of function from structural properties of the inner retinal layers comprised of retinal ganglion cell and nerve fiber layers. Aim 2: Demonstrate that incorporating structural parameters along SD-OCT atlas-based retinal ganglion cell- axonal complex (RGC-AC) trajectories improves the performance of the predictive structure-function model. Aim 3: Evaluate whether prediction of 24-2 thresholds is improved by deriving individual-based RGC-AC trajectories instead of from an RGC-AC atlas. The proposed work will be performed using 7-field per eye 3D SD-OCT images accompanied by 24-2 visual field test data on the same day from 100 patients with glaucoma and 40 age-matched normal subjects.","3-Dimensional;Address;Adherence;Age;Age Distribution;Anatomy;Applications Grants;Atlases;Automobile Driving;Axon;Biometry;Burn injury;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Collaborations;Complement;Complex;Data;Data Analyses;Diagnosis;Enrollment;Environment;Eye;Frequencies;Funding;Glaucoma;Goals;Health;Image;Image Analysis;Individual;Maps;Measurement;Measures;Medical Imaging;Modeling;Monitor;Morphology;Nerve Fibers;Ophthalmology;Optic Disk;Optical Coherence Tomography;Patient Care;Patients;Performance;Perimetry;Phase;Productivity;Property;Protocols documentation;Qualifying;Radial;Reproducibility;Research;Research Personnel;Retina;Retinal;Retinal Diseases;Retinal Ganglion Cells;Scanning;Specialist;Staging;Structure;Structure-Activity Relationship;Study Subject;Test Result;Testing;Thick;Tissues;Vision;Visual;Visual Fields;Work;authority;base;design;disease diagnosis;experience;field study;ganglion cell;imaging Segmentation;improved;indexing;novel;novel strategies;patient oriented research;predictive modeling;progression marker;response;three dimensional structure","Three-dimensional structure-function relationships in glaucoma from SD-OCT","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Three dimensional spectral OCT imaging provides a wealth of information about the morphology and tissue characteristics of retinal layers.

"Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Genetics; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Voltage-gated Cav channels mediate activity-dependent Ca2+ signals required for gene transcription and neurotransmission. Ca2+-dependent inactivation and facilitation (CDI and CDF respectively) allow Cav channels to adjust Ca2+ influx according to neuronal activity thereby fine-tuning Ca2+ signals that control neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. The rationale for the proposed research is that defining how Cav channels generate and maintain Ca2+ signals will answer longstanding questions regarding the heterogeneous properties of Cav channels in neurons and enable new mechanistic inquiries into the roles of specific Cav channels in orchestrating the normal development and function of the nervous system. The expected outcomes of the proposed research are: establishment of a new role for calretinin as a dynamic regulator of effectors including Cav2.1 (Aim 1); and elucidation of a mechanism responsible for the ""long-lasting"" properties and functional impact of neuronal Cav1 L-type currents (Aim 2). We believe that the proposed research will make a lasting and positive impact: the Cav channel regulatory mechanisms it will define will likely facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders resulting from dysregulation of neuronal Ca2+ signals.","Animal Model;Ataxia;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder;Autistic Disorder;Basic Science;Behavior;Behavioral;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Bipolar Disorder;Brain;Brain Diseases;Buffers;Calcium Channel;Calmodulin;Cardiac;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cells;Cytoplasmic Granules;Development;Disease;Drosophila genus;Electrophysiology (science);Epilepsy;Exhibits;Feedback;Fright;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Polymorphism;Genetic Transcription;Health;Ions;Knowledge;Learning;Macromolecular Complexes;Major Depressive Disorder;Mediating;Migraine;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Nervous System Physiology;Neuromuscular Junction;Neurons;Outcome;P-Q type voltage-dependent calcium channel;Pathogenesis;Pharmacologic Substance;Physiological;Process;Property;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Research;Risk Factors;Role;Schizophrenia;Signal Transduction;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic plasticity;System;Testing;Therapeutic;United States National Institutes of Health;Work;anxiety-like behavior;base;caldendrin;calretinin;cell type;computer studies;effective therapy;genetic manipulation;in vivo;information processing;insight;loss of function;motor control;nervous system disorder;neuronal excitability;neurophysiology;neuropsychiatric disorder;neurotransmission;novel;novel therapeutics;programs;research study;sensor;voltage","Regulation of Neuronal Calcium Channels","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will characterize the mechanisms and physiological significance of factors that modulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels neurons.

"Brain Disorders; Cannabinoid Research; Clinical Research; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Schizophrenia; Serious Mental Illness; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this research is to determine the effects of marijuana (MJ) on brain connectivity in adolescents and to establish whether such influences on complex neural networks are more pronounced in biological relatives of schizophrenia (SZ) patients. This proposal is significant because it will provide new information about the potential hazards adolescent MJ exposure poses to public health. Adolescent MJ use is a known environmental risk factor for SZ. MJ is also the most commonly used illicit drug among adolescents in the U.S. where first MJ exposure often occurs in mid-adolescence. Recent youth surveys report rising MJ usage persistent easy MJ access and declining perception that MJ is harmful. Activation of cannabinoid receptors is vital in regulating neural cell survival brain development and neuroplasticity. Animal studies provide clear evidence that tetrahydrocannabinol present in MJ is deleterious to the brain especially during the sensitive period of adolescent brain maturation. However human neuroimaging studies have been contradictory partly due to the absence of longitudinal data on human adolescents. To address these gaps in knowledge we will conduct a prospective MRI study of healthy adolescent volunteers without family history of SZ (HNV) and a matched sample of first-degree relatives of SZ patients. At study entry subjects have no prior MJ use. Targeted recruitment strategies and close attention to promote subject retention will be utilized. Brain anatomic diffusion-weighted magnetization transfer ratio and resting-state functional MRI data are obtained at intake and 3 years later. Using reliable and well-validated assessment protocols at 6-monthly intervals subjects will be monitored for onset and severity of emergent MJ use (expected to be 25% of intake sample). This prospective study design will yield 4 informative comparison groups (stratified by MJ use and SZ family history) providing an explicit test to reveal the unique effect of adolescent MJ exposure and of familial SZ risk on longitudinal brain changes. Specific Aims 1 and 2 utilize state-of-the-art statistical analyses to assess the impact of emergent MJ use on within-subject changes in brain structural integrity and on differential effects in SZ relatives. he hypothesis is that adolescents with emergent MJ use will show deficits in structural brain integrity. Against a background of genetic vulnerability for SZ biological relatives will be more susceptible to MJ's deleterious effects. Specific Aim 3 uses novel graph theory methods to quantify the topographical properties of brain structural and functional connectivity. The influence of adolescent MJ use on changes in brain network organization will be contrasted between HNV and SZ relatives. Specific Aim 4 explores secondary outcomes of neurocognition personality traits and prodromal symptoms to develop integrative models to explain the adolescent MJ-SZ link. Thus this proposal with its longitudinal study design and innovative network connectivity measures will advance knowledge regarding the impact adolescent MJ exposure has on public health and on SZ susceptibility.","Address;Adolescence;Adolescent;Adolescent marijuana use;Affect;Anatomy;Animals;Anisotropy;Apoptotic;Attention;Biological;Biological Neural Networks;Brain;Cannabinoids;Cell Survival;Cerebellum;Characteristics;Chronic;Complex;Conflict (Psychology);Data;Data Analyses;Development;Environmental Risk Factor;Family;Family history of;First Degree Relative;Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Genetic;Genetic Predisposition to Disease;Goals;Graph;Health;High School Student;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;Impulsivity;Individual;Intake;Knowledge;Lead;Length;Link;Longitudinal Studies;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Marijuana;Measures;Mediating;Methods;Modeling;Monitor;Neurocognition;Neurocognitive;Neurodevelopmental Disorder;Neuronal Plasticity;Neurons;Patients;Perception;Personality Traits;Predisposition;Property;Prospective Studies;Protocols documentation;Public Health;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Reporting;Research;Research Design;Rest;Risk;Sampling;Sampling Studies;Schizophrenia;Series;Severities;Statistical Methods;Structure;Surveys;Symptoms;System;Testing;Tetrahydrocannabinol;Weight;Work;Youth;aged;base;behavior measurement;brain volume;cannabinoid receptor;comparison group;diffusion weighted;disability;effective therapy;exogenous cannabinoid;follow-up;graph theory;hazard;healthy volunteer;illicit drug use;in vivo;innovation;marijuana use;neuroimaging;neuron apoptosis;neuropsychiatric disorder;neurotransmission;novel;prospective;relating to nervous system;secondary outcome;volunteer;white matter;young adult","Adolescent Cannabis Use Complex Brain Network Connectivity & Schizophrenia Risk","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Marijuana is a major public health problem worldwide.

"Alcoholism, Alcohol Use and Health; Brain Disorders; Conditions Affecting the Embryonic and Fetal Periods; Fetal Alcohol Syndrome; Genetics; Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD); Neurodegenerative; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Perinatal Period - Conditions Originating in Perinatal Period; Prevention; Substance Abuse","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fetal exposure to alcohol can severely and permanently damage the developing brain and can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Despite public information campaigns and warnings from the Surgeon General many women continue to abuse alcohol during pregnancy and FASD remains one of the most common causes of mental retardation. In the US alone FASD cases are estimated to cost the economy $5.4 billion annually. One of the most important ways in which alcohol disrupts brain development is by killing neurons. Loss of neurons contributes strongly to the microencephaly behavior problems and learning deficits in children with FASD. Utilizing pharmacological molecular and genetic approaches we have discovered that a particular signaling pathway mediated by nitric oxide (NO) can protect developing neurons against alcohol toxicity. Using in vitro systems we have found that pharmacological activation of the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway can prevent alcohol-induced neuronal death. Conversely blockade of this pathway worsens neuronal losses. Over-expression of the gene encoding neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) which produces NO within neurons protects neurons against alcohol-induced death. The objective of this proposal is to advance our findings beyond the in vitro setting to determine whether the pathway can similarly protect the developing brain in vivo against alcohol toxicity and can be used as a therapeutic intervention. The first aim examines the possibility that overexpression of the nNOS gene can ameliorate alcohol- induced neuronal death and behavioral deficits. Studies in this aim will examine whether ectopically expressed nNOS in Purkinje cells the most vulnerable neuronal population to alcohol toxicity can protect those cells against alcohol-induced cell death and prevent alcohol-induced cerebellar dysfunction. The second aim examines the mechanism by which the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway signals its neuroprotective effects. Studies in this aim will determine whether the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway protects developing neurons against alcohol-induced death by inhibiting oxidative stress. The third specific aim examines whether the phosphodiesterase 2 inhibitor Bay60-7550 can protect the developing brain against alcohol toxicity by activating the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway thus inhibiting oxidative stress. Completion of this research may shed light on the role of alcohol-induced oxidative stress in FASD and may identify the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway as a promising target for preventive interventions against FASD.","Affect;Alcohols;Behavioral;Biochemical;Biological Models;Biology;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Brain;Cell Death;Cells;Cerebellar Diseases;Cessation of life;Child;Clinical;Communities;Cyclic GMP;Data;Development;Ethanol toxicity;Fetal Alcohol Exposure;Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder;Fetus;Gene Deletion;Gene Delivery;Generations;Genes;Goals;Growth;In Vitro;Killings;Knockout Mice;Laboratories;Lead;Learning;Light;Maintenance;Mediating;Mental Retardation;Microcephaly;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Mus;Neuraxis;Neurons;Nitric Oxide;Nitric Oxide Donors;Nitric Oxide Pathway;Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Perinatal Exposure;Pharmacology;Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors;Play;Population;Preventive Intervention;Problem behavior;Public Health;Purkinje Cells;Qualifying;Reactive Oxygen Species;Research;Research Personnel;Role;Signal Pathway;Staging;Structure;Surgeon;System;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transgenic Mice;Transgenic Organisms;Woman;alcohol exposure;alcohol sensitivity;cell type;cost;critical period;genetic approach;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;injured;neuron loss;neuroprotection;neurotoxicology;overexpression;phosphoric diester hydrolase;prevent;protective effect;public health relevance;small molecule","NO-mediated neuroprotection against alcohol: mechanism and potential therapy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: NO-mediated neuroprotection against alcohol: mechanism and potential therapy Alcohol abuse during pregnancy can profoundly affect the fetus and cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) which is a leading cause of mental retardation and a major public health problem.

Cav1.3 channels exhibit distinct properties in IHCs compared to other cell-types but little is known about what underlies these differences or their relevance for sound encoding by the IHCs. Filling this gap in knowledge is expected to reveal fundamental processes that are required for the unique role of Cav1.3 channels at this first synapse in the auditory pathway. The long-term goal of our research is to define the mechanisms that regulate voltage- gated Cav Ca2+ channels in order to discover what causes and how to cure human disease. To this end we have identified new forms of Cav1.3 modulation in IHCs. First we found that the cell-surface density of Cav1.3 channels in IHCs is controlled by interactions with harmonin a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Usher syndrome. Harmonin enhances degradation of Cav1.3 by the ubiquitin-proteosome (UPS) system and this process is disrupted in a mouse model of Usher syndrome. Second we discovered that CaBP2 a Ca2+ binding related to calmodulin (CaM) inhibits Ca2+-dependent inactivation of Cav1.3; this effect is impaired by a human mutation in the CaBP2 gene that causes autosomal-recessive hearing loss. Third we found that Cav1.3 associates with RIBEYE the major component of ""ribbon"" synapses in IHCs and other sensory cell-types. This interaction may regulate not only the localization but also the function of Cav1.3 at the IHCactive zone. Based on our findings we hypothesize that the macromolecular assembly of Cav1.3 with proteins such as harmonin CaBP2 and RIBEYE dictate the strength and localization of Ca2+ signals in IHCs and is therefore crucial for auditory transmission. The objective of this proposal is to test this hypothesis using molecular genetic and electrophysiological techniques. The rationale is that the proposed research will reveal essential signaling complexes that shape the synaptic function of IHCs and how dysregulation of such complexes may contribute to the pathophysiology of inherited or acquired forms of hearing loss.","Acoustic Nerve;Adverse effects;Animal Model;Auditory;Binding;Binding Proteins;Biochemical;Brain;Brain Stem;Calcium Channel;Calmodulin;Cardiovascular system;Cell surface;Cells;Complex;Deafness;Electrophysiology (science);Exhibits;Exocytosis;Family member;Functional disorder;Genes;Goals;Hair Cells;Health;Hearing problem;Heart;Human;Image;In Vitro;Inherited;Inner Hair Cells;Knowledge;Mediating;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Mus;Mutation;Neurologic;Neurotransmitters;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Physiological;Process;Property;Protein Family;Proteins;Regulation;Research;Role;Scaffolding Protein;Sensory;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Synapses;System;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Ubiquitin;Usher Syndrome;auditory pathway;base;caldendrin;cell type;density;hearing impairment;human disease;innovation;loss of function;macromolecular assembly;mouse model;multicatalytic endopeptidase complex;ribbon synapse;sound;spiral ganglion;synaptic function;therapeutic development;transmission process;voltage","Regulation of auditory calcium channels","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will characterize the mechanisms and physiological significance of factors that modulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in auditory hair cells.

"Cancer; Radiation Oncology; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of modern cancer therapies is predicated on the idea that anticancer agents should selectively kill cancer vs. normal cells by exploiting biochemical and physiological differences specific to cancer cells. The notion that early progenitor ""cancer stem cells"" (CSCs) may represent a subpopulation of cancer cells contributing to treatment failure has also gained significant experimental support. Furthermore fundamental differences in oxidative metabolism between cancer and normal cells appear to lead to increased steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS; O2- and H2O2) and may represent a ""target"" for selectively enhancing therapeutic responses. If survival of CSCs could be compromised by selectively enhancing the production of ROS while inhibiting hydroperoxide metabolism then differences in CSC metabolism could be exploited to selectively improve responses to conventional radio-chemo-therapies. Preliminary data shows that early progenitor CSCs from human breast carcinoma population exhibit increased steady-state levels of O2-- relative to stem cells derived from normal breast epithelial cell populations. In addition pharmacological manipulations of ROS levels [with mitochondrial targeted triphenylphosphonium derivatives; TPP] and/or inhibition of glutathione (GSH)- and thioredoxin (Trx)- dependent hydroperoxide metabolism [using buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) and Auranofin (AUR)] is shown to selectively deplete CSCs relative to normal stem cells by inducing metabolic oxidative stress. Finally TPP derivatives are well tolerated in animals and simultaneous inhibition of GSH- and Trx-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism (AUR+BSO) enhances CSCs responses to radiation. These preliminary data led to the hypothesis that pharmacological manipulations designed to increase mitochondrial ROS production (with TPP derivatives) combined with inhibitors of GSH- and Trx- dependent hydroperoxide metabolism will cause selective cytotoxicity in CSCs (vs. normal stem cells) as well as enhance tumor responses to radio-chemo-therapies by increasing O2-- and H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims to: 1) Determine if pharmacological manipulations with TPP derivatives will selectively enhance oxidative stress as well as chemo-radio-sensitivity by increasing mitochondrial O2-- and H2O2 in cancer vs. normal stem cells in vitro and in vivo and 2) Determine if simultaneous inhibition of GSH- and Trx-dependent hydroperoxide metabolism combined with TPP derivatives can selectively sensitize cancer vs. normal stem cells to chemo- or radio-sensitivity by increasing O2- and H2O2-mediated oxidative stress. Completing these studies will provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of the potential for using manipulations of mitochondrial ROS in combination with inhibitors of hydroperoxide metabolism to selectively kill cancer stem cells. This work addresses a critical question in cancer biology necessary for exploiting altered stem cell oxidative metabolism to enhance cancer therapy.","Address;Animals;Antineoplastic Agents;Auranofin;Biochemical;Breast Carcinoma;Breast Epithelial Cells;Buthionine Sulfoximine;Cancer Biology;Cancer stem cell;Cell Respiration;Cell Survival;Cellular Metabolic Process;Chronic;Clinical Trials;Data;Development;Electron Transport;Electrons;Exhibits;Figs - dietary;Genomic Instability;Glucose;Glutathione;Growth;Health;Human;Hydrogen Peroxide;In Vitro;Killings;Lead;Malignant Neoplasms;Mediating;Metabolic;Metabolic stress;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Normal Cell;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Population;Production;Radiation Tolerance;Reaction;Reactive Oxygen Species;Regulation;Resistance;Signal Transduction;Stem cells;Superoxides;TXN gene;Testing;Therapeutic;Translating;Treatment Failure;Undifferentiated;Warburg Effect;Work;base;cancer cell;cancer therapy;chemoradiation;cytotoxicity;design;glucose metabolism;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;progenitor;radiation response;response;therapy resistant;treatment response;tumor","Enhancing Metabolic Oxidative Stress and Therapy Responses in Cancer Stem Cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of modern cancer therapies is predicated on the idea that anticancer agents should selectively kill cancer vs. normal cells by exploiting biochemical and physiological differences specific to cancer cells.

"Biotechnology; Genetics; Hematology; Stem Cell Research; Stem Cell Research - Nonembryonic - Non-Human","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): B cells represent a critical component of the immune system: in the absence of these cells the ability to fight infections and to establish long-term protective immunity are severely impaired. B cell development and function depend on elaborate mechanisms that tightly control gene expression and the physiologic breakage and repair of DNA that occurs uniquely in lymphoid progenitors. Although these mechanisms function with remarkable fidelity they can be perturbed by discrete genetic lesions leading to immune dysfunction or lymphocytic cancers in humans. Thus dissecting the molecular pathways that control B cell development is critical to advancing our understanding of normal immune system physiology and diseases that arise from the B cell compartment.  The overarching objective of our proposal is to gain new insight into the mechanisms that globally control gene expression during B cell development. It has been established that a regulatory network anchored by several DNA-binding proteins is primarily responsible for controlling gene transcription during B cell development. This network enforces widespread gene repression as well as activation thus imparting a B- lineage identity onto developing progenitors. Yet the factors that function downstream of B-lineage DNA- binding proteins to globally orchestrate gene repression and activation have only begun to be identified. In our previous studies we identified a novel mutant mouse strain named Justy (for just T cells) which carries a recessive mutation that abolishes B cell development but does not impair other major aspects of mouse physiology. The causative lesion is a point mutation that dramatically reduces but does not abolish expression of a protein called Gon4-like which contains homology to factors that mediate epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Gene expression profiling indicated that decreased Gon4-like expression does not impair activation of B-lineage genes but does prevent the repression of genes encoding proteins that can antagonize B cell development. Among these are genes encoding factors that have lineage-instructive roles in hematopoietic developmental pathways. Based on these data we hypothesize that Gon4-like is a critical component of the regulatory network that establishes a B-lineage gene program identity while extinguishing alternative lineage programs particularly those associated with myeloid cell development. We propose to employ mouse genetic tools cell culture systems retroviral gene transfer technology and methods for quantifying gene expression to carry out studies that will integrate Gon4-like into the regulatory circuitry the controls B cell development. To complement these studies we will use molecular and biochemical approaches to identify co-factors for Gon4-like and to begin defining the role of Gon4-like in gene regulation on a genome-wide scale. Completion of these studies will break new ground in our understanding of the mechanisms that control hematopoietic lineage fate decisions and imprint commitment to a B cell fate. Such knowledge will provide novel insights regarding the relationships between impairment of B cell development and the appearance of immunodeficiencies or B cell progenitor-derived lymphoid cancers.","Affect;Antibodies;Appearance;B-Cell Development;B-Lymphocytes;Biochemical;Blood;Bone Marrow;CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins;Cancer Biology;Cell Culture System;Cell Differentiation process;Cell Lineage;Cell physiology;Cells;Complement;Complex;DNA Repair;DNA-Binding Proteins;Data;Development;Disease;Event;Gene Activation;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Gene Expression Regulation;Gene Targeting;Gene Transfer;Generations;Genes;Genetic;Genetic Recombination;Genetic Transcription;Hematopoietic;Human;Immune System Diseases;Immune system;Immunity;Immunoglobulin Gene Rearrangement;Immunoglobulin Genes;Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes;Impairment;Infection;Knowledge;Lead;Lesion;Libraries;Life;Link;Lymphocyte;Lymphoid;Lymphopoiesis;Malignant Neoplasms;Mature B-Lymphocyte;Mediating;Methods;Molecular;Multipotent Stem Cells;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Mutation;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Names;Neoplasms;Pathway interactions;Physiological;Physiology;Point Mutation;Process;Proteins;Research;Role;Series;Signal Transduction;Source;Staging;Stem cells;Supporting Cell;T-Lymphocyte;TCF3 gene;Technology;Testing;Transplantation;Work;base;cell growth;cell type;epigenetic regulation;fighting;gene repression;genome-wide;imprint;insight;leukemia;mouse development;novel;prevent;progenitor;programs;protein function;research study;response;tool;transcription factor","Role of the developmental regulator Gon4-like in B lymphopoiesis","B cells are generated throughout life and are the source of antibodies needed to fight infections.

"Cardiovascular; Genetics; Heart Disease; Nutrition; Obesity","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity has become a major epidemic in today's society. It is a major risk factor for cardiac disease and necessitates studies that enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in transcriptional adaptation to obesity that could potentially translate into therapeutic targets. A contributing factor in obesity is hypothyroidism. Many of the confounding cardiac effects of obesity overlap with effects of hypothyroidism including mitochondrial dysfunction disrupted cardiac energetics and ultimately decreased cardiac contractility. The heart requires highly efficient metabolism to maintain the levels of ATP needed for contractility and pump function. We identified a signaling pathway for transcriptional regulation in the heart by MED13 and found that this pathway plays a key role in modulating energy homeostasis. Our preliminary studies for this proposal show that altering cardiac transcription by MED13 significantly alters metabolic gene expression metabolite production and cardiac function prompting us to develop the necessary tools to identify the mechanism for MED13 function in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this application is to decipher the physiological role of MED13-dependent transcriptional regulation of cardiac reprograming in response to obesity and altered thyroid hormone levels. We hypothesize that MED13 functions to inhibit cardiac transcriptional reprogramming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The specific Aims designed to test this hypothesis using MED13 gain- and loss-of-function mice are: Aim 1: To analyze the molecular mechanistic action for MED13 regulation of cardiac energetics in response to obesity. The experiments planned will test the hypothesis that MED13 integrates metabolic signaling events in the heart functioning as a brake to regulate transcriptional reprogramming. We will utilize in vivo and in vitro models of obesity to assess changes in cardiac gene expression mitochondrial function metabolomics profile and key signaling pathways that are regulated by MED13. Aim 2: To define MED13- dependent regulation of cardiac remodeling in response to chronic hypothyroidism. The proposed experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that MED13 suppresses transcriptional reprograming in response to chronic hypothyroidism. We will utilize a similar experimental approach as in Aim 1 to dissect MED13-dependent cardiac effects of TH signaling in vitro and in vivo. These studies will provide mechanistic insights into the regulatory network linking cardiac reprograming in obesity and hypothyroidism. The new insights will provide opportunities for therapeutic modulation of cardiac diseases with disrupted transcriptional programing altered cardiac energetics and decreased function. .","Agonist;Biogenesis;Cardiac;Chronic;Clinical;Complex;Cues;Data;Defect;Diet;Disease;Energy Metabolism;Epidemic;Event;Exhibits;Foundations;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profile;Gene Expression Profiling;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Goals;Health;Heart;Heart Diseases;High Fat Diet;Homeostasis;Hypothyroidism;In Vitro;Invertebrates;Link;Mammals;Mediator of activation protein;Metabolic;Metabolism;Mitochondria;Molecular;Mus;Myocardial dysfunction;Nodal;Nuclear Receptors;Obesity;Outcome;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Pharmacological Treatment;Phosphotransferases;Physiological;Play;Predisposition;Production;Publishing;Pump;RNA Polymerase II;Regulation;Research;Resistance;Respiratory physiology;Risk Factors;Role;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Societies;Solid;Stress;Testing;Therapeutic;Thyroid Hormone Receptor;Thyroid Hormones;Transcriptional Regulation;Translating;base;cofactor;design;health economics;heart function;heart metabolism;in vitro Model;in vivo;insight;loss of function;member;metabolomics;mitochondrial dysfunction;new therapeutic target;obesogenic;overexpression;programs;research study;response;therapeutic target;tool","MED13 regulation of cardiac transcription in obesity and hypothyroidism","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity hypothyroidism and heart disease are major health concerns in today's society with significant health and economic consequences.

"Behavioral and Social Science; Brain Disorders; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Depression; Major Depressive Disorder; Mental Health; Mental Illness; Prevention; Serious Mental Illness","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Postpartum major depression (PPMD) is common occurring in approximately 7% of women in the first three months after childbirth. PPMD can have a profound impact for the woman decreasing quality of life increasing emotional distress and reducing caregiving capacity and can increase the risk of disturbances in infant development. A growing number of studies have shown that psychological treatments are effective at reducing the incidence of PPMD. In addition women overwhelmingly prefer psychological treatment to medication while pregnant or breast feeding. However numerous barriers exist that prevent women from accessing face-to-face services.  The Internet offers great potential in extending preventive services to women in the perinatal period. While such interventions have not been investigated in this population two broad classes of internet interventions have been evaluated. Individual Internet Interventions (IIIs) which provide patientswith access to web-based self-management skills training programs have been shown to be effective in reducing depression in general populations particularly when accompanied by some human support via email or telephone coaching. Internet Support Groups (ISGs) appear to be commonly used by women in the perinatal period. However randomized controlled trials have found them ineffective at reducing depression. Theories on the use of accountability to improve adherence and the application of online collaborative learning to enhance skill acquisition suggest that a careful integration of III and ISG could have a synergistic effect in improving bothadherence and outcomes in online treatments to prevent depression. Thus use of networked peers to enhance adherence and outcomes instead of therapists or coaches would make this intervention highly scalable.  We have designed constructed and piloted a prototype of an online intervention which we call ""Share"" that functionally integrates an III and an ISG targetingskills to manage mood and prevent depression. Shared goal setting and supportive monitoring by networked peers is designed to increase adherence to the program. Shared learning tools are designed to enhance learning through group learning processes. Based on promising results in a pilot we are proposing an RCT to evaluate Share. Women in weeks 20-28 of their pregnancy will be randomized to receive either Share or an III that will serve as a minimal treatment control. Share has the potential to provide a novel paradigm for the prevention of depression one that is accessible highly scalable and cost-effective.","Accountability;Accounting;Adherence;Aftercare;Behavior Therapy;Breast Feeding;Child Rearing;Childbirth;Clinical Research;Clinical Trials;Clinical assessments;Control Groups;Cost Analysis;Development;Distress;Educational process of instructing;Electronic Mail;Ethnic Origin;Funding;General Population;Goals;Health;Human;Impairment;Incidence;Individual;Infant Care;Infant Development;Internet;Intervention;Iowa;Lead;Learning;Life;Major Depressive Disorder;Manuscripts;Medicine;Mental Depression;Mental Health Services;Meta-Analysis;Modeling;Monitor;Moods;Online Systems;Outcome;Participant;Patients;Perinatal;Personal Satisfaction;Persons;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Postpartum Depression;Postpartum Period;Postpartum Women;Pregnancy;Preventive Intervention;Preventive service;Process;Protocols documentation;Publications;Quality of life;Race;Randomized;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recruitment Activity;Research;Risk;Rural;Sample Size;Sampling;Self Management;Services;Site;Stress;Support Groups;Technology;Teleconferences;Telemedicine;Telephone;Testing;Time;Training Programs;Training and Infrastructure;Universities;Woman;base;caregiving;cognitive process;cost;cost effective;curriculum development;daily functioning;data management;depressed patient;depression prevention;depressive symptoms;design;design and construction;eHealth;effective intervention;effective therapy;emotional distress;flexibility;improved;innovation;meetings;novel;payment;peer;peer networks;peer support;peripartum depression;pilot trial;pregnant;prevent;programs;prototype;psychologic;reduce symptoms;secondary outcome;skill acquisition;skills;skills training;symposium;theories;tool;treatment site;usability","2/2 - Online Collaborative Learning Intervention to Prevent Perinatal Depression","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Postpartum depression is common and can have a profound impact on women's well-being and the health of their babies.

"Biodefense; Emerging Infectious Diseases; Immunization; Infectious Diseases; Influenza; Pneumonia & Influenza; Prevention; Vaccine Related","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Influenza virus infections have a major impact on human health and the threat of pandemic infections remains imminent. Antibody inducing Influenza A virus (IAV) vaccines are available however protection is suboptimal and requires annual reformulation of the vaccine. IAV can escape neutralization by preexisting antibodies due to the high rate of mutation in the primary targets of neutralization (hemagglutinin HA and neuraminidase NA) and due to its capacity to recombine in non-human hosts. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies memory CD8 T-cell specific for epitopes located in conserved regions of IAV proteins like the internal components nucleoprotein (NP) polymerase A and matrix protein can confer protection. Recent human challenge studies and longitudinal analyses during the 2009 H1N1 IAV pandemic support the notion that cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells are capable of ameliorating disease when pre-existing antibodies are absent. As most humans carry a small number of these broadly protective memory CD8 T-cells increasing the number of these cells through boosting is an attractive strategy to bolster their protective capacity. However memory CD8 T-cells constitute a very heterogeneous population and little is known about how boosting or multiple antigen exposures effects CD8 T-cell mediated protection against IAV For instance we have recently reported that the type of booster agent significantly affects the localization and protective capacity of the resulting memory CD8 T-cell population (Sltter et al 2013). Therefore our long-term goal is to determine optimal memory CD8 T-cell characteristics for protection against IAV and to understand how such memory populations can be generated. In turn these studies will provide crucial information to optimize broadly protective vaccines forIAV. Specific Aim 1.  Determine the molecular mechanisms regulating CXCR3 expression in memory CD8 T  cells to enhance airway localization.  Specific Aim 2.

"HIV/AIDS","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Nlrp3 inflammasome has been linked to both protective and pathologic immune responses. Its appropriate activation triggers the innate immune response to invading pathogens including influenza virus Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans and its excessive response underlies the autoinflammatory syndromes CAPS (cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes). The Nlrp3 inflammasome is also triggered by abnormal metabolic conditions that lead to the development of common debilitating disorders such as gout type II diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. We have identified a novel step in the pathway by which the Nlrp3 inflammasome is activated that reveals a previously unrecognized overlap with the activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathways. Preliminary studies in our lab show that similar to these apoptotic pathways Nlrp3 inflammasome activation induces mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by a loss of the normal negative potential within the mitochondria. During apoptosis this loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is associated with the translocation of the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin from its location on the inner mitochondril membrane to the outer membrane. This movement is accompanied by oxidation of cardiolipin and the release of its binding partner cytochrome c to the intermembrane space. Cardiolipin on the outer mitochondrial membrane recruits and binds caspase-8 that in turn drives the generation of an outer mitochondrial membrane pore through which cytochrome c loose from its tether to cardiolipin crosses to the cytosol and triggers immunologically silent cell death byapoptosis. We now show this requirement for and ability to bind mitochondrial cardiolipin is shared by Nlrp3 previously shown to migrate to the mitochondria during activation. Additionally the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential a defining step in apoptosis is also required for Nlrp3 inflammasome activation. In this proposal we specifically dissect the role of cardiolipin in Nlrp3 activation and determine to what extent Nlrp3 inflammasome activation mirrors apoptosis. These studies will determine the point of divergence of these two pathways important not only to advance our understanding of this vital inflammatory pathway but also because once identified this switch between pathways may prove to be a target for therapeutic intervention. Manipulation of these pathways is attractive not only for modifying Nlrp3 responses but also for the potential to switch from the apoptotic pathway to an inflammatory one as could be of benefit in the setting of malignancy or covert infections.","Adaptor Signaling Protein;Agonist;Antibiotics;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;Atherosclerosis;Autoimmune Process;Binding;CASP1 gene;CASP3 gene;CASP7 gene;CASP8 gene;CASP9 gene;Candida albicans;Cardiolipins;Caspase;Cell Death;Complex;Cytosol;Data;Development;Disease;Docking;Family member;Generations;Gout;Health;Immune response;Induction of Apoptosis;Infection;Inflammatory;Interleukin-18;Invaded;Laboratories;Lead;Leucine-Rich Repeat;Ligands;Lighting;Linezolid;Link;Lipids;Location;Malignant Neoplasms;Membrane;Membrane Potentials;Metabolic;Mitochondria;Molecular;Movement;Multiprotein Complexes;NADPH Oxidase;Nature;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Nucleotides;Outer Mitochondrial Membrane;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recruitment Activity;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Source;Staphylococcus aureus;Stimulus;Syndrome;Therapeutic Intervention;autoinflammatory;chemical property;cytochrome c;cytokine;fight against;improved outcome;influenzavirus;macrophage;mitochondrial dysfunction;mitochondrial membrane;novel;oxidation;pathogen;physical property;response;secretion process;targeted treatment;tumor","Mechanism of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation by mitochondrial dysfunction","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Activation of the innate immune response is a critical step in the body's fight against infection and cancer. Immune responses can be excessive as in autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions or insufficient as in the case of overwhelming infections or invading tumors. Better understanding of the mechanisms that trigger and regulate the innate immune response will allow for smarter and safer therapies for patients suffering from these disorders. We propose to dissect the pro-inflammatory pathway of Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and determine how it differs from the similar but non-inflammatory pathway of apoptosis. Through the illumination of these pathways we can open the door to directed manipulations of these immune responses and achieve improved outcomes for patients.","NIAID","8960330","11/18/2015","PA-11-260","5R01AI104706-03","5","R01","AI","104706","03","","VAZQUEZ-MALDONADO, NANCY ","12/1/2013","3/31/2016","Innate Immunity and Inflammation Study Section[III]"," ","7774447","CASSEL, SUZANNE L.","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2015","3/31/2016"," ","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","37500"," ","NIAID","24835","12665"," ","37500",

An efficacious vaccine for malaria would be a huge boon for the >40% of humanity with regular exposure to Plasmodium infected mosquitoes. Although a partially protective vaccine (RTS S) is in phase III trials subunit vaccines to induce sterilizing liver-stage specific immunity in humans have proven difficult to develop. In contrast it has been known for over 30 years that radiation attenuated sporozoite (RAS) immunization delivered by mosquito bite can provide sterile immunity to humans. Studies in mice show clear relevance of T cells particularly CD8 T cells for sterilizing immunity to liver stage Plasmodium infection. Importantly human clinical trials of immunization with RAS are underway. In addition much recent effort has been directed at developing genetically attenuated parasite (GAP) sporozoite vaccines that may have better safety profiles and provide more reliability than RAS. GAP vaccines are also entering initial human clinical trials. Finally recent data demonstrate that sporozoite infections under chloroquine drug cover can also generate substantial protective immunity in mice and humans. However it is unknown which of these whole-sporozoite immunization regimens is most effective at generating protective T cell responses. Given the hurdles inherent in deploying a sporozoite based vaccine in the developing world pre-clinical insight into the best T cell stimulating vaccines could provide a rational basis to focus evaluation of candidate platforms and substantially accelerate progress toward an efficacious malaria vaccine. As detailed in our recent publication in PLOS Pathogens and highlighted in the preliminary data we recently applied a surrogate activation marker approach developed in our laboratory to track the total T cell response to RAS vaccination in inbred and outbred mouse strains. We now propose to use this approach to characterize the T cell response as well as antibody responses against the spectrum of candidate whole parasite vaccines in order to identify the most potent vaccines in preclinical studies. We will address this knowledge gap through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Compare the total CD8 T cell response and protective immunity in RAS versus GAP immunized inbred and outbred hosts. Specific Aim 2: Apply a surrogate activation marker approach to dissect the role of CD4 T cells in antimalarial protection after whole-sporozoite immunization. Specific Aim 3: Characterize T cell and antibody responses and protective immunity to live sporozoite infection under chloroquine drug cover in inbred and outbred hosts. Specific Aim 4: Evaluate optimal whole-parasite vaccines for the ability to elicit protective T cell and antibody responses via translationally relevant routes of immunization","Address;Africa South of the Sahara;Antibodies;Antibody Response;Antigens;Antimalarials;Attenuated;Bite;Blood;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;CD8B1 gene;Child;Chloroquine;Clinical Trials;Culicidae;Data;Disease;Down-Regulation;Epitopes;Evaluation;Exposure to;Genes;Goals;Health;Human;Humanities;Immunity;Immunization;Inbreeding;Infection;Kinetics;Knowledge;Laboratories;Life;Light;Liver;Malaria;Malaria Vaccines;Memory;Mouse Strains;Mus;Parasites;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Plasmodium;Publications;Radiation;Regimen;Role;Route;Safety;Specificity;Sporozoite vaccine;Sporozoites;Staging;Sterility;Subunit Vaccines;Surface;T cell response;T-Lymphocyte;Translations;Up-Regulation;Vaccination;Vaccines;base;design;global health;insight;irradiation;mortality;mouse model;next generation;novel strategies;pathogen;phase III trial;pre-clinical;preclinical study;radiation response;vaccine candidate;vaccine development","T cell immunity to Plasmodium sporozoite immunization","Plasmodium infections cause 300-500 million cases of malaria each year and have a devastating impact on global human health with particularly high mortality in children living in sub-Saharan Africa.

The goal of the current proposal is to directly compare the ability of each of these vaccine platforms to elicit protective T cells or antibodies and immunity to liver or blood stage infection in order to identify the most effective whole parasite vaccine.","NIAID","8960325","10/28/2015","PA-10-067","4R01AI095178-05","4","R01","AI","095178","05","","MO, ANNIE X  Y","12/1/2011","5/31/2017","Vaccines Against Microbial Diseases Study Section[VMD]"," ","1888864","HARTY, JOHN T","Not Applicable","01","MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2015","5/31/2017"," ","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016","423281"," ","NIAID","302598","120683"," ","423281",
"Genetics; Pediatric; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Iowa Child Health Research Career Development Award (CHRCDA) entitled ""Molecular and Cellular Research to Advance Child Health"" was originally established in 1990 when NICHD first developed the program. Since inception our CHRCDA program has facilitated the career development of 32 junior pediatric faculties. Our program is designed to support the academic career development of promising junior pediatric faculty. Given our history we anticipate training 7-10 Scholars for the 5-year duration of this award. This program takes advantage of our present strengths existing research programs and established investigators by placing particular emphasis on three major areas of pediatric research namely Molecular Genetics Cardiovascular Biology and Host Defenses. Specifically this program will support and foster research training of junior pediatric physician-scientists in cellular and molecular biology applied genetics and genomics animal models of human disease and translational research. The specific long-term goals and objectives of this program are: (1) to provide junior pediatric physician scientists with the research background and approaches to problem solving that they can apply to current and future studies of the genetics and functional basis of diseases that impact broadly on children's health; (2) to give junior pediatric physician-scientists formal instruction in a curriculum considered relevant and necessary for the pursuit of a successful academic research career; (3) to provide a unique environment for junior pediatric physician-scientists to study gene function across the biological spectrum from regulation at the molecular level thorough to whole organism physiology; (4) to provide junior pediatric physician-scientists with an opportunity to acquire new innovative and state-of-the-art scientific research expertise in molecular and cellular biology physiologic genomics and translational research to bridge the gap between basic science research and clinical pediatric medicine; (5) to attract the most talented junior pediatric physician-scientists and to recruit develop and train minority and women as independent investigators. To achieve these aims we have recruited 39 senior faculty Mentors from diverse departments and units throughout the Department of Pediatrics the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the College of Medicine. Oversight of the program will be achieved through regularly scheduled meetings of an Internal Advisory Committee and presentations by each of the Scholars. In addition an External Advisory Committee will meet onsite annually to review the program assess progress of the Scholars and provide feedback regarding the effectiveness and operations of the program. This program will ultimately improve the health and well being of children through innovative research fostered by the development of newly trained and highly effective child health research clinician-scientists.","Academic support;Advisory Committees;Animal Model;Applied Genetics;Area;Award;Basic Science;Biological;Biology;Cardiovascular system;Child Welfare;Child health care;Childhood;Clinical;Development;Disease;Educational Curriculum;Effectiveness;Environment;Faculty;Feedback;Fostering;Future;Genetic study;Genomics;Goals;Health;Host Defense;Institutes;Instruction;Iowa;K-Series Research Career Programs;Medical;Medicine;Minority;Molecular;Molecular Genetics;Molecular and Cellular Biology;National Institute of Child Health and Human Development;Pediatric Research;Physicians;Physiological;Physiology;Problem Solving;Program Reviews;Recording of previous events;Recruitment Activity;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Research Training;Schedule;Scientist;Training;Translational Research;Universities;Whole Organism;Woman;base;career;career development;college;design;faculty mentor;gene function;human disease;improved;innovation;meetings;operation;pediatric department;programs;senior faculty","Molecular and Cellular Research to Advance Childhood Health","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The University of Iowa Child Health Research Career Development Award will ultimately improve the health and well-being of children through innovative research fostered by development of newly trained and highly effective clinician scientists.","NICHD","8959933","12/2/2015","RFA-HD-13-011","4K12HD027748-24","4","K12","HD","027748","24","","WINER, KAREN ","2/20/2002","11/30/2017","ZHD1-DSR-A(52)"," ","1864135","HIRSCH, RAPHAEL ","Not Applicable","01","PEDIATRICS","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.664405","-91.542152","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2015","11/30/2016"," ","865","Other Research-Related","2016","395997"," ","NICHD","400000","32000"," ","395997",
"Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Endocrine Disruptors; Health Effects of Indoor Air Pollution; Neurosciences; Pediatric; Prevention","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite evidence from human and animal studies that clearly identifies neurotoxicity as the primary adverse endpoint; the long-term effects of repeated occupational and environmental exposures to organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) remain poorly understood. There is also a critical need to investigate the susceptibility of children and adolescents to pesticides since the developing brain may be uniquely sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of these agents. Partnering with colleagues at Egypt's Menoufia University we conducted a pilot study of adolescents working for the Ministry of Agriculture as pesticide applicators for the cotton crop. Building on these preliminary findings we propose a longitudinal study to investigate the relationship between sensitive and specific biomarkers of pesticide exposure effect and susceptibility and multiple measures of neurobehavioral function in this unique cohort over a 5 year period to assess cumulative and potentially reversible effects.Our overarching hypothesis is that the inherent plasticity of the developing adolescent brain will allow recovery from selected neurobehavioral deficits associated with short- and long-term exposures to pesticides. Three aims address this hypothesis expand on the successful efforts begun in the R21 project to build research skills at Menoufia and work with the Ministry of Agriculture to identify susceptible populations and put into place appropriate measures to reduce pesticide exposure. Aim 1 will determine the association between pesticide exposure and neurobehavioral function in a longitudinal study among adolescent cohorts with occupational (applicators) or environmental (non-applicators) exposures to test the hypothesis that neurobehavioral performance deficits associated with short-term exposure occur during the application season but that there is recovery of selected neurobehavioral functional domains after the summer spray season ends. Some deficits may persist beyond the spray season or after repeated summer spray seasons. A biologically- based exposure assessment will incorporate levels of urinary metabolites of chlorpyrifos and profenophos (OPs) and alpha-cypermethrin (pyrethroid) and functional polymorphisms in key enzymes involved in OP metabolism (CYP2B6 CYP2C19 and PON1) as modifiers of bioeffective dose. Aim 2 will expand the research capacity at Menoufia University by establishing a Research Institute that will: (a) build epidemiologic research capacity (b) teach grant writing and research skills in shot courses held locally and through videoconferences (c) provide mentoring and international education experiences and (d) implement a pilot project research program. This is designed to create a competitive research culture at Menoufia University. Aim 3 will develop a training program for the Ministry of Agriculture workers (including applicators) on ways to reduce exposure through hygiene behavior (work practice) change and use of protective equipment addressing both environmental (home) and occupational exposures.

"Aging; Clinical Research; Clinical Trials and Supportive Activities; Complementary and Alternative Medicine; Dietary Supplements; Nutrition; Physical Activity; Prevention; Sarcopenia","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sarcopenia defined as age related loss of muscle mass and muscle function and strength is very prevalent among the elderly. Sarcopenia is one of the largest public health problems facing a rapidly increasing aging population in the United States and leads to increased incidence of falls fractures and associated morbidities. Previous observations from our laboratory as well as from many other laboratories have demonstrated the efficacy of 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyrate (HMB) alone or in combination with other amino acids in enhancing muscle strength and function in young athletes. We have recently demonstrated that the combination of HMB with two other amino acids arginine and lysine was effective in increasing muscle mass in elderly men and women during a year-long prospective study. When analyzing the data (Preliminary Results) we demonstrated a close correlation between the levels of 25-OH Vitamin D3 in this population and the level of improvement in muscle strength. We noted that individuals with plasma 25-OH Vitamin D3 levels >30 ng/ml manifested muscle strength gains supplemented with HMB and two amino acids while those with plasma 25- OH Vitamin D3 of <30 ng/ml did not. These data form the basis of our current hypothesis that the combination of HMB and Vitamin D supplementation will be synergistic and will result in significant enhancements in overall muscle strength function and muscle mass. We propose these Phase I and Phase II studies to prove our hypothesis. The Phase I study will test the short-term (12-wk) efficacy of a combination of HMB and Vitamin D to prevent and reverse muscle sarcopenia and the associated losses of muscular strength and functionality in older adults. We plan to recruit 100 men and women who will be assigned to one of four dietary treatments: (1) Control; (2) HMB (calcium salt) 3.0 g/day; (3) 2000 IU Vitamin D; and (4) HMB 3.0 g/d + 2000 IU Vitamin D. The subjects will undergo a 3-day per week exercise program and body composition and strength will be measured at four week intervals. We expect to demonstrate the synergy between HMB and Vitamin D in this short study. Phase II will test the long-term (12-mos) efficacy of this synergistic combination of HMB and Vitamin D on the enhancement of muscle strength and functionality in the elderly thus leading to improved quality of life. Phase II will include an exercise arm just like Phase I but will also include a non-exercise arm because many elderly adults do not participate in an exercise program. In addition to body composition and function and strength data muscle biopsies will be obtained and muscle fiber and proteomic analysis will be performed. We anticipate that the data generated will lead to further research looking at mechanism(s) involved in loss of muscle and muscle function in the elderly. Improvement in muscle strength and muscle function as well as improvements in body composition over the year-long study will be used to market a product containing HMB and Vitamin D.","Adult;Affect;Age;Aging;American;Amino Acids;Arthritis;Back;Biochemical;Biopsy;Body Composition;Bone Density;Bone callus;Bone remodeling;Bunion;Calcium;Caliber;Censuses;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Cholecalciferol;Climate;Communicable Diseases;Data;Data Analyses;Deformity;Diet;Dietary Intervention;Disease;Economics;Effectiveness;Elderly;Elderly man;Elderly woman;Equilibrium;Exercise;Experimental Designs;Fall injury;Fall prevention;Fast-Twitch Muscle Fibers;Fiber;Flexor;Fracture;Functional disorder;Future;Gait;General Population;Hand Strength;Health;Incidence;Individual;Investigation;Joint Instability;Knee;Knowledge;Laboratories;Labyrinth;Lead;Legal patent;Life;Literature;Longitudinal Studies;Marketing;Measurement;Measures;Metabolic;Morbidity - disease rate;Muscle;Muscle Fibers;Muscle function;Muscular Atrophy;Musculoskeletal;Nutrient;Older Population;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Plasma;Pneumonia;Population;Probability;Prospective Studies;Proteomics;Public Health;Publishing;Quality of life;Recruitment Activity;Reporting;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Sodium Chloride;Somatotype;Structure of nail of toe;Sum;Supplementation;Techniques;Testing;Time;Toes;Translating;United States;Visual impairment;Vitamin D;Vitamin D Deficiency;Vitamin D supplementation;Vitamin D2;Woman;age related;age-related muscle loss;aging population;arginyllysine;arm;base;bone;bone turnover;clinically significant;combat;disorder prevention;economic cost;exercise program;exercise training;fall risk;falls;foot;improved;lean body mass;men;metabolic abnormality assessment;muscle aging;muscle form;muscle metabolism;muscle strength;phase 1 study;phase 2 study;phase I trial;prevent;prospective;protein degradation;reduced muscle strength;sarcopenia;screening;sports related nutrition","Nutritional Intervention for Age-Related Muscular Function and Strength Losses","Current estimates place a large portion of the older U.S. populous at risk for falls with potential morbidities.

"No NIH Category available","With this application we request funds from the ORD Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (SheEEP) topurchase a new confocal microscope to be housed in the Inflammation Program laboratories of the Iowa CityVA Medical Center. Specifically we seek to obtain a model LSM 880 confocal microscope manufactured byCarl Zeiss Inc. The rationale for this purchase is threefold. First our current confocal microscope a ZeissLSM 510 is 18 years old and as of September 2016 will be officially obsolete. As such parts andmaintenance will no longer be available and the instrument which plays a critical role in many researchprograms will become unusable. Second we have the opportunity to take advantage of a 20% trade-updiscount on purchase of the LSM 880. Third and most importantly there are several features of the LSM 880that place it at the forefront of confocal technology. Thus acquisition of an LSM 880 will support cutting edgeresearch and will allow the development of new research projects and new collaborations among scientists ofthe Iowa City VA research program which has a long-standing record of excellence and achievement.Our research portfolio is diverse and includes studies of several infectious diseases inflammation andimmunity glaucoma and blindness and heart disease as well as studies of anxiety depression PTSDAlzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease and other neurological disorders. Confocal microscopy is importantto all these studies as it allows fundamental cellular processes to be visualized at high magnification in live andfixed cells of the immune system brain heart and other tissues. Specifically research groups and projects forwhich the LSM 880 is critical are: 1) Manipulation of apoptosis pyroptosis and autophagy in macrophages byFrancisella tularensis (Dr. Allen). 2) Induction of neutrophil subtype differentiation and DNA release uponHelicobacter pylori infection (Dr. Allen). 3) Studies of microvesicle (ectosome and exosome) release duringbacterial infection (Drs.

Theexperiments will be performed using a mouse model developed at the Iowa City Department of VeteransAffairs Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss (CPTVL) that has an ocular phenotype (retinalganglion cell damage) and neurological deficits (learning memory and coordination problems) present inhumans. Mild TBI generates abnormal neuronal activity in the mouse model. At molecular level the abnormalneuronal function could be the result of changes in the receptors of the main inhibitory neurotransmitter -aminobutyric acid (GABA). The first aim is to identify molecular changes in the expression composition andlocalization of GABAA receptors in the retina and the brain of mice exposed to blast.The second aim is to find therapeutic agents that mitigate the abnormal firing activity of retinal ganglion cellsthat we have discovered to occur following blast-induced mild TBI. Electrophysiologic and pharmacologic toolswill be used to test the effects of GABAA receptor targeting pharmacologic agents on neuronal activity toestablish if they can restore proper function after mild TBI. The GABAA receptors can be targeted by a widevariety of well-characterized therapeutic agents (benzodiazepines barbiturates neurosteroids and inhaledanesthetics) that modulate their function. By defining the molecular and functional changes in the GABAAreceptors induced by blast-mediated TBI drugs that can compensate for the alterations in the GABAergicsystem can be identified and tested. Normalizing the neuronal activity and preventing the death of neuronswhich we assume ultimately occurs in neurons exhibiting abnormal firing patterns will result in preservedvisual and cognitive functions.To ensure the clinical applicability of the research performed and that the applicant learns the necessary toolsand skills to perform basic research with strong implications for translation into clinical practice one of thementors is a practicing psychiatrist.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Diabetes is a worldwide public health problem. Veterans are disproportionally impacted by diabetes compared to the general population. Diabetes exacts a heavy toll on veterans doubling their risk of death. The majority of hospitalizations and deaths in veterans with diabetesare due to vascular complications such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Diabetes leads to these complications because it promotes dysfunction of the vascular endothelium and accelerates atherosclerosis.  Oxidative stress has many deleterious effects on blood vessel function and is a prominent feature of the diabetic vasculature. P66shc is a protein expressed in diabetic blood vessels where it stimulates oxidative stress. P66shc is a major factor responsible for diabetic vascular dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis. How p66shc is regulated in diabetic blood vessels is not known. The immediate goal of this application is to understand the fundamental mechanism governing p66shc function in diabetic blood vessels with the eventual goal of leveraging this knowledge to prevent and treat diabetic vascular disease.  This application will explore a novel relationship between p66shc and the SIRTUIN1 (SIRT1) lysine deacetylase in the diabetic vascular endothelium. It centers on the novel hypothesis that endothelial p66shc is lysine acetylated in diabetes that lysine acetylation activates p66shc thatlysine acetylated p66shc plays an indispensable role in leading to diabetic vascular dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis and SIRT1 ameliorates diabetic vascular disease by directly deacetylating endothelial p66shc. Studies proposed in this application will ask 1) how lysine acetylation by diabetes activates p66shc at the molecular level thus promoting oxidative stress in the vascular endothelium and 2) whether diabetic vascular dysfunction and disease can be prevented or retarded if p66shc cannot be acetylated. It will address these points by using unique molecular tools including mice lacking endothelial SIRT1 and mice in which endothelial p66shc is not acetylatable.  Why investigate this novel relationship between SIRT1 and p66shc? Current therapies to treat or prevent diabetic vascular disease and its attendant complications including heart attacks and strokes are woefully inadequate. Even reducing blood sugar has proven largely ineffective in preventing atherosclerotic complications of diabetics. Add to this that there are several pharmaceuticals that have been developed as activators of SIRT1 and are safe when given to humans. If studies in this application prove that SIRT1 plays a major beneficial role in preventing vascular dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis of diabetes by deacetylating p66shc these SIRT1 activators could find a new use in the treatment of diabetic vascular disease. In addition showing that lysine acetylation of p66shc is the principal mechanism responsible for diabetic vascular disease could open the door for developing pharmaceuticals that target this acetylation pathway as novel therapies for diabetic vascular complications.      ","Acetylation;Address;Atherosclerosis;Attention;Binding;Blood Glucose;Blood Vessels;Cessation of life;Cholesterol;Complications of Diabetes Mellitus;Cytochromes;Deacetylase;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Angiopathies;Diagnosis;Disease;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Down-Regulation;Endothelium;Enzymes;FOXO3A gene;Family;Figs - dietary;Functional disorder;General Population;Goals;Health Benefit;Health system;Hospitalization;Human;Knock-in Mouse;Knowledge;Lead;Lysine;Mediating;Mitochondria;Molecular;Mus;Myocardial Infarction;NADPH Oxidase;Nitric Oxide;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Oxidative Stress;Pathway interactions;Pharmacologic Substance;Phosphorylation;Play;Population;Proteins;Public Health;Reactive Oxygen Species;Recruitment Activity;Risk;Role;Serine;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Endothelium;Vasodilation;Veterans;antioxidant enzyme;clinically relevant;design;diabetic;endothelial dysfunction;member;mitochondrial permeability transition pore;mortality;novel;novel therapeutics;p66(ShcA) protein;prevent;protein function;public health relevance;stroke;therapeutic target;tool;vascular endothelial dysfunction;vasculogenesis","SIRTUIN1-mediated inhibition of p66shc lysine acetylation as a novel treatment for diabetic vasculopathy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE      One in every four Veterans in the VA Health System has diabetes.

"No NIH Category available","This multi-center VA study of visual function and structure in veterans after mild Traumatic BrainInjury (Palo Alto Minneapolis and Iowa City VA Medical Centers) will address two main topicareas identified as priorities for the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC): 1)Studies which focus on understanding neurosensory deficits associated with chronic mildTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and 2) Studies which assess diagnostics and prognostic measuresfor neural degeneration. The main aims of the grant are to prospectively study visual structuraland functional consequences of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the eye and theirconnections in the brain to determine if progressive worsening occurs and to compare ocularand brain biomarkers of structure and function for diagnosis and prognosis. With this proposal amore complete picture of the spectrum of visual sensory disturbances after mTBI will beobtained by utilizing more detailed tests of visual function and ocular motility as well as newerstructural analyses of OCT combined with functional MRI imaging of visual pathways in thebrain (fMRI) and volume analysis of corresponding grey and white matter locations. Wehypothesize that after mild TBI structural and functional biomarkers of damage are moreprevalent than previously appreciated in the eye and corresponding visual centers of the brainproviding the first evidence linking TBI-induced neural degeneration to eye and brain locations.Our second main hypothesis is that mild TBI and repeated episodes can cause a chronicprogressive decline in eye and CNS biomarkers of vision in a subset of susceptible veterans.This is based on strong preliminary data from our own studies and that of our collaborators inhumans and in established animal models of mild TBI which show that acute injury initiatesvisual pathway damage leading to a chronic progressive process of neural degeneration. Thisproposal will have two Specific Aims - 1: Determine whether ocular functional and structuralbiomarkers after mild TBI significantly correlate with corresponding visual pathway biomarkersin the brain. 2: Determine whether ocular and corresponding location CNS biomarkers progressover time after mild TBI. Currently it is not known if neuronal loss in the retina and brain aftermTBI continues to progress over time.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION :       Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States. This disease is strongly age-related and affects approximately 1.9% of the US population 40 years or older and is highly prevalent in veterans. The development of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is closely associated with the development of glaucoma and results from increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork (TM).  To date there is no cure for glaucoma. Vision loss is permanent and while elevated IOP can be managed through medical or surgical means it does not resolve permanently. Current medical treatment requires daily or twice daily application of one or more eye drops for the remainder of a patient's life. Despite the importance of maintaining a well-controlled IOP patient compliance is poor resulting in lack of IOP control and progressive vision loss. Elderly patients in particuar suffer from involuntary non-compliance due to the difficulty of applying the drops to their eyes. Lack of compliance is a major challenge in the clinical management of the disease and consequently the development of treatment modalities that lead to permanent reliable IOP control is highly desirable.  The overall goal of this project is to develop new approaches to restore healthy IOP in patients with glaucoma. Specifically we propose to evaluate whether replacement of damaged or lost trabecular meshwork (TM) cells with stem cell derived TM like cells can induce functional restoration following transplantation into glaucoma eyes. We hypothesize that replacement of lost or damaged TM cells with healthy cells can preserve or restore aqueous humor outflow facility decrease IOP and thus preserve vision. The source of these cells is of course crucial. A patient's native TM cells are difficult to obtain and may additionally be functionally compromised due to the effects of age-related stresses. We propose that the use of TM-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC-TM) which can be created from the patient's own dermal fibroblasts obtained from a skin biopsy offers the best solution to this challenge.  In order to test our hypothesis we will induce iPSC to differentiate ito iPSC-TM and test them functionally in an ocular perfusion organ culture system. Human donor eyes will receive a transplantation of iPSC-TM and will be monitored for up to three weeks for integration of stem cells into the TM changes in the eye's outflow capacity and changes in the TM extracellular matrix. We will also test our hypothesis using a new mouse model of glaucoma which was recently developed by the P.I. and his collaborators. These mice which develop elevated IOP due to a transgene expressing a pathogenic mutation myocilin are uniquely suited for these studies because damage to the structure of their TM is mild even though TM cells become dysfunctional.  This unique and novel approach could provide effective permanent vision saving treatment for veterans with POAG as well as other types of glaucoma such as exfoliation glaucoma. Upon completion of these studies we expect to have obtained conclusive data to determine if TM regeneration using stem cell derived TM-like cells is an effective and safe approach that could be used to treat patients with glaucoma. We expect that the proposed study will point out novel treatment approaches for the prevention of vision loss in veterans who suffer from glaucoma that is difficult to manage or who face challenges preventing consistent use of IOP lowering medications.","Affect;Aqueous Humor;Biological Models;Biopsy;Blindness;Caring;Cell Line;Cell Transplantation;Cells;Characteristics;Clinical;Clinical Management;Clinical Trials;Coculture Techniques;Compliance behavior;Data;Dermal;Development;Disease;Disease Management;Drops;Elderly;Ensure;Ethics;Extracellular Matrix;Eye;Eye Banks;Eye diseases;Eyedrops;Face;Familiarity;Fibroblasts;Functional disorder;Funding;Genetic;Glaucoma;Goals;Graft Rejection;Harvest;Head;Health;Human;Immune;Injection of therapeutic agent;Iowa;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Medical;Medical Records;Methodology;Methods;Modality;Monitor;Mus;Mutation;Natural regeneration;Operative Surgical Procedures;Organ Culture Techniques;Patients;Perfusion;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Physiological;Population;Prevention approach;Primary Open Angle Glaucoma;Procedures;Regulation;Research;Research Personnel;Residencies;Resistance;Resources;Risk;Risk Factors;Safety;Sampling;Services;Site;Skin;Source;Specialist;Stem cells;Stress;Structure;System;Testing;Tissues;Trabecular meshwork structure;Transgenes;Transplantation;United States;Universities;Veterans;Vision;Visit;age related;anterior chamber;base;cell type;clinically relevant;cost;expectation;experience;functional restoration;induced pluripotent stem cell;innovation;mouse model;myocilin;non-compliance;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;older patient;prevent;restoration;standard of care;stem cell biology;stem cell therapy;therapy development","Stem Cell Therapy for Glaucoma","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Glaucoma is a common disease of the eye that decreases vision and can lead to blindness. It particularly affects older persons including approximately 285000 Veterans. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for the development of glaucoma and lowering IOP is currently the only known treatment for the disease. Life-long daily eye drops is the current medical standard of care but patient compliance is often poor and older persons have additional difficulties applying the drops to their eyes. The VA spends a significant - and increasing- portion of its medical care funds toward treatment of vision loss requiring approximately five million visits per year. We propose to use induced pluripotent stem cells to regenerate the trabecular meshwork the site of IOP regulation. Cells can be created from skin samples obtained from the patient avoiding both ethical and immune rejection concerns. Successful trabecular meshwork restoration would permanently restore IOP control and thereby reduce costs related to the management of this disease.","VA","9108889","7/8/2016","RX-13-001","5I01RX001163-03","5","I01","RX","001163","03","","","7/1/2014","6/30/2018","Regenerative Rehabilitation[RRD0]"," ","6815499","KUEHN, MARKUS H.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","US","41.653383","-91.540485","481031","IOWA CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER","IOWA CITY","IA","Independent Hospitals","522462208","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2016","6/30/2017"," ","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Leishmaniasis refers to a group of common parasitic diseases that are highly endemic in many nations including most Middle Eastern countries. Military personnel are at risk for this vector-borne disease. Indeed leishmaniasis reached epidemic proportions in the US military during the Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and New Dawn (OND). The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic leishmaniasis varies from 6:1 to 98:1 in different studies. It is therefore highly likely that there are many more unrecognized infections in our military personnel than the ~600 reported.  Leishmania have the ability to persist in a host even after clinical ""cure"". Indeed infected humans and other hosts may never clear the infection even after disease symptoms resolve. Leishmania are known to exert a profound effect on innate and adaptive immune responses of the host during infection. Recent evidence documents that immune effects persist even after ""cure"" of disease. Thus it is highly likely that the immune effects of leishmaniasis extend beyond measurable symptomatic disease.  Exosomes are small vesicles released from most living cells that contain protein RNA and lipids from the cell of origin. Exosomes are now recognized as major vessels transporting immune and other response signals between host cells. Recently it was recognized that exosomes are released from Leishmania parasites. These tiny packages of information may provide clues that explain the profound systemic effects of Leishmania infection.  We have already characterized the protein content of exosomes from different life stages of Leishmania infantum one of the causative agents of leishmaniasis in the Middle East. The current proposal is based on the hypothesis that proteins and small RNAs released in exosomes from Leishmania or from Leishmania-infected cells are responsible for the dramatic and persistent local and systemic effects of leishmaniasis on immune cell responses. These effects could be invoked during active or during asymptomatic infection. Our corollary posits that Leishmania parasites themselves release exosomes whose contents affect the intracellular environment and which become incorporated themselves into exosomes released from host cells. An understanding of the host- and parasite-derived content of released exosomes therefore would provide the basis for novel approaches to diagnosis and therapy of leishmaniasis. Specific aims of this project are: Aim #1. Identify the protein and small RNA content of exosomes and the pathway of exosome release from macrophages infected with L. major or L. infantum. Hypothesis: Exosomes from leishmania- infected macrophages contain protein and microRNAs that promote non-classical activation of infected macrophages. Aim #2. Identify proteins and small RNAs in the serum and urine exosomes from members of the US military who acquired cutaneous leishmaniasis in Iraq and determine whether exosome proteins elicit an immune response in humans or in mice infected with L. major or L. infantum. Hypothesis: Exosomes released from Leishmania-infected mammalian cells contain dominant parasite antigens that generate an immune response in the infected individual. Aim #3. Document the immunomodulatory properties of exosomes from parasites from infected macrophages or circulating in serum of humans with leishmaniasis. Immune responses will be tested in human macrophages and in mouse models of L. major and L. infantum infection. Hypothesis: Exosomes exhibit functional enzymatic activities that affect the activation state and the microbicidal response of both the infected and bystander host immune cells.      ","Affect;Afghanistan;American;Antigens;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Country;Cutaneous;Cutaneous Leishmaniasis;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Distant;Environment;Epidemic;Exhibits;Freedom;HIV Infections;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immunity;Immunocompromised Host;Individual;Infection;Iraq;Kuwait;Lead;Leishmania;Leishmania infantum;Leishmania major;Leishmaniasis;Life;Lipids;Location;Mammalian Cell;Measurable;Mediator of activation protein;Methods;MicroRNAs;Microbe;Middle East;Military Personnel;Mus;Nature;Organ;Parasites;Parasitic Diseases;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Persons;Property;Proteins;Protozoa;Publications;RNA;Reporting;Risk;Role;Sampling;Serum;Signal Transduction;Skin Ulcer;Small RNA;Soldier;Staging;Symptoms;Testing;Urine;Vector-transmitted infectious disease;Vesicle;Virulence;Visceral;Visceral Leishmaniasis;World War II;adaptive immunity;base;cell type;exosome;human disease;macrophage;member;microbial;microbicide;monocyte;mouse model;novel strategies;operation;peripheral blood;public health relevance;response;vesicular release","The Role of Exosomes in the Pathogenesis of Leishmaniasis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Major outbreaks of the parasitic disease leishmaniasis have affected military personnel during recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most Leishmania infections are asymptomatic; thus there are likely many more infections than the ~600 reported symptomatic cases. Leishmania have dramatic effects on the host immune response and infections tend to persist long-term leading us to hypothesize that there may be immune consequences of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. In this application we propose to examine the content and function of small vesicles called exosomes released from Leishmania parasites and from human cells infected with the parasite. Exosomes spread mediators of immune responses throughout the host. We hypothesize that Leishmania-derived exosomes may be responsible for the profound effects of these parasites on host immunity.

Post-traumatic headache is unfortunatel very prevalent in Veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts who have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Post-traumatic headache with concurrent photosensitivity are two of the most prevalent problems reported by military personnel following TBI. This photosensitivity is commonly referred to as photophobia and may occur independently or in association with headache. To date there is no objective measurement of headache or photophobia. This proposal will test the hypothesis that photosensitivity in mice will be a useful diagnostic tool fo testing of candidate drugs. In the first aim the plan will be to establish photosensitivity in mic following mild TBI as a preclinical model for post-traumatic headache. An overpressure chamber protocol will be used to model mild blast injury. Photosensitivity will be measured in a transgenicmouse model using a combination of light aversive behavior and translatable assays of periocular responses and facial discomfort. Our preliminary data indicate there is time-dependent development of light aversion in wild type mice following overpressure exposure. Development of these assays will establish an optimal preclinical model for testing candidate drugs to treat or prevent post-TBI headache. In the second aim we will evaluate the therapeutic efficacies of two complementary agents: (1) a monoclonal antibody against the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and (2) a neuroprotective agent (P7C3-S243) that our team has recently shown to reduce blast- induced neural damage. The effects of a CGRP-blocking antibody and P7C3-S243 will be tested by monitoring light aversion and the periocular and facial responses post-TBI. Histochemical markers of axonal degeneration and cell death in regions implicated in photosensitivity will also be examined as indicators of efficacy after P7C3-S243 treatment. A strength of this study is that we have formed an interdisciplinary multi-PI team with expertise in molecular and behavioral neurosciences biomedical engineering and clinical aspects of photophobia who are all members of the VA Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Vision Loss. The significance of this study is the potential clinical application of to classes of promising therapeutic agents to improve the quality of life in a large population of Veterans. The expected results will establish an objective measurement of an otherwise subjective pain state that affects a disproportionately large number of Veterans with post-traumatic headache. Importantly this study will provide the foundation for future clinical trials using the CGRP antibody and P7C3 agents for treatment of Veterans who have suffered from mild TBI.      ","Address;Affect;Afghanistan;Air Pressure;Animals;Attenuated;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Biological Markers;Biomedical Engineering;Blast Cell;Blast Injuries;Blindness;Blocking Antibodies;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Calcitonin-Gene Related Peptide Receptor;Carbazoles;Cell Death;Chronic;Chronic Headaches;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Conflict (Psychology);Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diagnostic;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Dose;Ensure;Face;Foundations;Future;Goals;Headache;Iraq;Light;Measurable;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Migraine;Military Personnel;Modeling;Molecular;Monitor;Monoclonal Antibodies;Mus;Neuropeptides;Neuroprotective Agents;Neurosciences;Pain;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Peptide antibodies;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Photophobia;Photosensitivity;Population;Post-Traumatic Headaches;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevalence;Prevention;Productivity;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Reporting;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Time;Transgenic Mice;Traumatic Brain Injury;Treatment Efficacy;Veterans;Wild Type Mouse;Woman;assay development;axonal degeneration;base;clinical application;drug candidate;experience;improved;insight;member;men;mild traumatic brain injury;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;patient subsets;persistent symptom;pre-clinical;prevent;public health relevance;relating to nervous system;response;socioeconomics;tool;treatment strategy","Photosensitivity as a preclinical assessment for treatment of post-traumatic headache","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Post-traumatic headache is a common pain condition that affects a disproportionately large number of Veterans who have suffered mild traumatic brain injury.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Objective: A major objective of this proposal is to train Dr. Sowers to become an independent translational neuroscientist in the VA system. To accomplish this he has prepared a research plan that will allow training in state-of-the-art optogenetic techniques to address a major issue facing Veterans post-traumatic headache. Veterans returning from active duty are at an increased risk for post-traumatic headache that includes migraine. U.S. military personnel screened within 90 days of returning from a one-year combat tour in Iraq had 2-4 times the rate of migraine compared to civilians. One debilitating aspect of post traumatic headache is concurrent photophobia which can negatively affect Veterans daily lives. Interventions and treatments for post- traumatic headache and photophobia remain inadequate due to a poor understanding of the relevant neuroanatomical correlates. This proposal aims to identify brain regions that are directly involved with the development of post-traumatic headache and photosensitivity and test pharmacological agents to mitigate light sensitivity. As a starting point we plan to focus on areas implicated in light aversion and modulated by the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Our findings will overcome two major hindrances in the development of future treatments for Veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) by determining: first which brain regions are sufficient to induce photophobia and second whether these regions are necessary for the development of TBI induced photophobia. The results from these studies will guide future innovative therapeutic interventions such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial stimulation for the treatment of this debilitating chronic condition of TBI. This stuy will be aided by clinical interactions with his multidisciplinary mentoring team two of which are practicing psychiatrists within the VA system as well as a neuro-ophthalmologist. Dr. Sowers will have access to a large TBI population at the Center for the Treatment and Prevention of Visual Loss. The training plan will also take advantage of interactions with clinicians and basic scientists in the VA Center. Moreover Dr. Sowers' mentor has ongoing collaborations with two pharmaceutical companies (Alder and Eli Lilly) that will facilitate the translation of the expectedfindings to clinical trials. These clinical perspectives will not only aid with the applicant's traning but will also focus the research plan on a fast translational timeframe. Methods: We have established a pre-clinical blast-induced light-aversion model as an objective indicator of post-traumatic headache. In Aim 1 we will use optogenetic applications to target specific brain regions we hypothesize to be involved with the development of post-traumatic headache. In Aim 2 we will use pharmacological manipulation of CGRP to alleviate post-traumatic headache in C57BL/6J wild type mice. Expected results: This proposal will have three main outcomes: 1) It will establish the applicant as an expert in pre-clinical TBI models that are closely linked to translational testing of novel therapeutics. 2) It will significantly advance our understanding of the neuroanatomy underlying post-traumatic headache and photophobia by identifying brain regions that could be targets for specific deep brain stimulation or transcranial stimulatory treatments. 3) The proposed work will benefit Veterans by identifying future pharmacological treatments to ameliorate post-traumatic headache.      ","Absenteeism at work;Address;Affect;Alder plant;Amygdaloid structure;Anatomy;Area;Award;Behavior;Behavioral;Biological Assay;Blast Cell;Blast Injuries;Blindness;Boxing;Brain;Brain region;Budgets;Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide;Cell Nucleus;Chronic;Chronic Headaches;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Collaborations;Comorbidity;Data;Deep Brain Stimulation;Development;Diagnosis;Epilepsy;Etiology;Foundations;Functional disorder;Future;Goals;Grant;Grant Review;Headache;Human;Incidence;Intervention;Iraq;K-Series Research Career Programs;Knowledge;Learning;Light;Link;Manuscripts;Mentors;Methods;Migraine;Military Personnel;Modeling;Mus;Neuroanatomy;Neuropeptides;Neurosciences;Ophthalmologist;Outcome;Patients;Peptide antibodies;Pharmacologic Substance;Pharmacological Treatment;Photophobia;Photosensitivity;Play;Population;Post-Traumatic Headaches;Prevalence;Prevention;Psychiatrist;Quality of life;Recording of previous events;Research;Research Methodology;Research Personnel;Risk;Role;Scientist;System;Techniques;Testing;Thalamic structure;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;TimeLine;Training;Translations;Traumatic Brain Injury;Veterans;Wild Type Mouse;Work;associated symptom;base;career;combat;effective therapy;experience;injured;innovation;multidisciplinary;neurophysiology;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;optogenetics;patch clamp;pre-clinical;programs;public health relevance;skills;symposium;targeted treatment;therapy development;treatment center","Identification and treatment of brain regions causing post-traumatic headache","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   Veterans who have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) suffer from an increased prevalence of persistent migraine-like post-traumatic headaches for which treatments remain inadequate.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Papilledema - a specific type of optic nerve edema associated with elevated intracranial pressure - occurs in veterans due to intracranial masses or hemorrhage obstructive hydrocephalus following traumatic brain injury and from idiopathic causes. Currently the diagnosis of papilledema and its severity are assessed by direct funduscopic observation or digital fundus photographs using a six-stage grading scale. The scale is qualitative categorical subject to inter-rater variability requires clinical expertise and does not distinguish papilledea from other causes of optic nerve edema. Recent developments in the automated image-analysis of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images have led to the availability of continuous quantitative measures (such as the total retinal volume) of edema severity. However optical coherence tomography is still too expensive to become readily available outside specialized ophthalmology clinics. Use of low-cost portable color fundus cameras is a more economically viable imaging option in telemedical and emergency settings but there currently exists no objective method of analyzing and classifying the cause and severity of optic nerve edema. The overall objective of this project is to develop automated color-fundus-photograph-based image-analysis strategies to rapidly and accurately determine the severity of optic nerve edema and to ascertain features that differentiate its cause. The central hypothesis is that through the use ofoptical-coherence-tomgraphy-based severity measures as a reference standard for computer-based learning of color-fundus-photograph features the ability to automatically estimate the severity of optic nerve edema in telemedical settings (where only color fundus photographs are likely to be available) will be improved. The rationale for the proposed research is that having automated methods for determination of the severity and cause of optic nerve edema from fundus photographs will enable earlier diagnosis of vision- and life-threatening conditions in telemedical and emergency settings in veterans. The following specific aims will be pursued:  1. Develop and evaluate the automated methodology for computing swollen-optic-nerve-head-  relevant features from color fundus photographs. This will be completed by refining and augmenting  automated fundus-image-analysis approaches for computation of global/regional vascular textural and  optic-disc boundary features in patients with optic nerve edema. The relevance of these features will first  be evaluated in this aim via their associations with expertdefined severity rankings.  2. Identify features from color fundus photographs that optimally correlate with OCT-based  measurements of severity in patients with optic nerve edema and develop a fundus-photograph-  based continuous severity scale. This will be accomplished by using machine-learning approaches to  relate global/regional fundus-based features to recently developed novel automated OCT-based  measures of severity (e.g. the total retinal volume). It is expected that fundus-based severity measures  using the developed automated approach will better correlate (than expert-defined Frisn scale grades -  the current clinical fundus-based ordinal severity scale) with OCT-based measures of severity.  3. Identify features from color fundus photographs that differentiate papilledema from other causes  of optic disc swelling and develop a predictive classifier. The working hypothesis is that regional  differences around the optic disc will contribute the most in the automatic differentiation process. The approach is innovative because the use of automated image-analysis algorithms for assessing the extent and cause of optic nerve edema in low-cost images reflects a significant department from the status quo of relying on qualitative information. The proposed research is significant because it will help to establish much- needed quantitative and objective methods by which to assess the severity and cause of optic disc swelling of veterans in telemedical and emergency settings.      ","Accident and Emergency department;Algorithms;Bilateral;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Clinic;Clinical;Color;Communities;Computing Methodologies;Development;Diagnosis;Dimensions;Disease;E-learning;Early Diagnosis;Edema;Emergency Situation;Fundus;Health;Hemorrhage;Image;Image Analysis;Imaging Techniques;Inflammatory;Intracranial Hypertension;Investigation;Ischemic Optic Neuropathy;Lead;Life;Machine Learning;Measurement;Measures;Methodology;Methods;Monitor;Morbidity - disease rate;Obstructive Hydrocephalus;Ophthalmologist;Ophthalmology;Optic Disk;Optic Nerve;Optical Coherence Tomography;Optics;Papilledema;Patients;Process;Reference Standards;Research;Resolution;Retinal;Severities;Staging;Swelling;Techniques;Testing;Traumatic Brain Injury;Veterans;Vision;Work;accurate diagnosis;base;cost;digital;expectation;improved;innovation;mortality;novel;outreach;public health relevance;regional difference;standard of care","Automated Assessment of Optic Nerve Edema with Low-Cost Imaging","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE   The proposed research is relevant to Veterans' health because automated objective approaches for assessing the severity and cause of optic nerve edema using low-cost fundus photographs is expected to enable a more efficient and accurate means by which non-experts (i.e. non-neuro-ophthalmologists) present in telemedical and emergency-room settings can make a preliminary diagnosis and better determine the urgency of further investigations or referral.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Heart failure is the number one reason for discharge for Veterans treated in VA health care system. Heart failure measured at the organ level is the result of cellular failure due to impairment of cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. One key structural component of E-C coupling is the myocyte transverse (T)-tubule system. T-tubules play essential roles in membrane excitation coordinated and synchronized activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release and muscle contraction. In failing myocytes from animal models and human patients we and others have shown that the regularly arrayed T-tubule system undergoes disruptive remodeling leading to aberrant intracellular Ca2+ release and compromised myocyte contractility. Our recently published data strongly suggest that T-tubule structural integrity is acritical structural determinant of myocardial contractile function. Moreover we found that loss ofprotein expression of junctophilin-2 (JP2) a structural protein spanning T-tubules and the SR membrane is a causative factor in T-tubule deformation in heart disease. Substantial evidence demonstrates that E-C coupling is impaired by oxidative stress which is elevated in cardiomyocytes in heart disease. Despite the clear role for oxidative stress in cardiomyopathies antioxidant trials in humans have failed to provide a therapeutic benefit suggesting an incomplete understanding of oxidative stress-mediated pathways in heart disease or possibly wrong antioxidant strategy used in previous clinical trials. Previous reports have provided solid evidence that protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by oxidative stress. At the cellular level PKC has been shown to impair E-C coupling. In pilot studies activation of PKC resulted in alterations in cardiomyocyte structure and function. However in order to identify new treatment strategies for heart disease that preserve cardiac contractility there is a critical need to determine the mechanism by which PKC activation by oxidative stress induces E-C coupling dysfunction. The objective/goal of this application is to determine the mechanistic link between excessive oxidative stress PKC signaling and development and progression of heart failure. We will combine multidisciplinary approaches including in situ confocal imaging electrophysiology molecular biology pathological mouse models and novel transgenic mouse models to test our hypothesis. Accomplishment of our studies will advance our understanding and provide new insights into the mechanisms of oxidative stress-mediated PKC activation and T-tubule remodeling in heart failure pathophysiology and is expected to have an important positive impact by revealing new targets for heart failure therapeutics.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Skeletal muscle atrophy represents an enormous unmet medical need in Veteran patients. Frequent causes of skeletal muscle atrophy include orthopedic injuries bed rest advanced age cancer heart failure COPD diabetes stroke renal failure critical illness and spinal cord injuy. Effects of skeletal muscle atrophy include weakness reduced activity falls fractures debilitation prolonged hospitalization and rehabilitation nursing home placement and increased mortality. Although skeletal muscle atrophy has broad clinical impact in the Veteran population a pharmacologic therapy for muscle atrophy does not exist and current therapeutic approaches (nutrition and physical rehabilitation) are often ineffective and/or unfeasible. Our long-term goal is to develop a pharmacologic therapy for skeletal muscle atrophy. In preliminary studies we studied human subjects to determine mRNA expression signatures of human skeletal muscle atrophy and then used these signatures in conjunction with a novel drug discovery method to identify two small molecules (ursolic acid and compound A) as predicted pharmacologic inhibitors of human skeletal muscle atrophy. Using mouse models we found that ursolic acid and compound A prevent and reverse skeletal muscle atrophy increase muscle strength and improve exercise capacity. In addition to these effects in mice we found that ursolic acid and compound A stimulate growth of human skeletal myotubes an in vitro model of human skeletal muscle. Importantly data from us and others suggest that ursolic acid and compound A have favorable safety profiles suggesting good potential for translation to Veteran patients. Although these data identify ursolic acid and compound A as exciting potential therapeutic agents to prevent and reverse skeletal muscle atrophy in Veteran patients some critical questions remain unanswered. For example we do not yet understand how ursolic acid and compound A reduce muscle atrophy and improve muscle function. In addition ursolic acid and compound A are structurally dissimilar and exhibit some differences in their physiological and biochemical effects suggesting that the combination of ursolic acid and compound A could be more beneficial than either compound alone. To determine mechanisms of action and potential for combination therapy we propose two aims. In Specific Aim 1 we will use human skeletal myotubes to determine cellular mechanisms that ursolic acid and compound A utilize to increase muscle mass and improve muscle function. Since skeletal muscle mass and function are tightly linked to skeletal muscle protein mitochondria and anabolic signaling we will test th hypotheses that ursolic acid and compound A increase the net balance of protein synthesis to protein degradation increase mitochondrial mass and respiration and stimulate anabolic signaling. Collectively these studies will provide an important mechanistic foundation for clinica studies of ursolic acid and compound A in patients with skeletal muscle atrophy. In Specific Aim 2 we will use mouse models to determine if the combination of ursolic acid and compound A is more beneficial than either compound alone. We will test the hypotheses that the combination of ursolic acid and compound A prevents and reverses skeletal muscle atrophy increases strength and improves exercise capacity more than either compound alone. If the combination of ursolic acid and compound A demonstrates additional benefit in muscle atrophy combination therapy would be carried forward to clinical studies.

In our preliminary research we discovered two chemical compounds that prevent and treat muscle wasting in mice. We find that these compounds also improve strength and exercise in mice. In the research that we are proposing we will study how these compounds reduce muscle wasting and improve strength and exercise. We will also test whether combining these two compounds reduces muscle wasting and improves muscle function more than either compound alone.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Hematopoietic and leukemic stem cells (HSCs and LSCs respectively) are endowed with unlimited self-renewal capacity. This unique ability of HSCs is responsible for sustaining lifetimeproduction of multiple blood lineages and HSC transplantation represents the most widely deployed regenerative therapy. On the other hand LSCs are responsible for initiation maintenance and propagation of various types of leukemia. A cure for leukemia depends on the ability to eradicate LSCs after effective debulking of leukemic cells with conventional chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore there are imperative needs to seek in-depth understanding of how HSC and LSC self-renewal is regulated by intrinsic and environmental factors.  -catenin activation can be elicited by Wnt proteins or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its roles in HSCs and LSCs remain an extensively debated issue. It is known that activated -catenin translocate into the nucleus where it interacts with Tcf/Lef transcription factors thus far there is little informationon how - catenin activity is connected to transcriptional program changes. Based on our focused analysis on Tcf1 and Lef1 we hypothesize that Tcf/Lef and /-catenin proteins constitute distinct regulatory modules in HSCs and their respective transcriptional programs are therapeutic targets for eradicating LSCs. In the following 2 aims we seek to systematically elucidate distinct roles of each module in HSC biology and mechanistically assess beneficial roles of PGE1 in targeting LSCs as outlined in the figure below. Specific Aim 1. To dissect the roles of Tcf3/Tcf4 and /-catenin modules in HSCs and LSCs. Specific Aim 2. To investigate the therapeutic benefits of PGE1 in treating CML.  Veterans have increased exposure to harmful environments such as herbicides which link to increased risk of leukemia's. Our proposed study directly addresses the needs for veterans who require leukemia treatment and blood reconstitution. Through comprehensive dissection of the regulatory roles of Tcf/Lef and /-catenin in HSCs we will acquire essential knowledge that helps improve the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation. By delving into the concept of using Tcf/Lef- and /-catenin-dependent transcriptional programs as druggable targets in LSCs we expect to devise novel therapies to treat CML and other hematological malignancies. These studies from both basic and translational fronts will help realize the promise of stem cells in regenerative medicine improvethe prognosis of hematological malignancies and enhance the healthcare for veterans.      ","Acute;Address;Adverse effects;Alprostadil;Animals;Blood;Bone Marrow Transplantation;Cell Nucleus;Chronic Myeloid Leukemia;Cytosol;Dinoprostone;Disease remission;Dissection;Environment;Environmental Risk Factor;Exposure to;FDA approved;Family;Financial compensation;Gene Expression;Genes;Genetic Transcription;Healthcare;Hematologic Neoplasms;Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation;Hematopoietic stem cells;Herbicides;Human;In Vitro;Intrinsic factor;Knowledge;Leukemic Cell;Leukemic Hematopoietic Stem Cell;Link;Maintenance;Molecular;Mouse Strains;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pre-Clinical Model;Production;Proteins;Radiation therapy;Regenerative Medicine;Relapse;Risk;Role;Stem Cell Leukemia;Stem cells;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Effect;Tumor Debulking;Veterans;Wnt proteins;Xenograft Model;base;beta catenin;chemotherapy;clinical practice;improved;in vivo;leukemia;leukemia treatment;member;mouse model;novel;novel therapeutics;outcome forecast;programs;public health relevance;reconstitution;regenerative therapy;self-renewal;small molecule;stem cell biology;therapeutic target;tool;transcription factor;transcriptome","Targeting Tcf/Lef-transcriptional program in leukemic stem cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:      Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the most widely deployed regenerative therapy and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for relapse of leukemia in patients after chemo- or radiotherapy-induced remission.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       This proposal aims to test two promising new treatments for diabetic neuropathy Ilepatril and LCZ696.   Each of these drugs acts through two mechanisms proposed to preserve peripheral nerves in diabetes: 1) to reduce the effect of angiotensin II on immune-mediated nerve damage and to reduce its effect on vessels supplying peripheral nerves acting to improve their blood supply and 2) to inhibit neutral endopeptidase which will make neuro- and vaso-active peptides more available at nerve endings to maintain vascular and nerve integrity and function. This proposal will also validate the use of corneal nerve morphology and sensory function as valid early small fiber markers of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The structure and function of corneal nerves are proposed as surrogates for detecting diabetic neuropathy early in humans and animal models and for use as outcome measures for the new treatments proposed.  Our long term objective is to conduct pre-clinical trials with the intent of identifying new effective treatments   for diabetic neuropathy and to advance this treatment to clinical trials using corneal nerve structure and   sensory function as outcome measures. Progress toward this goal has been hampered by the lack of a   sensitive and reliable method for diagnosing and monitoring peripheral neuropathy. Recently corneal confocal microscopy has shown promise as a non-invasive method for quantifying the damage and repair of corneal sensory nerves and to serve as a surrogate marker for diabetic neuropathy. Preliminary studies of corneal nerves in human diabetic patients have been promising but studies in animal models characterizing diabetic corneal nerve damage by monitoring their structure and sensory function over time have yet to be performed.      The immediate goals of this application are to examine the development progression and repair of corneal neuropathy in animal models of type 2 diabetes. This will be accomplished by investigating the structural integrity of corneal nerves using confocal microscopy and their function by using a Cochet-Bonnet filament esthesiometer. In addition to corneal sensation rate of tear production will also be monitored using Zone-Quick cotton threads (similar to a Schirmer's test in humans). Corneal structural and functional results will be compared to standard endpoints used to identify diabetic peripheral neuropathy including motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity thermal nociception and intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the hindpaw. After validating corneal nerves as a surrogate marker for diabetic neuropathy we will test the efficacy of two promising new treatment approaches on diabetes-induced corneal nerve damage and function. The treatment hypothesis to be examined is whether diabetic corneal nerve damage is caused to a large extent by modifiable factors targeted by treatment with Ilepatril and/or LCZ696.      The first phase of the study will address the hypothesis that type 2 diabetes causes an early and  progressive loss of corneal nerves reduces corneal sensitivity and decreases vascular relaxation in the   posterior ciliary artery which supplies the orbital portion of the trigeminal corneal nerves. It i hypothesized that corneal nerve damage and dysfunction will precede peripheral diabetic neuropathy. A longitudinal study in high fat fed/low dose streptozotocin diabetic rats an accepted model of type 2 diabetes will test this hypothesis. These studies will provide an understanding of the progression of diabetic nerve damage. The second phase of the study will address the hypothesis that corneal nerve fiber loss corneal dysfunction and impaired vascular reactivity of the posterior ciliary artery can be rescued by treating type 2 diabetic rats with Ilepatril and/or LCZ696. Results from these studies will determine whether prevention and intervention therapies can improve diabetes-induced corneal nerve impairment. These studies will provide a basis for the use of non-invasive assessment of structure and function of corneal nerves as a clinical tool for assessing diabetic peripheral neuropathy and its treatment in human clinical trials.","Address;Affect;Amputation;Angiotensin II;Angiotensin Receptor;Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors;Animal Model;Animals;Biological Preservation;Blood Vessels;Chronic;Clinical;Clinical Trials;Complication;Confocal Microscopy;Cornea;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Neuropathies;Diagnosis;Disease Progression;Dose;Early Diagnosis;Epidemic;Esthesia;Family;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fiber;Filament;Functional disorder;Goals;Gossypium;Healthcare Systems;Human;Image;Immune;Impairment;Inflammation;Longitudinal Studies;Measurement;Measures;Mediating;Methodology;Methods;Modality;Modeling;Monitor;Morphology;Motor;Neprilysin;Nerve;Nerve Endings;Nerve Fibers;Nerve Regeneration;Neural Conduction;Neuropathy;Nociception;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Outcome;Outcome Measure;Outcome Study;Oxidative Stress;Patients;Peptides;Peripheral;Peripheral Nerves;Peripheral Nervous System Diseases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Phenolsulfonphthalein;Population;Prevention therapy;Preventive Intervention;Production;Proprioception;Protease Inhibitor;Protocols documentation;Quality of life;Rehabilitation therapy;Relaxation;Research Design;Safety;Sensory;Skin;Skin Ulcer;Streptozocin;Structure;Surrogate Markers;Techniques;Testing;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Agents;Therapeutic Intervention;Time;Tissues;Translations;Treatment Protocols;Trigeminal System;Vascular blood supply;Veterans;Video Microscopy;afferent nerve;arteriole;autonomic nerve;base;ciliary artery;corneal repair;density;diabetic;diabetic patient;diabetic rat;early onset;effective therapy;efficacy testing;feeding;improved;injury and repair;mortality;nerve supply;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical trial;preclinical efficacy;preclinical study;prevent;targeted treatment;tool;treatment response;treatment strategy","Diabetic Neuropathy: Function-Structure of Corneal Nerves to Assess Injury-Repair","Type 2 diabetes is approaching epidemic levels and is creating a large burden on the financial capabilities of the VA health care system.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Almost 25% of the veterans that are currently receiving healthcare through the VA system carry the diagnosis of diabetes. Nearly all veterans with type 1 diabetes and >60% of veterans with type 2 develop retinopathy during the first two decades of disease 1% will experience severe visual loss or blindness. Current therapies provide clinically meaningful improvement in only 50% of veterans. Thus there is a critical need to identify regulators of DR which can be targeted therapeutically and will directly benefit a large group of veterans. We hypothesize that the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) under hyperglycemic conditions promotes the endothelial pathology characteristic for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in particular endothelial apoptosis and barrier dysfunction. Thus CaMKII inhibition may be a potent novel approach to prevent or treat DR. The long-term goal of the Grumbach lab is to study the function of CaMKII in the vasculature specifically CaMKII modulation as a new approach to treat vascular disease. The objective of this project is to determine whether specific CaMKII inhibition in endothelium prevents non-proliferative DR. The central hypothesis is that CaMKII inhibition decreases non-proliferative DR by preventing endothelial apoptosis and barrier dysfunction two key phenotypes of non-proliferative DR. We will test the hypothesis in a novel in vivo mouse model in which the potent and specific endogenous CaMKII inhibitor CaMKIIN is selectively overexpressed in endothelium and dissect molecular mechanisms in vitro. The rationale for the proposed studies is that understanding whether CaMKII regulates the phenotypic changes of non- proliferative DR in vivo and drives endothelial cells ROS-production apoptosis and barrier function may be a critical first step towards designing a specific CaMKII inhibitor to prevent and alleviate DR. We will test our central hypothesis in two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of endothelial CaMKII on non-proliferative DR in vivo 2): Characterize whether CaMKII controls endothelial dysfunction under high glucose conditions in vitro. In the first aim the novel in vivo model will be used to test whether CaMKII inhibition wil preserve retinal microvascular structure and function in non-proliferative DR. Under aim 2 we will define the mechanisms through which CaMKII is activated under hyperglycemia and regulates barrier function apoptosis and ROS production in vitro. The approach is innovative because of its use of novel in vivo models and imaging techniques and specific tools to dissect CaMKII signaling. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the field by defining CaMKII as a novel molecular target that controls endothelial phenotypes in DR. Ultimately such knowledge may allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies in DR that will benefits our veterans.      ","Accounting;Adult;Apoptosis;Background Diabetic Retinopathy;Basement membrane;Blindness;Blood Vessels;Blood capillaries;Calmodulin;Caring;Characteristics;Data;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Diabetic Retinopathy;Diagnosis;Disease;Disease Progression;Early Diagnosis;Early treatment;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Extravasation;Functional disorder;Glucose;Goals;Health Care Costs;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Human;Hyperglycemia;Imaging Techniques;In Vitro;Injury;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Knowledge;Mediating;Medical;Mission;Mitochondria;Molecular;Molecular Target;Outcome;Pathogenesis;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Permeability;Phenotype;Phosphotransferases;Play;Production;Publishing;Reactive Oxygen Species;Reporting;Research;Retinal;Retinal Diseases;Role;Signal Transduction;Staging;Steroids;Stress;Structure;System;Testing;Transgenic Mice;Validation;Vascular Diseases;Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors;Vascular Endothelium;Veterans;Work;aged;angiogenesis;base;burden of illness;capillary;design;endothelial dysfunction;experience;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;interest;laser photocoagulation;meetings;mitochondrial dysfunction;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;oxidation;prevent;public health relevance;research study;standard care;tool;treatment strategy","CaMKII as a regulator of diabetic retinopathy","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    About 25% of Veterans receiving medical care from VA facilities have diabetes.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disease involving death of upper and lower motor neurons controlling voluntary muscle movement. Current prevalence of ALS in the U.S. is estimated at 20000 with about 5000 new cases per year. Though people of all races and ethnicities are equally susceptible to ALS this disease strikes military veterans more frequently than the general population. Men are also more frequently affected than women. Although ALS is multi-factorial in origin disease progression and severity uniformly advance as motor neurons die. It is thus expected that neuroprotective agents that block motor neuron death might provide new therapeutic options for patients. However there are no drugs available that block neuronal cell death in ALS or any other form of neurodegeneration. Here we seek to improve the potency efficacy and safety of the P7C3-class of neuroprotective molecules that we have developed in hopes of addressing this unmet need. We have previously shown that P7C3-A20 a highly active analog of P7C3 delays motor neuron cell death and loss of motor function in G93A-SOD1 transgenic mice a preclinical model of ALS. We now propose to evaluate the efficacy of our most highly evolved analogue of P7C3 known as (-)-P7C3-S243 which has shown efficacy in rigorous preclinical models of Parkinson's disease and blast-mediated traumatic brain injury (TBI). Most notably axonal degeneration is a prominent feature of ALS and (-)-P7C3-S243 specifically blocks injury- induced axonal degeneration in the absence of neuron cell body death in this model of TBI. We have made substantial progress in medicinal chemistry and (-)-P7C3-S243 lacks the aniline moiety of the original P7C3 chemical and shows no overt toxicity including no inhibition of the human hERG channel. Furthermore prolonged administration of (-)-P7C3-S243 is well tolerated in rodents at doses 10- to 30-fold higher than required for therapeutic efficacy. Importantly we have also recently identified the molecular target of the P7C3 molecules as nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). NAMPT catalyzes the rate-limiting step in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) salvage and active analogues of P7C3 enhance its conversion of nicotinamide into nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and NAD in living cells. Strong historical evidence has long predicted that drugs capable of enhancing NAD levels should be uniquely beneficial in treatment of neurodegenerative disease. In addition to mechanistic insight knowing the molecular target of P7C3 enables us to explore wider swaths of chemistry than previously allowed. Efficacy of new molecules will first be evaluated by in vitro assays of activity and successful leads will then be evaluated for in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. Molecules passing these criteria will be subsequently evaluated in in vivo assays of hippocampal neuroprotection our original screening platform that identified the P7C3 molecule. Finally molecules that perform as well or better than our current most promising leads will then be subjected to rigorous testing in two animal models of ALS (G93A-SOD1 mice and ChAT-tTA-9/TDP-43M337V rats) with outcome measures encompassing both motor function and neuronal survival. Protective efficacy in these models will be correlated with CNS levels of the compounds in brain and spinal cord. Our goal is to advance our science from a pre-clinical setting towards first-in-human clinical testing of a neuroprotective drug for ALS.","Address;Adenine;Affect;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis;Aniline;Animal Model;Biochemical;Biological Assay;Biological Availability;Blast Cell;Blood;Brain;Carbazoles;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Chemicals;Chemistry;Collaborations;Development;Disease;Disease Progression;Dose;Doxorubicin;Drug Kinetics;Drug toxicity;Employee Strikes;Enzyme Activators;Enzymes;Ethnic Origin;General Population;Genetic study;Goals;Health;Hippocampus (Brain);Human;In Vitro;Injury;Laboratories;Lead;Life;Mediating;Medical center;Military Personnel;Modeling;Molecular Target;Motor;Motor Neurons;Movement;Mus;Mutant Strains Mice;Nerve Degeneration;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Neuroprotective Agents;Niacinamide;Nicotinamide Mononucleotide;Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;Oral;Outcome Measure;Parkinson Disease;Patients;Pharmaceutical Chemistry;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pre-Clinical Model;Prevalence;Process;Property;Race;Rattus;Research;Resources;Rodent;Rodent Model;Safety;Science;Series;Severity of illness;Skeletal Muscle;Solubility;Spinal Cord;Staging;System;Testing;Texas;Toxic effect;Toxicology;Transgenic Animals;Transgenic Mice;Traumatic Brain Injury;Treatment Efficacy;Universities;Variant;Veterans;Woman;analog;axonal degeneration;base;design;drug efficacy;efficacy testing;improved;in vitro Assay;in vitro testing;in vivo;insight;meetings;member;men;mutant;neuron loss;neuronal survival;neuroprotection;nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase;novel;novel therapeutics;pre-clinical;professor;protective efficacy;research clinical testing;scaffold;screening;small molecule","Neuroprotective Small Molecules as Novel Treatments for ALS","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and rapidly fatal form of neurodegenerative disease that strikes military veterans more frequently than the general population.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness and visual disability that has a major impact on the quality of life and productivity of Americans including approximately 285000 Veterans. With no new pharmaceutical classes for treating glaucoma introduced into clinical practice since the 1990s there remains a continuing need for improved regimes that treat glaucoma more effectively. Our long-term goal is to contribute to the development of these improved therapies that make the disease less debilitating. Here we focus on a novel treatment strategy aimed at preventing nocturnal rises in intraocular pressure (IOP). Elevated IOP is a cardinal risk factor leading to glaucoma. Every night in people with and without glaucoma IOP rises. In patients with glaucoma these nocturnal rises in IOP are suspected of having particular importance in promoting disease progression. The objective of this proposal is to identify pharmacologically targetable molecules contributing to nocturnal rises in IOP. Our central hypothesis is that casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a key participant in physiologic IOP regulation whose inhibition will prevent nocturnal rises in IOP and suppress glaucoma. We have generated this hypothesis and our experiments to test it based on our Preliminary Data identifying a mutation in mice that is capable of preventing a nocturnal rise in IOP and that rescues glaucoma. Subsequent experiments have led us to suspect that CK2 is central to these phenomena including Preliminary Data that a pharmacological inhibitor of CK2 prevents nocturnal rises in IOP. To substantiate this finding our current experiments utilize physiologic assays of aqueous humor dynamics in mice and human tissues to delineate the mechanisms by which CK2 influences IOP and to establish if the same pathways are also active in human eyes. The design of the experiments makes use of several unique animal resources including carefully controlled genetic backgrounds targeted disruptions to CK2 and a new model of glaucoma based on transgenic expression of a glaucoma-causing mutation in the human myocilin gene. Complementing these experiments in mice the design also incorporates studies of aqueous humor dynamics with human tissue. To test our hypothesis and achieve our objective we propose: (Specific Aim 1) Determine the influence of CK2 inhibition on mouse ocular tissues and (Specific Aim 2) Determine the influence of CK2 inhibition on human ocular tissues. Upon completion of these studies we expect to have determined if modulation of CK2 is an effective approach that could be used to treat patients with glaucoma.","Affect;American;Aqueous Humor;Binding Proteins;Biological Assay;Blindness;CHS1 gene;Clinical Trials;Complement;Data;Development;Disease;Disease Management;Disease Progression;Epithelial Cells;Ethnic Origin;Eye;Eye diseases;Future;Genes;Genetic;Glaucoma;Goals;Health;Hour;Human;Investigational New Drug Application;Lead;Light;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Organ Culture Techniques;Outcome;Participant;Pathway interactions;Patient-Focused Outcomes;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacologic Substance;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Physiological;Production;Productivity;Quality of life;Regulation;Risk Factors;Role;Services;Testing;Tissues;Toxic effect;Transgenic Organisms;Translating;United States;Veterans;Visual;Wild Type Mouse;Work;animal data;animal resource;base;casein kinase II;clinical practice;design;disability;genetic manipulation;human tissue;improved;inhibitor/antagonist;myocilin;novel;pre-clinical;prevent;research study;treatment strategy","Therapy of Nocturnal Intraocular Pressure Elevation Causing Glaucoma Progression","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Glaucoma is a potentially blinding eye disease affecting approximately 2.2 million Americans including 285000 Veterans.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The peripheral visual field is largely unexplored to our current method of clinical testing staticthreshold automated perimetry. Until the advent of computerized perimetry (quantitation of the visual field) 35 years ago clinical practice was to test the full visual field manually by kinetic(moving target) Goldmann perimetry. With the evolution to computerized static perimetry the focus shifted to the central 30. This seldom tested area outside the central visual field represents over 3 times the territory currently evaluated. This is important because the peripheral field is critical for navigation of the environment (functional vision) can be the earlest site of visual field defects may be the most appropriate territory to follow patients needing changes in intervention and gives a more detailed and full evaluation of vision.  Our pilot data shows that advances in knowledge from our past Merit Reviews coupled with new methodology will now allow us to develop testing of the full visual field using static stimuli in a time-efficint precise and accurate way. This will give a comprehensive assessment of the visual field.  Main Hypothesis: Using larger perimetric stimuli in the peripheral visual field along with a Bayesian testing strategy will allow an efficient accurate and precise perimetry method so that testing of the full visual field is practical and produces an improved assessment of vision.  Specific Aim 1. Characterize the location of far peripheral visual field defects of optic neuropathies to static stimuli. We will test the full visual field in 120 stable glaucoma and idiopathic intracranial hypertension subjects with a broad range of optic nerve damage to determine where defects occur in the far peripheral visual field to static automated testing. Specific Aim 2. Develop a Bayesian strategy to test the full visual field in less than 10 minutes per eye. We will develop a pattern of test locations in the central and peripheral field based on where visual field defects most often occur. By only using stimulus sizes and intensities that give excellent repeatability aBayesian test strategy and results from frequency of seeing curves we will develop a new perimetry test. Specific Aim 3. Validate the full visual field testing using the new Bayesian strategy perimetry test. Sixty healthy observers will be tested twice and normative limits for the new test calculated. The 120 optic neuropathy subjects will be retested and the results compared. Specific Aim 4. Correlation of structure of the retinal nerve fiber layer and function (perimetry) using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with the full visual field will provide stronger correlations than only the central visual field.  We expect to find visual field defects i the peripheral visual field in cases where central visual field testing is normal and develop a tes that will give a better assessment of visual function. This will allow more accurate results leadin to earlier detection of diseases like glaucoma earlier disease intervention and better structure /function correlations. Improved test precision will lead to lower retest variability and earlier detection of visual field change. Also with cases of moderate to severe visual loss evaluation ofthe full visual field will provide a larger area to monitor for changes in vision. Lastly using lager stimuli will lead to almost a doubling of the effective dynamic range of the test that will lead tobetter assessment of veterans with poor vision. These test attributes should allow improved functional visual assessment for veterans with glaucoma and other optic neuropathies and improved outcome measures for VA rehabilitation research protocols.      ","Agreement;Algorithms;Area;Blindness;Coupled;Data;Defect;Disease;Early Diagnosis;Early Intervention;Environment;Evaluation;Evolution;Eye;Frequencies;Glaucoma;Hour;Intervention;Investigation;Kinetics;Knowledge;Lead;Location;Methodology;Methods;Monitor;Octopus;Optic Nerve;Optical Coherence Tomography;Outcome Measure;Papilledema;Patients;Pattern;Performance;Perimetry;Peripheral;Physiologic Intraocular Pressure;Positioning Attribute;Process;Protocols documentation;Pseudotumor Cerebri;Rehabilitation Research;Research;Running;Scotoma;Site;Stimulus;Structure;Suspect Glaucomas;Techniques;Test Result;Testing;Time;United States National Institutes of Health;Veterans;Vision;Visual;Visual Fields;advanced disease;base;central visual field;clinical practice;computerized;field study;improved;improved outcome;optic nerve disorder;programs;public health relevance;research clinical testing;retinal nerve fiber layer","Testing of the Peripheral Visual Field - Obtaining the Full View","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Testing the full visual field in a more accurate precise and efficient way will lead to 1) earlierdiagnosis and 2) earlier detection of visual field change allowing more timely intervention; 3) a more comprehensive evaluation of functional vision and 4) better correlation of change in optic nerve structural damage with visual field performance.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Tularemia is a potentially fatal zoonosis of humans caused by the facultative intracellular bacterium Francisella tularensis and inhalation of as few as ten organisms is sufficient to cause severe pneumonic disease tissue necrosis and death. Accumulation of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMNs) in the lungs is essential for development of severe disease in animals infected with this pathogen and tissue destruction progresses steadily as more alveoli and bronchioles become clogged with infected PMNs and debris. Direct evidence that neutrophils contribute to tularemia progression and pathogenesis rather than effective host defense is demonstrated by the fact that blockade of PMN influx into the lung is protective and animals survive what would otherwise be a lethal infection. Nevertheless most studies of F. tularensis have focused on the fate of this organism in macrophages. Our long-term goal is to define in detail the role of human neutrophils in the pathogenesis of tularemia. To this end we have made several important discoveries. We have shown that natural IgM is required for opsonization of F. tularensis and identified receptors that mediate infection of both neutrophils and macrophages. We discovered that evasion of oxidative host defense is achieved via the ability of F. tularensis to act at multiple levels to disrupt NADPH oxidase assembly and activity and identified relevant virulence factors. We were also the first to show that F. tularensis can escape the phagosome and replicate in neutrophil cytosol confirming its ability to successfully infect multiple phagocytes types. Particularly relevant here is our discovery of PMN-specific aspects of virulence. Neutrophils are short-lived cells that are preprogrammed to die by constitutive apoptosis a process that is typically accelerated by phagocytosis and is essential for resolution of the inflammatory response. In marked contrast we find that F. tularensis inhibits PMN apoptosis and significantly prolongs cell lifespan and this is achieved in part viaeffects on neutrophil gene expression. These data are noteworthy as defects in PMN turnover are indicative of an ineffective and dysregulated inflammatory response. Timely clearance of dying PMNs by macrophages is essential to prevent necrosis and tissue damage and our preliminary data suggest that this process may also be impaired. In view of these data we hypothesize that F. tularensis inhibits PMN apoptosis by affecting expression of a specific subset of anti- and proapoptotic genes and pro-survival factors and that defects in clearance of infected PMNs by macrophages favors cell necrosis sustains infection and prevents the reprogramming of macrophages that is required for termination of the inflammatory response.

To identify bacterial genes required for PMN apoptosis inhibition. 3. To elucidate the functional consequences of prolonged neutrophil lifespan. We expect that completion of the proposed studies will provide fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms that account for the dysregulated inflammatory response that is characteristic of tularemia and that our findings will also inform studies of other diseases that are also characterized by defects in PMN turnover and affect Veterans more frequently such as chromic obstructive pulmonary disease.","Accounting;Acute;Affect;Alveolus;Animals;Apoptosis;Apoptotic;BAX gene;BIRC4 gene;Bacteria;Bacterial Genes;Biological Warfare;Breathing;Bronchioles;Calpain;Caspase;Cells;Cessation of life;Characteristics;Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease;Cytosol;Data;Defect;Development;Disease;Down-Regulation;Event;Francisella tularensis;Gene Expression;Genes;Goals;Granuloma;Health;Host Defense;Human;Immune;Immunoglobulin M;Infection;Infection prevention;Inflammatory Response;Inhibition of Apoptosis;Leukocytes;Libraries;Life;Longevity;Lung;Lung diseases;Macaca mulatta;Manuscripts;Mediating;Microbe;Mitochondria;Molecular;Molecular Mechanisms of Action;Mus;NADPH Oxidase;Necrosis;Organism;Oryctolagus cuniculus;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phagocytes;Phagocytosis;Phagosomes;Play;Pneumonia;Process;Rattus;Regulation;Resolution;Role;Surface;Symptoms;Testing;Therapeutic;Tissues;Tularemia;Veterans;Virulence;Virulence Factors;Virulent;Zoonoses;antimicrobial;calpastatin;insight;interest;macrophage;microbicide;mutant;neutrophil;particle;pathogen;prevent;programs;receptor;screening;transcriptome","Dysregulation of the inflammatory response by Francisella tularensis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       The high microbicidal capacity and short lifespan of neutrophils are critical for effective antimicrobial defense and regulation of the inflammatory response.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Because it is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and stroke and a leading cause of cognitive decline hypertension has an enormous negative impact on the brain. End-organ damage to endothelium underlies many forms of cerebrovascular disease with diverse consequences. The renin-angiotensin sys- tem (RAS) and angiotensin II (Ang II) play a fundamental role during hypertension and in the pathogenesis of vascular disease. Detrimental effects of the RAS are commonly due to Ang II acting on AT1 receptors resulting in activation of many downstream targets and oxidative stress. A major barrier to progress for preventing cerebrovascular disease has been our limited understanding of endogenous molecules and pathways that may effectively suppress these processes. Our pilot data suggest the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR) has a major influence on the cerebral circulation with links to the RAS. Using novel mouse models to define cell-specific mechanisms our overall goal is to determine if endothelial PPAR protects the vasculature in Ang II-dependent models of disease and to define targets or pathways that mediate these effects. To define the role of PPAR in this cell type we will examine the hypothesis that interference with endothelial PPAR augments Ang-II induced vascular dysfunction and abnormal vascular growth (Aim 1). As part of this Aim we will also determine if increased expression of wild-type PPAR in endothelium protects against detrimental structural and functional effects. Our preliminary data suggest genetic interference with endothelial PPAR increases expression of NADPH oxidase and augments Ang II-induced vascular dysfunction while increased endothelial expression of wild- type PPAR inhibits vascular effects of Ang II. In contrast to Ang II the RAS can exert beneficial effects via the actions of Ang (1-7). Aim 2 will unravel a previously unknown interaction and determine if Ang (1-7) and its receptor are targets of endothelial PPAR. We will determine if interference with endothelial PPAR impairs vascular effects of the Ang (1-7) arm of the RAS and define mechanisms involved. Our preliminary data support this hypothesis. We suggest PPAR and select targets in endothelium are part of a previously unrecognized mechanism that suppresses detrimental effects of Ang II. The balance between PPAR and the RAS (and their respective targets) in endothelium may be a major determinant of the onset and pro- gression of carotid and cerebrovascular disease. Defining key connections between PPAR and the RAS may ultimately lead to more specific therapeutic targeting for vascular disease that leads to stroke and/or contributes to the vascular component of Alzheimers disease and hypertension-induced cognitive impairment.","Adult;Affect;Aging;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;Angiotensin II;Angiotensins;Atherosclerosis;Biology;Blood - brain barrier anatomy;Blood Vessels;Brain;Brain Injuries;Carotid Arteries;Cells;Cerebrovascular Circulation;Cerebrovascular Disorders;Cerebrovascular system;Cerebrum;Data;Dementia;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Disease model;Elements;Endothelial Cells;Endothelium;Equilibrium;Etiology;Genetic;Genetic Models;Goals;Growth;Health;Hypertension;Impaired cognition;Lead;Ligands;Link;Mediating;Microcirculation;Modeling;NADPH Oxidase;Organ;Oxidative Stress;PPAR gamma;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A;Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors;Play;Population;Process;Regulation;Renin-Angiotensin System;Research Personnel;Risk Factors;Role;Site;Structure;Testing;Therapeutic;Thrombosis;Vascular Diseases;Vascular remodeling;Vasoconstrictor Agents;Veterans;Western World;activating transcription factor;arm;base;cardiovascular risk factor;cell type;endothelial dysfunction;genetic approach;improved;innovation;insight;mouse model;new therapeutic target;novel;prevent;receptor;response;stroke;stroke recovery;therapeutic target;transcription factor;vascular bed","Role of PPAR-gamma in Cerebral Endothelium","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Hypertension is a major health problem affecting approximately one-third of the adult US population including veterans.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Age-related skeletal muscle atrophy also known as sarcopenia diminishes the health and quality of life of many Veteran patients. However the molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy are poorly understood and a pharmacologic therapy does not exist. As a result many elderly Veterans suffer the consequences of muscle atrophy including weakness falls debilitation and loss of independence. This places enormous burdens on elderly Veterans their families and society in general. Our long-term goal is to understand molecular mechanisms of age-related muscle atrophy and then use that information to develop a therapy. In the previous grant cycle we discovered Gadd45a and p21 as critical mediators of a novel molecular pathway to skeletal muscle atrophy. Aging as well as other causes of muscle atrophy strongly induce Gadd45a mRNA in skeletal muscle of humans mice and rats. This increases the level of Gadd45a protein which in turn increases p21 mRNA. As a result the level of p21 protein rises and triggers many of the critical changes that occur during age-related skeletal muscle atrophy including loss of protein and mitochondria and ultimately muscle fiber atrophy. Collectively these results strongly suggest a key role for the Gadd45a/p21 pathway in age-related muscle atrophy. However these data also elucidate several important areas for further investigation. For example our data indicate that the sequential induction of Gadd45a and p21 plays a central role in skeletal muscle atrophy; but we do not yet know how aging increases skeletal muscle Gadd45a expression or how Gadd45a increases p21 expression. In addition our data suggest the Gadd45a/p21 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in age-related skeletal muscle atrophy; but this hypothesis has not yet been tested. To resolve these important issues we propose three specific aims all using mouse models. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that two transcription factors (p53 and ATF4) are responsible for increasing Gadd45a mRNAs during skeletal muscle aging. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that two Gadd45a-interacting proteins (MEKK4 and LRRC14) play key roles in Gadd45a-mediated p21 expression. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that reducing Gadd45a and/or p21 permits recovery of skeletal muscle mitochondria and muscle fiber size in aged atrophic muscle. Through these studies we hope to elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches for age-related muscle atrophy a disabling condition that affects many Veteran patients.","Affect;Aging;Area;Atrophic;CDKN1A gene;Data;Elderly;Family;Fracture;Goals;Grant;Health;Human;Independent Living;Investigation;Knockout Mice;MAP3K4 gene;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Medicine;Messenger RNA;Mitochondria;Molecular;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Fibers;Muscle Mitochondria;Muscular Atrophy;Pathway interactions;Patients;Play;Protein Kinase;Proteins;Proteomics;Quality of life;Rat-1;Rattus;Recovery;Research;Role;Skeletal Muscle;Societies;TP53 gene;Testing;Veterans;age related;age-related muscle loss;aged;base;cell type;falls;mouse model;muscle aging;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;sarcopenia;skeletal muscle wasting;therapeutic target;transcription factor","Molecular Mechanisms of Age-related Muscle Loss","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Muscle wasting also known as skeletal muscle atrophy is a very common problem in elderly Veteran patients and leads to other problems such as weakness reduced activity falls fractures loss of independent living and reduced quality of life.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        The alarming increase in overweight and obese individuals in the US is a major healthcare issue since it contributes to higher rates of type 2 diabetes vascular disease and cardiovascular events. Because dietary saturated fatty acids have been linked to vascular dysfunction and insulin resistance (a prelude to type 2 diabetes) dietary fatty acid manipulation may be an important target for preventing or reversing vascular abnormalities associated with obesity. The focus of this proposal is to address the mechanisms underlying dietary fatty acid-induced vascular dysfunction. We hypothesize two potential mechanisms:  high saturated fat diets may produce abnormal membrane lipid composition which 1) affects formation of specialized membrane compartments (lipid rafts) and activation of signaling molecules or 2) promotes unique sphingolipid signaling pathways within vascular tissue. These abnormal membrane effects of saturated fatty acids may be reversed by enriching the diet with monounsaturated (MUFAs) or polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. To test our hypothesis we will use a mouse model of high saturated fat-induced obesity and manipulate dietary fat composition to address the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1:  To determine whether replacement of a portion of dietary saturated fats with MUFA or n-3 PUFAs restores vascular function to normal by modifying caveolar versus non-caveolar localization of key signaling molecules. Our working hypothesis is that diets enriched in MUFAs and n-3 PUFAs target endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and/or cyclooxygenase (Cox) to membrane lipid rafts differently than a high saturated fat diet by altering membrane composition. This shift in localization defines their activation and vascular function. We will measure responses of small gracilis arteries and aorta from mice on diets enriched in saturated fats MUFA enriched olive oil or n-3 PUFA enriched menhaden oil in conjunction with membrane fatty acid composition and localization of eNOS and Cox within lipid rafts. We will compare the effects of diet on vascular function with localization of signaling pathways using wild type and caveolin-1 (cav-1) deficient mice devoid of vascular caveolae to separate effects on caveolar versus non-caveolar lipid rafts. Aim 2:  To determine whether dietary fatty acid saturation affects sphingolipid signaling pathways- specifically sphingosine kinase and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)- to modify vascular function. Our working hypothesis is that dietary fatty acids promote signaling through formation of unique sphingolipid-based proteins that impact vascular function. We will measure responses of small gracilis arteries and aorta from mice on diets enriched in saturated fats MUFAs or n-3 PUFAs in conjunction with levels of sphingosine kinase and S1P within vascular tissue. We will assess the effects of dietary fatty acids on sphingosine kinase by comparing expression levels and using pharmacological inhibitors and genetically modified mice. High fat feeding of mice is a relevant model for study of vascular complications of diet since mice become obese develop insulin resistance and abnormal glucose tolerance similar to type 2 diabetics. High fat diets are the greatest cause of obesity in people. These studies are innovative in directly testing the mechanisms involved in effects of dietary fats on vascular function using a mouse model of obesity:  abnormal membrane composition and localization of signaling proteins within specific lipid rafts or fatty acid-dependent signaling pathways. The studies are significant because dietary fats are a known therapeutic target but the optimal diet composition for reversing the progression of cardiovascular disease and the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined.","Address;Affect;Animal Model;Aorta;Arteries;Blood Pressure;Blood Vessels;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cardiovascular system;Caveolae;Cell membrane;Data;Diet;Dietary Fats;Dietary Fatty Acid;Event;Fat Substitutes;Fatty Acids;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Fish Oils;Goals;Guidelines;Health;Healthcare;High Fat Diet;Individual;Insulin Resistance;Link;Lipids;Measures;Mediating;Membrane;Membrane Lipids;Membrane Microdomains;Menhaden oil;Modeling;Mono-S;Mus;N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid;NOS3 gene;Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Obesity;Olive oil preparation;Overweight;Phospholipids;Population;Production;Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase;Proteins;Research;Saturated Fatty Acids;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Signaling Molecule;Signaling Protein;Sphingolipids;Study models;Testing;Tissues;Unsaturated Fats;Vascular Diseases;Veterans;Work;base;caveolin 1;diabetic;dihydroceramide desaturase;feeding;glucose tolerance;indexing;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;insulin signaling;lard;mouse model;polyunsaturated fat;prevent;response;saturated fat;sphingosine 1-phosphate;sphingosine kinase;therapeutic target;vascular abnormality","Effect of dietary fat on diet-induced insulin resistance and vascular dysfunction","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:        The alarming percentage of overweight and obese veterans and individuals in the US is a major healthcare issue since it contributes to higher rates of type 2 diabetes vascular disease and cardiovascular events.

"No NIH Category available","American military veterans commonly develop unremitting pulmonary diseases in which the alveolicomprising the gas-exchange region are destroyed leading to frequent hospitalizations. Reductions incigarette smoking have not been accompanied by reductions in health care costs and deaths related to thesediseases highlighting the need for treatments to allay further destruction and repair damaged alveoli. Todevelop such treatments it is important to identify factors which are active during development and could bemanipulated to repair alveoli in adults. The applicant has concentrated on interstitial lung fibroblasts (LF)during alveolar formation and now proposes investigations to elucidate how LF are directed to move away fromtheir initial locus at eruptions from the primary septa into the airspace during secondary septation.Hypothesis: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRa) and sonic hedgehog (Shh)cooperatively regulate secondary alveolar septal elongation by fostering fibroblast polarization and directionalmigration. Specific Aim 1: To investigate how lung fibroblasts orient along the axis of the secondary septalelongation (polarize) and how polarization is influenced by PDGFRa and Shh. Specific Aim 2: To localizeshared signaling molecules in the PDGF-A and Shh intracellular signaling pathways during LF migration invitro and define the topography of their activation in relationship to the primary cilium centriole andremodeling microtubules. Preliminary studies have shown that LF expressing PDGFRa preferentially localizetowards the most distal portions of the alveolar septum more abundantly display primary cilia and orient theircentrioles towards the alveolar entry ring (AER). PDGFRa regulates Akt enhances proliferation and reducesapoptosis in LF which express this receptor. Shh signals through a non-canonical pathway involving the G-protein coupled receptor properties of Smoothened. PDGF-A and Shh cooperatively enhance directionalmigration of LF and share important signaling intermediates that modify microtubules (MT) and direct cell-polarity. Studies are proposed to accomplish these objectives including stereological analysis of lungs frommice in which one allele of the endogenous PDGFRa-promoter regulatory region drives expression of a greenfluorescent protein (GFP) tag. This will enable localization and enumeration of this LF-population andrecognition of how the polarity of these cells differs from other alveolar cells with respect to PDGF-A and Shhsignaling. PDGF-A and Shh signaling will be perturbed using conditional deletions of PDGFRa orsmoothened or by inhibiting PDGFRa-kinase activity. Such perturbations will identify how these pathwaysensure adequate and directed movement of LF through regulation of their polarity during migration. Live celltime-lapse imaging will be used to quantify the speed and persistence of LF migration in microfluidic devices inorder to learn how these parameters are modified by PDGF-A Shh and alterations in cell shape. Signalingevents and MT-remodeling will be localized using immunofluorescence microscopy: both throughimmunohistochemistry and by tracking fluorescently labeled proteins expressed by a LF-cell line. Attention willbe focused on pathways (phosphoinositol 3-kinase PI3K and Akt/protein kinase-B) which maintain polarity byregulating microtubule stabilization at the leading edge. These proposed studies will illuminate how LF reachtheir optimal locations and persistently migrate along a properly oriented axis of alveolar septal elongation.Knowing how LF are directed to their optimal location may facilitate understanding how elastic fibers aredeposited in a mechanically optimized pattern. Information from the proposed studies will also serve as abasis for future studies of how mechanical strain induced by respiration impacts LF positioning.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Obesity is a major worldwide health problem and highly prevalent among our veteran population. Therapeutic options are limited. Lifestyle change is effective but difficult to implement and available drugs are minimally effective and/or unsafe. Surgical therapy can be effective but requires a major operation and is associated with several long-term complications.  In spite of the problems with drug therapy to date we believe there is an intriguing approach that needs further evaluation. That approach is to target mitochondria with agents that induce mild respiratory uncoupling. As discussed in the body of this application mitochondrial uncoupling has the potential to divert caloric intake to heat production rather to energy storage as fat mass. Although vigorous uncoupling is likely dangerous mild uncoupling (over time) could lead to safe weight loss in a manner that has been likened to exercise.  Coenzyme Q (CoQ) has been advocated as an antioxidant and metabolically active compound offering health benefits. However CoQ does not or very poorly penetrates mitochondrial membranes and has not proven effective. Therefore attempts have been made to target CoQ to mitochondria. A common approach is to shorten the CoQ side chain and add a covalent attachment consisting of the positively charged cation triphenylphosphonium (TPP). This has led to compounds we refer to as mitochondrial-targeted CoQ analogs (MTQAs). The prototype is the compound mitoquinone (MitoQ) which has been developed as a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant and is now under investigation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases aging hepatic steatosis and other disorders.  In recent VA supported work my laboratory has found prominent metabolic effects of MTQAs. This does not seem surprising given the mitochondrial targeting. However to date there has been relatively little interest in examining these metaboliceffects as applicable for therapeutic purposes. In preliminary and published work to date we found that MTQAs manifest dose-dependent effects to induce mitochondrial respiratory uncoupling in cultured cells. Moreover we have preliminary evidence that they are effective in preventing obesity in mice. Somewhat surprisingly we have data suggesting that this occurs not only through enhanced energy expenditure but also by inhibiting energy intake at the level of the central nervous system. This has led us to an overall hypothesis that a MTQA compound acting at the mitochondrial level can prevent obesity with minimal toxicity and ultimately provesufficient for clinical use. Briefly stated the three specific aims of this application are: 1. Examine the effects of selected MTQA compounds for therapeutic potential based on metabolic studies in cultured cells. We propose to examine MitoQ SKQ1 and compounds representing MitoQ and SKQ1 but with two side chain modifications for each parent compound (six compounds total). 2. Evaluate 2-3 selected compounds for their actions in a rodent model of obesity with attention to effects on energy expenditure and energy intake. 3. Select 1-2 compounds for more detailed mechanistic study directed at understanding the in vivo effects observed in aim 2. Significance and Innovation: The clinical importance of obesity among veterans is obvious. Our approach to addressing this issue is innovative. As will become clear we will apply new and innovative methodology to look for previously unidentified mechanisms underlying the effects of MTQAs. We point out that we have no interest in the commercial development of MTQAs and therefore no bias towards any one particular compound. Our interest is in the scientific aspects of mild uncoupling as a possible treatment for obesity.","Accounting;Address;Adipocytes;Adult;Advocate;Aging;Anti-Obesity Agents;Antioxidants;Attention;Bioenergetics;Biological Assay;Body Weight decreased;Body mass index;Brown Fat;Calories;Cations;Cell Culture Techniques;Cells;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.);Characteristics;Charge;Chemicals;Clinical;Cultured Cells;Data;Development;Disease;Dose;Eating;Energy Intake;Energy Metabolism;Epidemic;Equilibrium;Evaluation;Exercise;Fatty Liver;Fatty acid glycerol esters;Gene Expression;Glycogen Branching Enzyme;Health;Health Benefit;Hypothalamic structure;Investigation;Laboratories;Lead;Life Style;Limb structure;Lipid Peroxidation;Literature;Liver;Measures;Metabolic;Methodology;Methods;Mitochondria;Modification;Monitor;Mus;Muscle;Muscle Cells;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neurons;Obesity;Operative Surgical Procedures;Output;Overweight;Oxidation-Reduction;Oxygen Consumption;Parents;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Plasma;Population;Predisposition;Prevalence;Prevention;Production;Protons;Publishing;Rodent;Rodent Model;Side;Signal Transduction;Superoxides;Therapeutic;Thermogenesis;Time;Tissues;Toxic effect;Ubiquinone;Urine;Veterans;Water consumption;Weight Gain;Work;analog;base;energy balance;feeding;improved;in vivo;innovation;interest;metabolic abnormality assessment;mitochondrial membrane;mitochondrial permeability transition pore;mitoquinone;novel;obesity treatment;operation;prevent;prototype;respiratory;response","Mitochondrial-targeted CoQ analogs: Bioenergetic Effects in Obesity","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:        The proposed work will evaluate certain chemical derivatives of natural Co-enzyme Q that are active within mitochondria to enhance energy expenditure and/or decrease energy intake.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The function of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) remains poorly understood in the vasculature. Our data suggest that CaMKII is instrumental in mediating blood pressure increases in Angiotensin-II (Ang-II) hypertension. Thus CaMKII inhibition may be a potent novel approach to treat high blood pressure. Almost 50% of the veterans that are currently receiving health care through the VA carry the diagnosis of hypertension. The average treatment cost associated with this diagnosis has been estimated at $6000 per veteran annually. Nonetheless about 30% of veterans with hypertension currently do not reach the target blood pressure (BP). Our long-term goal is to help develop selective CaMKII inhibitors that can be used clinically for the treatment of hypertension. As a next step toward this goal theobjective of this application is to delineate the function of CaMKII in established models of hypertension. The central hypothesis is that CaMKII activity in vascular smooth muscle cells regulates vascular tone by increasing intracellular Ca2+ and thereby BP. Our hypothesis is based on strong preliminary data obtained in our novel in vivo mouse model in which the potent and specific endogenous CaMKII inhibitor CaMKIIN is selectively overexpressed in smooth muscle cells. Our Tg SM HA-CaMKIIN mice exhibit significantly decreased blood pressure in Ang-II-induced hypertension. The rationale for the proposed studies is that once we understand how CaMKII regulates intracellular Ca2+ and thereby affects vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and blood pressure we will have made a critical first step towards assessing its potential as a new molecular target for the development of drugs to treat hypertension. Guided by strong preliminary data the central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) Identifythe effect that CaMKII inhibition in vascular smooth muscle cells has on blood pressure in established models of hypertension 2): Identify how CaMKII controls the intracellular Ca2+ load of vascular smooth muscle cells. In the first aim the novel in vivo model will be used to test whether CaMKII activation is a common pathway in three blood pressure models and if CaMKII inhibition is sufficient to abrogate the BP increases. Under aim 2 we will define the mechanisms through which CaMKII controls intracellular intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle cells. The approach is innovative because of its use of novel in vivo models and specific tools to dissect CaMKII signaling. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance the field by defining CaMKII as a novel molecular target that controls intracellular Ca2+ and vascular tone. Ultimately such knowledge may allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies in hypertension that will benefit our veterans.","Affect;Angiotensin II;Antihypertensive Agents;Blood Pressure;Blood Vessels;Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase;Calcium;Calmodulin;Carotid Arteries;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Diastolic blood pressure;Drug Targeting;Endothelin-1;Exhibits;Goals;Health;Health Care Costs;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Homeostasis;Hypertension;Hypotension;Knowledge;Lead;Light;Mediating;Modeling;Molecular;Molecular Target;Mus;Muscle Contraction;Outcome;Pathway interactions;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phosphotransferases;Preparation;Publishing;Regulation;Reporting;Research;Rodent Model;Sarcoplasmic Reticulum;Signal Transduction;Site;Smooth Muscle Myocytes;Testing;Tissues;Treatment Cost;Validation;Vascular Smooth Muscle;Vasoconstrictor Agents;Veterans;Work;base;blood pressure reduction;blood pressure regulation;burden of illness;drug development;expectation;hypertension treatment;in vivo;in vivo Model;inhibitor/antagonist;innovation;mouse model;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutic intervention;overexpression;tool;treatment strategy;uptake;vasoconstriction","Calmodulin kinase II inhibition as novel molecular treatment of hypertension","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       More than 1.6 million veterans were treated for hypertension in 2002.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatitis C (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis and considerable morbidity worldwide. Current therapy for chronic HCV infection is alpha-interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) for 24-48 weeks together with an approved protease inhibitor depending on HCV genotype. Unfortunately about half of all treated patients fail to achieve sustained viral eradication after therapy. Intense research has focused on development of new direct-acting anti-HCV drugs to supplement and improve present therapy. Although the first generation of HCV protease inhibitors is a noticeable step forward it is imperative that we continue to pursue new more effective antivirals agents. Recent findings from our group and others indicate that precursors and products of heme metabolism are direct acting antiviral agents. Metalloporphyrins (MPs) such as heme and heme oxidation products such as biliverdin potently inhibit HCV NS3/4a protease. These exciting findings raise the possibility that MPs could be used as novel yet natural antiviral therapeutic drugs for treatment of chronic HCV infection. As a group MPs are inexpensive have minimal toxicity are easy to isolate and prepare and are abundant in life. Some MPs such as heme and Zinc protoporphyrin have already been approved for selective therapeutic actions in humans such as the porphyrias and jaundice of the newborn. Mechanistically our data indicate that specific MPs inactivate the NS3/4a protease across a broad virucidal spectrum of HCV genotypes. MPs also restore innate immune signaling for type I interferons after inhibition by viral protease suggesting that they will provide additional benefits for innate immune system recognition host immunity and viral clearance. The overall hypothesis of this application is thatheme precursors and selective products of heme oxidation are potent inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4a protease. There are three Specific Aims: 1) We will characterize the anti-HCV NS3/4a protease activity of Metalloporphyrins in vitro. 2) We will study MP inhibition of HCV replication and MP intracellular activities in vitro and 3) Study the anti-HCV activities of metalloporphyrins in vivo. The long term goal of our work is to identify the best antiviral agents of this class of compounds such that we can improve treatment regimens for chronic HCV infection and reduce the medical and social burden of HCV end stage liver disease for US veterans. The immediate goals of this application are to characterize the antiviral actions of MPs as well as establish thefeasibility of these compounds for therapeutic use in humans.","Adverse effects;Antiviral Agents;Antiviral Response;Antiviral Therapy;Bilirubin;Biliverdin reductase;Biliverdine;Binding;Cell Culture Techniques;Cell Respiration;Cells;Characteristics;Chlorophyll;Chronic Hepatitis C;Cirrhosis;Data;Development;Electron Transport;Enzymes;Generations;Genotype;Goals;HIV;Health;Health Benefit;Heme;Hemoglobin;Hepatitis B Virus;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Hepatocyte;Human;Icterus;Immune;Immune system;Immunity;Immunosuppressive Agents;In Vitro;Interferon Type I;Interferon-alpha;Interferons;Life;Life Cycle Stages;Liver diseases;Medical;Metabolism;Metalloporphyrins;Morbidity - disease rate;Mus;Newborn Infant;Patients;Peptide Hydrolases;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pharmacotherapy;Porphyrias;Protease Inhibitor;Protoporphyrins;Replicon;Research;Research Project Grants;Ribavirin;Signal Pathway;Signal Transduction;Specificity;Staging;Tetrapyrroles;Therapeutic;Therapeutic Uses;Toxic effect;Treatment Protocols;Veterans;Viral;Virus;Virus Replication;Work;Zinc;anti-hepatitis C;cost;heme oxygenase-1;improved;in vitro activity;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;liver transplantation;novel;oxidation;pathogen;resistance mutation;social;standard care;viral resistance;virucide","Anti HCV Protease Activities of Metalloporphyrins","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of cirrhosis and need for liver transplantation worldwide.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) forms a pathway for Na+ absorption in the kidney lung and other epithelia. ENaC is tightly regulated in order to maintain Na+ homeostasis and to control blood pressure. Defects in this regulation upset the delicate balance and cause disease. Importantly many of the identified inherited forms of hypertension result from defects in ENaC regulation. A defect in ENaC regulation may also contribute to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis. Thus our long term goal is to understand the mechanisms that regulate ENaC as a prerequisite for the development of more targeted treatments for these diseases. A convergence of recent discoveries has focused attention on ubiquitination as a critical mechanism that regulates ENaC trafficking. By reducing ENaC surface expression ubiquitination decreases epithelial Na+ absorption which is an important adaptive response in the face of Na+/volume excess. In this proposal we will investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ubiquitination controls ENaC trafficking. This work capitalizes on our previous discoveries that the E3 ubiquitin  ligase Nedd4-2 catalyzes ENaC ubiquitination and reduces ENaC expression at the cell  surface at two distinct steps in the trafficking pathway (endocytosis and lysosomal  degradation). Importantly defects in this pathway are responsible for Liddle's syndrome.  Moreover Nedd4-2 is a critical convergence point by which aldosterone and vasopressin regulate ENaC. Although it is clear that ubiquitination plays a critically important role in the regulation of epithelial Na+ absorption there are important gaps in our knowledge. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which ubiquitination regulates ENaC and hence epithelial Na+ transport. We will investigate mechanisms by which E3 ubiquitin ligases regulate ENaC  trafficking investigate mechanisms that regulate ENaC sorting in endosomes and  investigate the role of lysine acetylation in ENaC trafficking. By testing novel hypotheses and using innovative approaches this work will generate new insights into mechanisms by which ubiquitination regulates ENaC surface expression and hence epithelial Na+ transport and Na+ homeostasis. This may have important implications for our understanding and treatment of diseases including hypertension and cystic fibrosis.","Acetylation;Aldosterone;Attention;Back;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cell surface;Cells;Complex;Cystic Fibrosis;Defect;Degradation Pathway;Development;Disease;Endocytosis;Endocytosis Pathway;Endosomes;Epithelial;Epithelium;Equilibrium;Face;Goals;Health;Homeostasis;Hydrolase;Hypertension;Individual;Inherited;Ion Channel;Kidney;Knowledge;Lung;Lysine;Maintenance;Mediating;Molecular;Mus;Mutation;Myocardial Infarction;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Phosphorylation;Play;Population;Process;Recycling;Regulation;Role;Sodium;Sodium Channel;Sorting - Cell Movement;Surface;Syndrome;Testing;Ubiquitin;Ubiquitination;Vasopressins;Veterans;Work;absorption;base;blood pressure regulation;effective therapy;epithelial Na+ channel;innovation;insight;novel;prevent;response;stem;stroke;trafficking;ubiquitin-protein ligase;uptake","Epithelial Sodium Channel Trafficking","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Hypertension is a prevalent disease in the Veteran population and it is the most common cause of stroke and heart attack.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important and worldwide cause of chronic liver disease cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV is over-represented among veterans and the VA medical system provides care for the largest population of HCV-infected people in the U.S. Host immune recognition of HCV develops slowly following infection and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses develop weeks to months after infection if they develop at all. After viral persistence is established HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are readily detected in most infected individuals yet these T cells are ineffective in controlling viral replication. Although several vral proteins have been shown to interfere with various aspects of the host innate and adaptive immune response a clear mechanism by which HCV diminishes CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immune responses is lacking. In addition to liver disease HCV also is responsible for a variety of non- hepatic complications. The pathogenesis of non-hepatic HCV-related diseases may reflect abnormal regulation of host immune responses (e.g. cryoglobulinemia) chronic inflammation and/or decreased immune surveillance (e.g. non-Hodgkins lymphoma [NHL]). Fortunately antiviral therapy for HCV infection has dramatically improved in the past few years and the use of combination direct antiviral agents has a great potential for virological cure. However because HCV treatment may have serious side effects is expensive and is not completely effective it is important to better understand host immune responses to this pathogen for identifying alternative therapeutic targets and to facilitate vaccine development. We provide preliminary data demonstrating that the HCV E2 envelope glycoprotein competitively inhibits T cell signaling through the T cell receptor. Based on work in the most closely related human flavivirus (GB virus C; GBV-C) we hypothesize that E2 protein competes with the key proximal lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) by serving as an alternative substrate for phosphorylation. As a consequence of this interaction signaling is reduced following T cell receptor engagement contributing to persistent HCV infection a decrease in host immune surveillance mechanisms and resultant increase in the development of altered host immune responses. We further hypothesize that HCV E2 protein and HCV virions modulate immune responses in uninfected bystander cells including lymphocytes. Published work is consistent with HCV infection altering TCR-mediated signaling in vivo and that HCV proteins blunt proliferation following TCR stimulation in vitro in humans in and mice. Our preliminary work suggests that this may be mediated at least in part by HCV E2 protein and that the effect on bystander cells involves the transfer of E2 in exosomes to surrounding cells. In this proposal we will characterize the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 effects on TCR signaling and confirm the mechanism of the effects on bystander T cells. In addition we will characterize the constituents of HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 containing exosomes and in exosomes present in the plasma of HCV-infected subjects. These studies will characterize a novel mechanism of HCV-mediated immunomodulation that is likely to contribute to persistence and may influence non-hepatic HCV- related disease processes. Identification and characterization of this HCV E2 - lymphocyte interaction may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic and/or vaccine approaches to HCV and potentially to related viruses within the Flaviviridae.","Address;Adverse effects;Antiviral Agents;Antiviral Therapy;Autoimmune Diseases;CD8B1 gene;Caring;Cells;Chronic;Cirrhosis;Cryoglobulinemia;Data;Development;Disease;Flaviviridae;Flavivirus;GB virus C;Glycoproteins;HCV Liver Disease;Health;Hepatic;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Human;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunologic Surveillance;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Lead;Liver;Liver diseases;Lymphocyte;Lymphocyte-Specific p56LCK Tyrosine Protein Kinase;Mediating;Medical;Microbe;Mus;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Pathogenesis;Pathogenicity;Phosphorylation;Plasma;Population;Prevention;Primary carcinoma of the liver cells;Process;Proteins;Proteome;Publishing;Regulation;Signal Transduction;System;T cell response;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Vaccines;Veterans;Viral;Viral Proteins;Virion;Virus;Virus Replication;Work;adaptive immunity;base;chronic liver disease;exosome;immunoregulation;improved;in vivo;member;novel;novel strategies;novel therapeutics;pathogen;therapeutic target;vaccine development;viral RNA;virus envelope","The effects of hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 protein on host immunomodulation","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver and autoimmune diseases worldwide and is overrepresented in Veterans.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Depression is consistently one of the top causes of morbidity and mortality and veterans are afflicted more commonly than non-veterans. In addition veterans are more than twice as likely to die from depression- related suicide than the general population. Despite current antidepressant medications a disappointingly large number of patients are refractory to current treatments all of which target similar mechanisms. Thus new medications with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Using animal models that can predict antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects in humans we identified a novel molecule in depression and anxiety- related behaviors the acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1A). Pharmacologically inhibiting and genetically disrupting ASIC1A in mice produced antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test tail suspension test and following chronic unpredictable stress. Moreover the effects were independent of and additive to several currently used antidepressant medications. Disrupting ASIC1A also reduced conditioned and unconditioned fear behaviors which model post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. Together these findings suggest the exciting possibility that targeting ASIC1A will relieve depression and anxiety through a novel mechanism of action. To take full advantage of this possibility we need to know more about how ASIC1A is activated in the brain. The exquisite sensitivity of ASIC1A to low extracellular pH suggests that acidic pH might play an important signaling role. Supporting this possibility we recently identified a novel current during synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that depended on ASIC1A and ASIC2 and was inhibited by the ASIC antagonists amiloride and psalmotoxin. Furthermore inhibiting or genetically deleting carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4) a key pH-buffering enzyme in the brain increased this novel ASIC- dependent synaptic current. Finally loss of ASIC1A and the associated current was accompanied by significant structural and functional changes at glutamatergic synapses which we suspect may underlie the behavioral consequences of ASIC disruption. Based on these observations we hypothesize that ASICs and CA4 play key roles in depression-related synaptic physiology in the NAc and depression-related behavior. To test this hypothesis we propose to answer the following questions: 1) Do ASIC1A and ASIC2 contribute to synaptic and behavioral responses to chronic stress? 2) Does carbonic anhydrase 4 contribute to synaptic plasticity in the NAc and depression-related behavior? And 3) can inhibiting or deleting ASIC1A reverse effects of chronic stress on depression-related behavior and is the NAc a key site of ASIC1A action? The answers to these questions will provide important steps towards our long-term goals of better understanding the role of ASICs in brain function and behavior and learning to target these processes for therapeutic purposes.      ","ASIC channel;Acidosis;Acids;Amiloride;Animal Model;Animals;Antidepressive Agents;Anxiety;Anxiety Disorders;Architecture;Behavior;Behavioral;Brain;Buffers;Carbonic Anhydrase IV;Chronic;Chronic stress;Complex;Data;Dendritic Spines;Depression and Suicide;Emotional Stress;Enzymes;Epidemiologic Studies;Epithelial;Excitatory Synapse;Family;Fright;GABA Antagonists;General Population;Glutamate Receptor;Glutamates;Goals;Health;Human;Incidence;Ion Channel;Knowledge;Lead;Mediating;Mental Depression;Modeling;Morbidity - disease rate;Morphology;Mus;Neurons;Nucleus Accumbens;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Physiological;Physiology;Play;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Process;Protons;Refractory;Research Proposals;Role;Signal Transduction;Site;Sodium Channel;Source;Stress;Suicide;Swimming;Synapses;Synaptic Cleft;Synaptic Membranes;Synaptic Transmission;Synaptic Vesicles;Synaptic plasticity;Tail Suspension;Testing;Therapeutic;Veterans;anxiety-related behavior;base;behavioral response;carbonate dehydratase;disability;effective therapy;extracellular;learned behavior;monoamine;mortality;neurotransmission;new therapeutic target;novel;novel therapeutics;public health relevance;research study;response;therapeutic target","ASICs in the n. accumbens in depression-related synaptic plasticity and behavior","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Depression remains one of the greatest threats to veteran's health.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Leishmania species protozoa cause a spectrum of human diseases the most severe of which is visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL is a potentially fatal disease in which parasites disseminate throughout reticuloendothelial organs of the host causing a chronic wasting syndrome with profound suppression of host immune responses. After being deposited in human dermis by the sand fly vector the promastigote form of the parasite is taken up through phagocytosis by host cells of myeloid origin where it transforms to the obligate intracellular amastigote form. Throughout chronic infection parasites survive as obligate intracellular parasites primarily in tissue macrophages.  It was long believed that Leishmania reside exclusively in cells of monocytic origin throughout infection of the mammalian host. It is now apparent that parasites infect other myeloid cell types. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are the first cells to arrive at the infection site and internalize Leishmania. Preliminary studiesin this application demonstrate that Lic continue to recruit myeloid cells to the infection site throughout chronic progressive infection. Heterogeneous populations of immature myeloid cells with suppressive functions called Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells or MDSCs have been shown to suppress adaptive immune responses and modulate macrophage phenotype in models of cancer or transplantation. We propose herein to examine that hypothesis that myeloid cells infiltrating the sites of disseminated Lic infection have a suppressive phenotype.  The NLR proteins are cytosolic proteins that respond to either pathogen-associated or danger- associated molecular patterns. Some of the NLR proteins activate the multi-protein inflammasome complex resulting in activation of caspase-1 release of IL-1 and IL-18 and a potent inflammatory response. The non-inflammasome forming NLR proteins also affect host defenses through varied mechanisms many of which are yet ill-defined. We hypothesize that myeloid cells infiltrating the sites of parasite dissemination are responsible in part for the immunosuppression of chronic VL and that NLRs are critical determinants of myeloid cell function during Lic infection. We propose to investigate the following aims. AIM #1. Identify myeloid cells infiltratin the sites of Lic localization throughout infection. Hypothesis: Mature neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes infiltrate the site of parasite inoculation during acute infection whereas granulocytic and monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) localize to the sites of parasite dissemination once chronic infection is established. AIM #2. Determine whether NLR proteins exacerbate or ameliorate the course of visceral leishmaniasis in murine models. Hypothesis: Nlrp10 is essential for recruitment of myeloid cells whereas Nlrp12 is required for the development of a protective type 1 immune response.","Acute;Affect;Afghanistan;Animal Model;Antigens;Bite;CASP1 gene;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cancer Model;Cell physiology;Cells;Cessation of life;Chronic;Chronic Disease;Complex;Deposition;Dermal;Dermis;Development;Disease;Disease Outbreaks;Elements;Gene Expression;Goals;Grant;Health;Host Defense;Human;Immune;Immune response;Incidence;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Interleukin-1;Interleukin-10;Interleukin-18;Investigation;Iraq;Knowledge;Latin America;Lead;Leishmania;Leishmania donovani;Leishmania major;Leishmaniasis;Literature;Malignant Neoplasms;Middle East;Military Personnel;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Myelogenous;Myeloid Cells;Natural immunosuppression;Organ;Parasites;Pathogenesis;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Pattern;Phagocytosis;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phenotype;Population Heterogeneity;Proteins;Protozoa;Recruitment Activity;Research;Resistance;Sand Flies;Site;Spleen;Superinfection;Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes;Tissues;Transplantation;Visceral Leishmaniasis;Wasting Syndrome;adaptive immunity;base;cell type;high risk;human disease;macrophage;monocyte;mouse model;mycobacterial;neutrophil;obligate intracellular parasite;operation;pathogen;response;vector","Inflammation and NLR Proteins in Leishmaniasis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       The Leishmania species protozoa cause a divergent group of diseases the most severe of which is visceral leishmaniasis.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) remains an important clinical challenge despite potent antibiotics. Novel therapeutic advances await elucidation of the molecular bases for persistence chronicity and metastatic spread - i.e. the hallmarks of SA infection. The remarkable proclivity of SA to produce severe and chronic human disease reflects in part the array of virulence factors it expresses including a phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) that is secreted during its late logarithmic growth phase. PI-PLC is secreted during infection and is immunogenic making it a candidate as a virulence factor.  Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are at the front-line of cellular innate immune-mediated host defense against SA infection and PMN exert ~ all of their antimicrobial effort against SA internalized within phagosomes. During PMN phagocytosis and coincident with activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase granules fuse with nascent phagosomes and release their contents into the phagosome thereby exposing the ingested microbe to an array of toxic agents and a flux of oxidants that collaborate to kill microbes in phagosomes. However despite the presence of this potent PMN antimicrobial system 10-20% of ingested SA remain viable but not replicating in PMN. In response to PMN toxins in phagosomes persisting viable SA stimulate PMN to initiate transcriptional programs that dictate the fate of PMN.  SA-laden PMN have two potential fates: they may progress from atypical apoptosis to necrosis with release of viable SA or can be ingested by macrophages (Mf) thereby triggering phenotypic responses that promote further inflammation. Whereas Mf uptake of typical apoptotic PMN occurs without triggering proinflammatory cascades (i.e. a non phlogistic response) we have recently demonstrated that Mf ingestion of SA-PMN promoted aberrant cytokine responses. Persistence of SA within phagocytes has profound clinical consequences as signature features of SA infection are relapse metastases and failure of antibiotics to which SA are susceptible. In murine infection models PMN-associated SA recovered from an abscess can transmit infection to nave mice demonstrating that PMN can serve as a ""Trojan horse"" covertly entering macrophages (Mf) and then disseminating to cause metastatic infection.  Given our preliminary data we propose studies to test the overall hypothesis that SA PI-PLC serves as a virulence factor for SA by virtue of its ability to undermine phagocyte innate host defense. We hypothesize that PI-PLC may contribute to SA infection at two distinct stages: (1) early in infection before effective cellular host defenses have been engaged and organisms ingested extracellular PI-PLC will attack vulnerable substrates including those on recruited phagocytes and undermine their capacity to respond normally (Aim 1); and (2) later after ingestion by phagocytes PI-PLC-expressing SA within phagosomes will alter PMN-Mf interactions interfere with normal resolution of inflammation and promote infection and dissemination (Aim 2).

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in  the United States and is increasing in incidence. Because of the poor therapeutic  responsiveness of pancreatic cancer to surgery chemotherapy and radiation therapy  survival beyond five years is rare with median survival less than six months. Thus novel  and effective therapies directed against pancreatic cancer are needed to control  progression and metastatic disease. Our studies have shown that scavenging  superoxide with the antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD) or  pharmacologically with the nitroxide compound tempol have a strong tumor-suppressive  effect in pancreatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo. New data presented in this proposal  shows that overexpression of EcSOD leads to suppression of hypoxia inducible factor-  1a (HIF-1a). HIF-1a responds to reduced O2 availability by regulating crucial  homeostatic processes such as angiogenesis glycolysis and erythropoiesis and has  been suggested to be an important regulator of pancreatic cancer cell progression and  survival. As a transcription factor HIF-1 has more than 80 known target genes and the  number continues  1. Determine whether the effects of EcSOD overexpression on pancreatic  cancer cell growth inhibition are due to HIF-1a suppression by manipulating HIF-1a levels genetically and pharmaceutically.  to increase. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that themechanism for the tumor suppressive effect of EcSOD and/or tempol is caused inlarge part due to the suppression of HIF-1 in pancreatic cancer and that this suppression is due to the removal of superoxide. In order to examine this hypothesis we will address the following three Specific Aims:  2. Determine if pharmacological scavenging of superoxide in human pancreatic cancer cells with Tempol mimics the effects observed with EcSOD on HIF-1a.  3. Determine if Tempol-induced growth inhibition can be enhanced by chemotherapeutic agents (gemcitabine 5-FU) in human pancreatic cancer.    As reported in a recent NCI cancer bulletin article on pancreatic cancer the slow but  steady march toward more individualized care in cancer medicine has left pancreatic  cancer behind. Patients diagnosed with this disease live no longer today than patients  diagnosed two decades ago despite more than a dozen large clinical trials. Even as  many patients with other cancers have benefited from targeted drugs pancreatic cancer  remains as deadly as ever (http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/110309/page1). If  we can rigorously demonstrate that the tumor suppressive effect of EcSOD and/or  tempol is caused in large part by the suppression of HIF-1 in pancreatic cancer then the  results of this proposed research program will provide a foundation for the rational  design of a combined modality cancer therapy.","5 year old;Address;Age;Cancer Cell Growth;Cancer Etiology;Cancer cell line;Cessation of life;Chemicals;Clinical Trials;Data;Development;Diagnosis;Disease;Dominant-Negative Mutation;Drug Targeting;Erythropoiesis;Excision;Fluorouracil;Foundations;Gene Targeting;Glycolysis;Growth;HIF1A gene;Health;Human;Hypoxia Inducible Factor;In Vitro;Incidence;Left;Life;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of pancreas;Measures;Medicine;Mission;Operative Surgical Procedures;Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma;Patient Care;Patients;Population;Pre-Clinical Model;Process;Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase;Radiation therapy;Regimen;Reporting;Research;Role;Small Interfering RNA;Superoxide Dismutase;Superoxides;Testing;Therapeutic;Tumor Suppression;United States;Veterans;angiogenesis;antioxidant enzyme;cancer cell;cell growth;chemotherapeutic agent;chemotherapy;combined cancer modality therapy;design;effective therapy;expression vector;extracellular;gemcitabine;hypoxia inducible factor 1;improved;in vivo;inhibitor/antagonist;malignant phenotype;neoplastic cell;novel;novel therapeutics;overexpression;pancreatic cancer cells;personalized care;programs;standard of care;targeted treatment;tempol;transcription factor;treatment strategy;tumor","Role of HIF-1 alpha in EcSOD-Induced Growth Inhibition of Pancreatic Cancer","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Relevance to VA patient care mission: Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common  cause of cancer death in the United States with over 44000 fatal cases annually in the  United States.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       There is an increasing need for new and better vaccines to combat both infectious and malignant disease.  This need reflects an increased number of antibiotic- resistant microbes and new infectious pathogens as well as potential bioterror organisms. Many current treatments of malignancies rely upon nonspecific and highly toxic medications that cause serious damage to normal organs and tissue as well as malignant cells.  Anti-tumor vaccines offer the promise of more specific and effective treatments that better preserve the health and life quality of patients As the Veteran population ages there is increased incidence of cancer as well as autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Our central hypothesis is that understanding how immune responses are regulated by the interplay of multiple signals is key to development of effective immunotherapies including vaccines. One of the most important sets of such interactions is between signals that activate innate immunity and those that regulate the antigen-specific adaptive immune response. Understanding these interactions is crucial both to understand how the immune response works and to effectively manipulate immune responses. This basic immunology proposal is focused upon gaining a more complete understanding of how receptors for microbial nucleic acids interact with additional immune receptors in the activation of B lymphocytes with the long-term goal of applying this knowledge to better strategies in vaccine development.  During the current project period we gained important mechanistic insights into interactions between innate and adaptive immune receptors in B lymphocytes. These insights were applied both to the regulation of responsiveness to signals via the toll-like receptors (TLR) of the innate immune system and use of B cells as cellular vaccines. The work proposed for the next project period builds upon these findings to gain additional mechanistic insights and optimize B cell vaccine effectiveness. We will pursue two major experimental Aims: 1) To optimize the interaction of innate and adaptive immune receptor interactions in B cell vaccines using both a model response to an infectious pathogen and a tumor model and 2) To examine the interplay between signals delivered via the B cell antigen receptor toll-like receptors and interferon receptors in B cell activation innate immune tolerance and B cell vaccination.","Activated B-Lymphocyte;Age;Antibiotic Resistance;Antigen-Presenting Cells;Antigens;Autoimmune Process;B-Cell Activation;B-Lymphocytes;Biological Markers;Cancer Model;Cancer Vaccines;Cells;Communicable Diseases;Dendritic Cells;Development;Disease;Effectiveness;Excision;Goals;Health;Human;IFNAR1 gene;Immune;Immune Tolerance;Immune response;Immune system;Immunologic Receptors;Immunology;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Incidence;Inflammatory;Interferon Receptor;Interferons;Knowledge;Lead;Leukocytes;Malignant - descriptor;Malignant Neoplasms;Microbe;Modeling;Molecular;Mus;Natural Immunity;Nature;Nucleic Acids;Organ;Organism;Patients;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Population;Predisposition;Process;Production;Quality of life;Receptors Antigen B-Cell;Regulation;Signal Transduction;Stimulus;T-Lymphocyte;TLR7 gene;Time;Tissues;Toll-like receptors;Vaccination;Vaccine Design;Vaccines;Veterans;Work;adaptive immunity;cancer cell;clinical practice;combat;design;effective therapy;immune activation;improved;in vivo Model;insight;melanoma;microbial;mortality;neoplastic cell;pathogen;peripheral blood;prevent;receptor;response;tumor;type I interferon receptor;vaccination strategy;vaccine development;vaccine effectiveness;vaccine response","Understanding and applying innate and adaptive immune signal interactions","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Cancer and infectious diseases are major challenges to Veterans' health causing much suffering and mortality among Veterans.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Our microbiome influences how our immune system functions. Our microbiome has changed as a result of living in highly hygienic industrialized countries. A major change in our microbiome isloss of exposure to helminths (parasitic worms). Prior to the 1940's helminth colonization was nearly universal and there is strong evidence that this exposure helped to shape our genome. Loss of these previously ubiquitous members of our paleobiome can have far ranging immunologic effect. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) currently afflicts more than one million Americans and many thousands of veterans. The incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increased dramatically after the 1940's in North America and Europe. These diseases are rare in less developed tropical countries. Veterans that served in Vietnam or were prisoners of war are at lower risk of developing IBD than are other veterans. Moreover as countries develop economically the incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increase. Thus IBD is a globally emerging disorder. Although specific genes predispose to IBD there is strong evidence that a change in environment concurrent with socioeconomic improvement confers risk for developing the disorder. We propose that a change from our historic paleobiome the lack of helminth exposure in developed countries is an important risk factor for developing IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. We and others have shown that colonization with helminths protects mice from immune-mediated colitis encephalitis diabetes and airway disease. These are models of diseases that have emerged within highly industrialized countries. Understanding how helminth exposure decreases immune mediated diseases will guide development of targeted therapy to prevent or treat those diseases. Th17 cells control pro-inflammatory pathological responses like that of IBD. Recently it has become clear that Th17 cells are heterogeneous. In addition to making IL17 highly pro-inflammatory Th17 cells make IFNy (Th17/Th1). Other Th17 cells with a regulatory phenotype express FoxP3 or make IL10 (Th17/Treg). Immune mediated disease likely results from dysregulated Th17 plasticity. We discovered that mucosal IL17 production is inhibited by exposure to helminths and that this exposure decreases Th17/Th1 and increases Th17/Treg percentages in lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node cell populations. Our hypothesis is that helminth exposure protects against colitis by altering Th17 heterogeneity/plasticity. This project will test this hypothesis wth 3 specific aims. Our first aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that inhibit Th17/Th1 plasticity with focus on Stat6 signaling. Our second aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that augment Th17/Treg plasticity. Our third aim will explore how changes in Th circuitry alters intestinal epithelial cell function with focus on epithelial cell pSTAT3 expression. Our research is unique in that we are exploring possible root causes for the emergence of autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory disease in modern civilizations. In addition these studies will provide insight into how helminth-exposed individuals that live or served in less developed countries may respond to immunologic challenges. Furthermore we are examining in vivo how infectious organisms alter immune pathways to influence chronic inflammatory diseases like those that afflict veterans.      ","Affect;American;Asthma;Autoimmune Process;Back;Bacteria;CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes;Cell Differentiation process;Cell physiology;Cells;Chronic;Civilization;Clinical;Colitis;Country;Crohn&apos;s disease;Developed Countries;Developing Countries;Development;Diabetes Mellitus;Disease;Disease model;Encephalitis;Environment;Epithelial Cells;Europe;Exposure to;GATA3 gene;Genome;Health;Helminths;Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte;Heterogeneity;Human;Human Microbiome;IL17 gene;Immune;Immune response;Immune system;Immunity;Immunologics;Incidence;Individual;Infectious Agent;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Bowel Diseases;Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus;Interferons;Interleukin-10;Intestines;Lamina Propria;Life;Life Style;Link;Mediating;Mesentery;Multiple Sclerosis;Mus;North America;Organism;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Phenotype;Plant Roots;Population;Prisoner;Production;Rare Diseases;Regulatory T-Lymphocyte;Reiter Disease;Research;Resolution;Rheumatoid Arthritis;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;STAT3 gene;Shapes;Signal Transduction;Site;Specimen;Supporting Cell;Susceptibility Gene;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Th1 Cells;Ulcerative Colitis;Veterans;Vietnam;War;atopy;combat;gut microbiome;in vivo;insight;lymph nodes;member;microbiome;microorganism;mouse model;neglect;novel;novel therapeutics;pressure;prevent;public health relevance;research study;response;socioeconomics;targeted treatment","Modulation of Th17 plasticity by intestinal paleobiomic fauna","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic debilitating illness that afflicts many thousands of veterans.

Socioeconomic development brings hygienic lifestyles which alter our microbiome. Helminths (parasitic worms) were components of our pre-industrial microbiome (paleobiome). Our bodies have evolved ways to combat helminths and in the absence of that exposure may respond inappropriately to other challenges in a way that cause disease. This proposal uses mouse models to study how helminths affect immune responses in the gut to suppress IBD.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive movement disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy body. Clinically PD is characterized by resting tremor rigidity bradykinesia and postural instability. Inflammatory responses manifested by glia T cell infiltration and increased expression of inflammatory toxic mediators in the glial and neuronal cells are prominent features of PD. Neuroinflammation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of PD and may further augment progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Approximately one million Americans are living with PD. At present the annual combined direct and indirect cost of healthcare for PD patients is estimated to be nearly $25 billion in the USA. However the etiology of PD remains unknown; and though there is currently no cure but there are treatment options available such as medication and surgery to manage its symptoms. The lack of treatments for the progressive phase of PD represents a significant gap in the clinician's ability to treat this disease. The goal of this proposal is to study the role of glia maturation factor (GMF) a novel protein first discovered in our laboratory at the University of Iowa in the activation of mast cells and secretion of proinflammatory mediators that are responsible for neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of PD. Emerging evidence suggests glia-neuron-mast cell communications in neuroinflammatory conditions. We hypothesize that GMF-dependent activation of mast cell is associated with the pathophysiology of PD. We will elucidate the regulatory role of GMF in degeneration of neurons in order to provide a mechanistic basis for GMF-mediated pathogenesis in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. We will examine whether GMF is required in human and mouse primary mast cell activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and free radical that are responsible for degeneration of dopaminergic neurons following parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4- phenyl-pyridinium ion (MPP+) treatment in in vitro studies. We will analyze the mechanistic pathways involved in the activation of mast cells by GMF. Next we will investigate if GMF exerts its effects by modulating mast cells in degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in mouse models of PD. For this purpose we will use both MPTP-induced acute and chronic mouse models. We will reconstitute mast cell deficient (W/Wv) mice with bone marrow-derived mast cells from GMF-deficient (GMFKO) mice or Wild type mice and challenge with MPTP. We will analyze MPTP-induced neuroinflammation neurochemical deficits nigrostriatal degeneration and correlate with behavioral parameters in these animal models. The present study has significant clinical implications and provides an efficient in vivo approach to test GMF- suppression strategies as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases including PD.      ","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine;1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium;Acute;Adenoviruses;Affect;Allergic Reaction;Alzheimer&apos;s Disease;American;Animal Model;Antioxidants;Behavioral;Bone Marrow;Bradykinesia;Brain;Cell secretion;Cells;Chronic;Clinical;Coculture Techniques;Communication;Development;Direct Costs;Disease;Etiology;Exposure to;Facilities and Administrative Costs;Free Radicals;Functional disorder;Glia Maturation Factor;Glutathione Reductase;Goals;Health;Healthcare;Human;Human Pathology;In Vitro;Infiltration;Inflammatory;Inflammatory Response;Ions;Iowa;Janus kinase;Laboratories;Lewy Bodies;Life;Lipid Peroxidation;MAP Kinase Gene;MAPK14 gene;Measures;Mediating;Mediator of activation protein;Movement Disorders;Mus;Natural Immunity;Nerve Degeneration;Nerve Fibers;Neuraxis;Neurodegenerative Disorders;Neuroglia;Neurons;Operative Surgical Procedures;Oxidative Stress;Oxides;Parkinson Disease;Parkinsonian Disorders;Pathogenesis;Pathway interactions;Patients;Permeability;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Phase;Primary Cell Cultures;Proteins;Reduced Glutathione;Research;Rest Tremor;Role;STAT protein;Signal Pathway;Symptoms;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Therapeutic Agents;Therapeutic Intervention;Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances;Time;Toxic effect;Toxin;Umbilical Cord Blood;United States;Universities;Veterans;Wild Type Mouse;acquired immunity;base;brain cell;chemokine;combat;cytokine;design;dopaminergic neuron;effective therapy;glial activation;glutathione peroxidase;in vivo;mast cell;mouse model;neurochemistry;neuroinflammation;neuron loss;neurotoxic;novel;novel therapeutic intervention;novel therapeutics;pollutant;public health relevance;reconstitution;research study","Glia maturation factor dependent mast cell activation in Parkinson's disease","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious health problem in the United States and approximately one million Americans and estimated 80000 Veterans are living with PD.

"No NIH Category available","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       GB virus C (GBV-C) is a common human infection that until recently was not thought to be associated with any disease. Due to the perceived lack of pathogenicity blood products are not screened for GBV-C even though ~2% of U.S. blood donors are viremic at the time of donation. A recent large Canadian population-based case- control study found an association between GBV-C and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; odds ratio of 2.72 [95% CI 1.22-6.69]). Unfortunately due to an imbalance in sample availability the cases were not well matched with the controls. Nevertheless previous studies and several lines of evidence support biological plausibility for a relationship between GBV-C and NHL the 6th most common cancer in the US. Specifically GBV-C infection causes persistent infection of humans replicates in B and T lymphocytes prolongs survival of lymphocytes and is associated with delayed apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Specifically two viral proteins (nonstructural protein 5A and envelope glycoprotein E2) inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in lymphocyte cell lines. In addition hepatitis C virus is an accepted risk for NHL and GBV-C is closely related to HCV sharing considerable amino acid homology (up to 80%) in several conserved nonstructural replication-related proteins. In Specific Aim 1 we will determine whether GBV-C viremia is associated with the risk of developing NHL by using an existing clinic-based case-control study of 2500 cases and 2500 controls from the upper Midwestern US. In Aim 2 we will assess the relationship of past GBV-C infection (antibody positivity) on risk of NHL and prognosis and in Aim 3 we will determine if GBV-C is associated with event-free and overall survival in NHL. As a secondary analysis the association of GBV-C with NHL subtypes (diffuse large B cell lymphoma other B-cell lymphomas follicular lymphoma or T cell lymphomas) will be examined although power to assess subtype-specific associations was limited. This study fills a critical need to determine in an independent rigorously-designed and well-powered case-control study from North America whether GBV-C virus is associated with NHL risk and prognosis. Screening blood donors for GBV-C would be costly and require deferral of approximately 2% of donors. However if GBV-C is associated with NHL reconsideration of current blood donor screening testing would be necessary to protect the blood supply. By using an established case-control study cohort for which the samples will be available at the start of this grant and by working with leaders in GBV-C and lymphoma epidemiology and clinical research the study has a high probability of success. The laboratory that will perform the GBV-C diagnostic testing developed the state-of-the-art approaches to be utilized and has extensive published experience related to GBV-C research. The evaluation of a role for this virus in NHL prognosis is novel and innovative. Regardless of the results obtained this study has the potential to have a great impact on public health regarding transfusion medicine and potentially in the clinical management of  NHL patients.","Accounting;Amino Acids;Animals;Antibodies;Apoptosis;B-Cell Lymphomas;B-Lymphocytes;Biological;Blood;Blood donor;Blood donor screening;British Columbia;Canada;Case-Control Studies;Cell Line;Cell physiology;Cells;Characteristics;Chronic;Clinic;Clinical Management;Clinical Research;Clinical Sciences;Cohort Studies;Comorbidity;Data;Detection;Development;Diagnostic tests;Disease;Donor Selection;Epidemiologic Studies;Evaluation;Event;Family;Flaviviridae;Follicular Lymphoma;GB virus C;Glycoproteins;Grant;Hepatitis C;Hepatitis C virus;Human;Immune;In Vitro;Individual;Infection;Laboratories;Lymphocyte;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Measurement;Mediating;Medicine;Non-Hodgkin&apos;s Lymphoma;Nonstructural Protein;North America;Odds Ratio;Pathogenicity;Patients;Pestivirus;Phylogeny;Play;Prevalence;Probability;Proteins;Public Health;Publishing;RNA;Reporting;Research;Research Design;Risk;Risk Factors;Role;Sampling;Southern Europe;T-Cell Lymphoma;T-Lymphocyte;Testing;Time;Transfusion;Vascular blood supply;Viral;Viral Proteins;Viremia;Virus;Virus Diseases;Work;apoptosis in lymphocytes;base;blood product;case control;cohort;cost;design;experience;follow-up;in vivo;innovation;large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma;novel;outcome forecast;population based;prognostic;protein function;public health relevance;research study;success","GB Virus C and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma Risk and Prognosis","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       GB virus C a common viral infection of humans is present in ~ 2% of healthy blood donors and each day in the U.S. there are an estimated 300000 units of GBV-C contaminated blood products transfused.

Cancer causes ~13% of human deaths with 7.6 million people dying from cancer in 2007. More people in the US die of lung cancer than breast colon kidney and prostate cancers combined. Recent studies show that veterans are 25 to 75 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than people who did not serve in the military; yet therapies for lung cancer and other solid tumors are still limited.  Recent successesin T cell cancer immunotherapy point to a potential breakthrough in treatment. T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors or tumor-reactive  TCRs have cured patients with advanced metastatic disease. Intrinsic T cell immunity against tumors can be released using mAbs to remove inhibition by ""checkpoint"" CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors which has resulted in a number of cures in melanoma and lung cancer. Yet significant limitations exist for these therapies. Therapy is limited to certain cancers not all patients respond to therapy and there issignificant toxicity. Although showing great promise additional approaches to cancer immunotherapy are needed.  Treatment with  T cells expressing V2V2 TCRs is one such therapy that shows promise. In contrast to  T cells the antigen responses of  T cells expressing V2V2 TCRs are not MHC restricted. The major subset of human  T cells use their V2V2 T cell receptors to recognize the foreign-microbial isoprenoid metabolite HMBPP and the self-metabolite IPP. Normal cells and tumor cells from a wide variety of tissues can stimulate V2V2 cells. V2V2 T cells expand to very high numbers during many infections (up to 1 in 2 circulating T cells) and can kill tumor cells and infected cells as well as secrete inflammatory cytokines chemokines and growth factors. Two approaches are being used to treat cancer with V2V2 T cells. The first is to immunize with stimulators such as the bromohydrin analog of HMBPP or the aminobisphosphonate zoledronate with low-dose IL-2. The second is to adoptively transfer V2V2 T cells grown ex vivo. This approach has cured a patient with metastatic kidney cancer induced remission in another with breast cancer and induced partial remissions or stable disease in other patients but needs to be made more effective.   Metabolic engineering of bacteria is a new field of study that has focused on altering bacteria fordrug or chemical synthesis. Changes in bacterial metabolism are made by modifying biochemical pathways or by introducing new ones. We have now provided proof-of-principle for this approach by metabolic engineering Salmonella to overproduce HMBPP and demonstrating responses in monkeys. We now propose to improve our Salmonella vaccine and to test a new Listeria vaccine. Both species have been used for cancer vaccines but differ significantly because Salmonella is given orally whereas Listeria is given intravenously. We will use the bacterial vaccines to target and activate adoptively transferred V2V 2 T cell in tumors because they preferentially localize to tumor cells.  To accomplish our goals we will: metabolically engineer bacteria to overproduce HMBPP test engineered bacteria in vitro and in vivo in monkeys and assess the ability of metabolically engineered bacteria to target and activate adoptively transferred V2V2 T cells to control tumors. We have an outstanding team with an excellent track record and have extensive experience working with  T cells and isoprenoid metabolism. We have established in vivo models and techniques. A proof-of-principle Salmonella vaccine has been derived and the results recently published. The molecular methods to create more vaccines are well developed. In conclusion immunotherapy using metabolically engineered bacterial vaccines with V2V2 T cells has the potential to be broadly applicable for the treatment of many different tumors both by direct activation and through adoptive transfer.      ","Accounting;Adoptive Immunotherapy;Adoptive Transfer;Age;Antigens;Attenuated;Bacteria;Bacterial Vaccines;Biochemical Pathway;Blood Cells;Cancer Etiology;Cancer Vaccines;Cells;Cessation of life;Colon Carcinoma;Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4;Developing Countries;Diphosphates;Disease;Disease remission;Dose;Engineering;Environmental Hazards;Enzymes;Freezing;Goals;Growth;Gulf War;Human;Immunity;Immunization;Immunodeficient Mouse;Immunotherapy;In Vitro;Incidence;Individual;Infection;Inflammation;Inflammatory;Interleukin-2;Killings;Koreans;Ligands;Listeria;Listeria monocytogenes;Lymphocyte;Lymphoma;Malignant Neoplasms;Malignant neoplasm of lung;Malignant neoplasm of prostate;Membrane Proteins;Metabolism;Methods;Microbe;Military Personnel;Molecular;Monkeys;Natural Immunity;Normal Cell;Partial Remission;Pathology;Pathway interactions;Patients;Pattern recognition receptor;Persian Gulf;Play;Primates;Publishing;Renal carcinoma;Risk;Rodent;Role;Salmonella;Salmonella Vaccines;Salmonella enterica;Salmonella typhi;Salmonella typhimurium;Site;Solid Neoplasm;Stable Disease;T cell response;T cell therapy;T-Cell Receptor;T-Lymphocyte;Techniques;Testing;Tissues;Toxic effect;United States;Vaccines;Veterans;Vietnam;Work;World War II;Zoledronate;adaptive immunity;analog;anergy;bacterial metabolism;cancer immunotherapy;cancer type;cell transformation;chemical synthesis;chemokine;chimeric antigen receptor;cytokine;drug synthesis;experience;field study;high risk;humanized mouse;improved;in vivo;in vivo Model;inorganic phosphate;isopentenyl pyrophosphate;isoprenoid;malignant breast neoplasm;melanoma;men;metabolic engineering;mevalonate;microbial;mortality;neoplastic cell;prenyl;public health relevance;receptor;response;success;tumor","Metabolic Engineering of Bacteria for Cancer Immunotherapy by Gamma Delta T Cells","PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:       Many studies have found higher rates of cancer incidence and mortality among veterans. The average age of a veteran is 58 years old with most between 45 to 64. In the United States cancer accounts for 25% of all deaths with 30% of these from lung cancer. U.S. veterans who served in the Vietnam Korean or the 1991 Persian Gulf war are at high-risk for lung cancer since they are 25 to 75 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than people who did not serve. Also veterans were exposed to various environmental hazards and microbial infections. Despite advances in our understanding of the causes of cancer progress in treatment is still limited for many types of cancers. Our vaccine will stimulate a type of blood cells called ""gamma delta"" T cells for treatment of a number of different tumor types by immunotherapy.            ","VA","8922337","1/13/2016","BX-14-001","2I01BX000972-05","2","I01","BX","000972","05","","","10/1/2010","9/30/2019","Immunology and Dermatology A[IMMA]"," ","1880508","MORITA, CRAIG T","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","028084333","EJXSLDWM2BP6","US","41.653383","-91.540485","481031","IOWA CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER","IOWA CITY","IA","Independent Hospitals","522462208","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2015","9/30/2016"," ","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2016"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",
"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Recent studies estimate that between 28 and 75% of veterans also receive care from non-VA providers. Dual use is a concern because splitting care between two or more health systems and multiple providers may result in poor coordination of services and a loss of continuity - ultimately putting the patient at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Most likely one of the main reasons underlying the poor outcomes in dual users is poor care coordination. A recent strategy proposed to improve care coordination are Care Coordination Agreements which are written agreements articulating the responsibility for two or more providers. The overarching aim of the project described in this proposal is to develop best practice recommendations for dual use care for rural veterans which will be conveyed in the form of a White Paper completed by the conclusion of the 18-month study period. The White Paper will integrate both local and national research on 1) the scope and quality of information exchanged2) the level of patient care coordination 3) health benefit coordination between VA and Medicare and 4) satisfaction between VA and non-VA health care teams. In addition the White Paper will review results from a pilot study that explores care coordination agreements conducted as part of this proposal. The pilot study will be a randomized controlled trial of 60 veterans that compares usual care to an intervention which aims to improve care coordination for dual use rural veterans by educating them about the use of information technology to share health information and informing their providers about the extent and nature of care from other health care systems. The study will include an evaluation to determine the impact of this intervention on patient perceptions of integrated care coordination provider perception of relational coordination and the impact of the health information sharing as indicated by concordance of medication lists and lower levels of medical duplication when compared with usual care. In the context of this trial investigators will explore the acceptability and feasibility of co-managed care coordination agreements between VA and non-VA providers. Investigators propose to have an Executive Committee that would guide both the development of the White Paper and the pilot randomized controlled trial. Stakeholders from within the VA Office of Patient Care Services the VA Office of Rural Health the My HealtheVet Program Office and local administrators of VA fee-based care have agreed to participate. Non-VA stakeholders will also participate including local primary care leadership and representatives from Iowa's Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans. The goal of the White Paper is to recommend ways to improve care for dual use veterans that is acceptable to providers feasible within the current structure of VA health care and likely to improve the valueof care provided through federal health systems.            ","Address;Administrator;Affordable Care Act;Agreement;Caring;Cities;Development;Enrollment;Evaluation;Evaluation Research;Fees;Funding;Goals;Health;Health Benefit;Health Insurance;Health Resources;Health system;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Home environment;Information Technology;Insurance;Intervention;Iowa;Laboratories;Leadership;Light;Literature;Managed Care;Medicaid;Medical;Medical Care Team;Medical Errors;Medicare;Methods;Nature;Outcome;Paper;Patient Care;Patients;Pattern;Perception;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Pilot Projects;Primary Health Care;Protocols documentation;Provider;Randomized Controlled Trials;Recommendation;Research;Research Personnel;Risk;Rural;Rural Health;Services;Staging;Structure;System;Target Populations;Training and Education;Veterans;Woman;Women&apos;s Health;Work;Writing;adverse outcome;base;eHealth;improved;pharmacy benefit;programs;satisfaction;telehealth;tertiary care;therapy design;tool;treatment as usual;trial comparing","Dual Health Systems Users: Strategies to Implement Optimal Care Coordination","The overarching aim of the project described in this proposal is to develop best practicerecommendations for dual use care for rural veterans which will be conveyed in the form of aWhite Paper completed by the conclusion of the 18-month study period.

"No NIH Category available","   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Anticipated Impact on Veterans' Health Care: Veterans of OEF/OIF/OND are young increasingly female and include growing numbers of Veterans who have survived historically mortal injuries. These patriots face unique physical and mental health challenges that may be detrimental to future fertility; challenges include: sexual assault blast injuries causing genito-urinary trauma and traumatic brain injury chemical exposures and post-traumatic stress disorder. Thus comprehensive high-quality reproductive care including infertility prevention and treatment is vitally important for the post-deployment health and quality of life of this generatin of Veterans. Our goal is to better identify understand and treat infertility and to facilitate infertility care utilization for Veterans in order to make a positive impact on post-deployment health and quality of life for affected Veterans. Background: Responding to increased pressure from Veteran advocates and a Senate bill from December 2012 the VA recently renewed efforts to provide limited infertility care to Veterans. Very little is known about the true prevalence of infertility in Veterans especially in the male population or the impact of combat-related and sexual assault trauma on fertility much less the existing disparities barriers and preferences regarding infertility care in the VA system. The Pentagon is monitoring the number of OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who have suffered pelvic or genital injuries that could impact reproductive capability and traumatic injury benefits are now being paid to those affected. Sexual assault is an even more common trauma in female Veterans and a relatively overlooked issue for male Veterans; officials estimate that 26000 military members were sexually assaulted in 2012 alone (up 35% from the previous year). Our team's study of 1004 female Veterans suggested sexual assault is also a risk factor for infertility as well as for delay and avoidance o pregnancy. Other studies indicate duration of deployment concurrent mental health diagnoses and traumatic brain injury can also increase the risk of infertility in Veterans. Specific Aims: 1.Assess infertility prevalence in a nationally representative sample of reproductive-aged male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans. 2. Compare prevalence of infertility in those who have and have not experienced sexual and/or combat-related trauma and quantitatively investigate how physical and psychological injury and biological and behavioral alternations mediate risk of infertility due to these traumas. 3. Use qualitative methods to further elucidate associations between trauma exposures and infertility identify unexpected connections and explore Veteran-identified best opportunities for VA intervention. Methods: Guided by a novel conceptual framework we will use an explanatory mixed methods design: subject selection model for this study. To begin quantitative data will be collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI) with nationally representative samples of male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans <45 years old in order to determine the prevalence of infertility. Associations between sexual assault and combat- related trauma and infertility will then be estimated using accelerated failure time and logistic regression models. Next we will qualitatively examine infertile Veterans unique experiences exploring the complex relationships between trauma exposures fertility outcomes and infertility care seeking. Data will be collected using semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposeful sampling of subjects identified as infertile in the CATI. This qualitative study phase will ensure that all relevant associations are analyzed in the quantitative analysis and will also extend our knowledge of Veteran preferences for infertility-related health services. Our conceptual framework will help integrate the quantitative and qualitative components coherently while emerging itself as an improved framework to guide next step interventions.            ","Advocate;Affect;Age;Area;Behavioral;Biological;Blast Injuries;Caring;Chemical Exposure;Communities;Complex;Computer Assisted;Couples;Data;Diagnosis;Emotional;Ensure;Etiology;Face;Failure;Female;Fertility;Future;General Population;Generations;Genital injury;Goals;Health;Health Services;Healthcare;Healthcare Systems;Improve Access;Infertility;Injury;Intervention;Knowledge;Logistic Regressions;Mediating;Mental Health;Methods;Military Personnel;Modeling;Monitor;Outcome;Paper;Pathologic;Pathway interactions;Patient Self-Report;Patients;Pelvis;Phase;Population;Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders;Pregnancy;Prevalence;Prevention;Publishing;Qualitative Methods;Quality of life;Recording of previous events;Recovery;Research;Risk;Risk Factors;Sampling;Structure;Study models;Subjects Selections;Support System;System;Telephone Interviews;Time;Trauma;Traumatic Brain Injury;Traumatic injury;Veterans;Woman;aged;assault;care seeking;child bearing;combat;design;effective intervention;experience;follow-up;health disparity;improved;innovation;insight;interest;male;member;men;novel;physical conditioning;preference;pressure;psychologic;reproductive;service intervention;sexual assault;urinary","Impact of Sexual Assault and Combat-Related Trauma on Fertility in Veterans","The newest generation of combat Veterans includes increasing numbers of women and Veterans who aresurviving what historically would have been mortal injuries.
